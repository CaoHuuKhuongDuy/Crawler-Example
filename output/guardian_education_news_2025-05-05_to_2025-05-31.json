The children are the stars and they are going to be on screen all the time.</p> <p>“I can’t imagine many days filming when you haven’t got any children on set, so I think they are going to be in there most of the time and working very hard. They will be out of school for a period of six to nine months to film and complete each series.”</p> <p>Nathaniel McCullagh, a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.simplylearningtuition.co.uk/private-tutors/subjects/film-set-tutors/\">Simply Learning Tuition</a>, who has worked on both sides of the camera as a tutor and a director, predicted: “They’ll probably have a school at Leavesden that is essentially a series of classrooms with subject tutors, and they’ll wheel the children in and out of class just like a mini-school.</p> <p>“When you start building that level of establishment you’ll need management – a head teacher, a director of studies, individual tutors. It’s far more complex than a typical on-set tutor who is tasked with looking after a couple of kids for a few hours each day for a month.</p> <p>“I don’t know who is going to get the gig, but it’s a wonderful opportunity to look after maybe 30 children for months at a time and maybe longer ... They have got those children for 10 years or thereabouts, and they’ll be responsible for their entire education.”</p>    <p>Judith Phillips, who worked as a tutor on the original Harry Potter films, has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/nov/06/teaching-on-a-film-set-ive-found-myself-in-all-sorts-of-bizarre-locations\">told the Guardian</a> that the aim is for children to get at least 15 hours of teaching a week, with tutors on call from 8am. For crowd scenes such as Quidditch matches, up to 400 children could be involved.</p> <p>“Time is money on the film set, so when you get a knock on the door saying they need your pupil on set, it’s not a case of finishing up what you’re working on – it’s put your pen down and go,” Phillips said.</p> <p>Austin said the child actors she worked with were usually eager to be tutored. “The students we meet are very hard-working in general, I’ve yet to meet one who is a precocious brat. There are long, very boring days on film sets. Maybe in Hollywood it might be different but we’ve worked with a wide range of child actors and we’ve never had an issue with any of the students.”</p> <p>McCullagh, whose company has tutored child actors in Hollywood blockbusters, said chaperones played a vital role in managing children’s workload and making sure productions stick to the legal time limits on work, which vary with age.</p> <p>“The problem with being on a film set is that there’s never enough time,” he said. “It doesn’t matter how much money you’ve got behind the film, things go wrong. The lighting changes, the actors don’t quite pull off the performance they need or the director wants something different. So there’s always the temptation to say to a child: ‘Can you just do another take?’ That’s when the chaperone has to step in and say: ‘No’.</p> <p>“If children are on set being filmed two hours a day, they’ll be in makeup and wardrobe for another two hours,” McCullagh added. “They’ll be transported from wherever they are staying, but as soon as they get in the car or step into makeup, the clock starts ticking. It’s an enormous race against time to try and get them in front of the camera and do some acting.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/20/black-snape-harry-potter-paapa-essiedu-actor\">A ‘Black Snape’ in the new Harry Potter seems designed to cause controversy – but it could work | Jason Okundaye</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Charles Bonas, the founder of <a href=\"https://bonasmacfarlane.co.uk/en/\">Bonas MacFarlane</a> education consultancy, worked with some of the child actors on the original Harry Potter films. He said that while those playing the major roles had “basically hit the jackpot”, they were still having to give things up – as were those with smaller but still time-consuming parts.</p> <p>“There’s a wide point to make about what is in the best interest of the child,” Bonas said. “With these kids, like it or not, their academic education is going to take a back seat.

            "body" : "<p>A world-renowned children’s centre that provided the model for Sure Start is on the brink of collapse, with its future in the hands of the newly elected Reform UK leadership of its local council.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.pengreen.org/\">Pen Green Centre</a>, which pioneered wrap-around care and learning for preschool children in one of the most deprived areas of the UK, was the blueprint for Labour’s totemic early years Sure Start programme in the late 1990s.</p> <p>The early education minister, Stephen Morgan, is due to visit the centre on Wednesday amid reports the government is hoping to reboot Sure Start-style services as part of its child poverty strategy, expected in the autumn.</p> <p>The chair of Pen Green, Adam Cooper, told the Guardian the centre had been struggling to stay afloat financially because of “political” local funding decisions. “I’m incredibly worried we will lose the centre. Should it go, replacing it will be impossible,” he said.</p> <p>The centre has been locked in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/pen-green-childrens-centre-family-faces-closure-council-cuts\">a funding dispute</a> with its local authority, North Northamptonshire, in recent years. The council’s previous Tory leadership made no bones about <a href=\"https://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/people/anger-as-senior-councillors-decline-to-visit-pen-green-amid-funding-cuts-3599959\">its disdain </a>for Pen Green, cutting its funding from £1m to £300,000 in 2022 despite widespread public opposition.</p> <p>The survival of Pen Green, which is in Corby, an economically deprived post-industrial corner of a mainly affluent county, is being seen as an early test for the council’s Reform leadership, which <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/no-doge-style-redundancies-at-north-northants-council-but-workers-will-be-brought-back-into-office-says-new-leader/ar-AA1FkTIV?apiversion=v2&amp;noservercache=1&amp;domshim=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1\">took power</a> after May’s local elections.</p> <p>North Northamptonshire’s leader, Martin Griffiths, who was a Tory council leader in neighbouring Wellingborough before switching to Reform, has previously visited the centre and is understood to have been impressed by its services.</p> <p>In a statement, the council paid tribute to Pen Green and said it would “endeavour” to help it: “In relation to the previous Sure Start scheme, it was extremely respected and successful, and crucially it was funded centrally. When this was withdrawn, the initiative ceased.</p> <p>“We would welcome long-term centrally funded initiatives to invest in our children, young people and communities … [our] finances are challenging, and our statutory responsibilities have priority. If the Labour government can provide the finances to run initiatives such as Sure Start then they would be viewed favourably by this council.”</p> <p>Maintained nurseries are funded by Department for Education grants but councils have discretion over how the money is shared. Pen Green argues its problems arose when the previous regime chose to redirect extra funding traditionally earmarked for the centre to other nurseries in the county.</p> <p>The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, visited Pen Green three years ago. She is also believed to be an admirer of the centre, which was created in the early 1980s in a disused primary school and provides integrated nursery, health, family support and social care services for about 1,000 children under five each year.</p> <p>The centre, which is hugely popular locally, has trained thousands of early years professionals, operates a thriving research centre, and attracts hundreds of visitors a year from all over the world seeking to learn from its approach.</p> <p>Lee Barron, the Labour MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, said: “Pen Green really is the jewel in the crown as far as children’s centres are concerned. It epitomises Labour values and it is something I will fight to protect.”</p> <p>While No 10 and Phillipson recognise Sure Start’s popularity, especially with Labour voters, she has in the past <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2023/03/our-focus-will-be-on-reform-bridget-phillipsons-speech-on-childcare/\">downplayed</a> the prospects of a return to the programme’s generously funded glory days, saying change “will not come simply from winding back the clock”.</p> <p>A key Labour mission is to ensure all children, especially those from deprived backgrounds, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/11/toilet-training-and-cutlery-use-key-part-of-englands-school-readiness-skills-list\">“school ready”</a> by the time they reach primary age in areas such as language development, social skills and even teeth brushing – ambitions that children’s centres such as Pen Green argue are at the core of the services they provide.</p> <p>Recent research has found the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/may/22/sure-start-centres-saved-uk-government-2-for-every-1-spent-study-finds\">long-term impacts of Sure Start</a> were positive and cost-effective, producing better health, education and social care outcomes for families who enrolled in the programme during the 2000s.</p> <p>At its peak in 2009-10 there were 3,600 Sure Start centres in England, before austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/sure-start-numbers-plummet-as-cuts-hit-childrens-services\">scaling back or closing most of the centres</a> by 2018.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Guidance urging schools in England to serve children meat at least three times a week should be overhauled in order to increase the eating of vegetables and legumes, a leading charity has said.</p> <p>A report <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/publication/meat-facts\">published by the Food Foundation</a> has found that children eat proportionally more processed meat than adults, with more than a third (36%) of meat eaten by children coming from processed meat such as bacon, ham, and sausages, compared with 29% of adults.</p> <p>The study also found that 80% of the most commonly eaten meat dishes in schools and educational institutions are either processed or red meat.</p> <p>According to current government guidance, schools should provide a portion of meat or poultry for at least three days a week in school meals, which is part of the wider school food standards designed to ensure children have a balanced diet.</p> <p>However, the Food Foundation is calling for the requirement to be relaxed, and that increased consumption of fruit, vegetables, and legumes should be encouraged through a specific strategy. The charity is also calling for the strengthening of government procurement rules for schools and other public spaces where food is served, through a review of government guidelines. </p> <p>Rebecca Tobi of the Food Foundation, said: “It’s worrying that children are eating so much processed meat, especially in schools, where meals should be nourishing.</p> <p>“The government should review the Government Buying Standards for Food and School Food Standards to ensure they align with the latest health and sustainability recommendations. This includes relaxing the rule requiring schools to serve meat three times a week and reducing the amount of processed meat served.</p> <p>“This would let caterers offer more beans, pulses, wholegrains, and vegetables – improving health and cutting costs. Current policies don’t support children’s long-term health or British farmers, who face unfair competition from lower-standard imported processed meat.”</p> <p>The report also found that four-fifths of the most commonly eaten meat-containing dishes from fast-food outlets are likely to be processed and/or highly processed meat, while sausages and bacon are two of the five most commonly eaten dishes in casual dining restaurant chains.</p> <p>Processed meats, which can be high in salt and saturated fat, have been classified as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Cancer Research UK estimates that of the 42,000 new cases of bowel cancer that occur every year in the UK, 13% are caused by eating too much processed meat.</p> <p>Dale Vince, a green energy industrialist and campaigner, said: “This report exposes the shocking fact that 80% of meat served in schools is either processed or is red meat, both of which are classified as carcinogenic by the WHO. Who in their right mind would do such a thing?</p> <p>“One of the most powerful things we can do for our health and that of our children is to reduce the consumption of meat. That’s a fact. The science is clear, the benefits are obvious. The law is wrong.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Through our plan for change, this government is determined to give every child the best start in life, which includes creating the healthiest generation of children in our history.</p> <p>“That is why we are engaging with stakeholders on the School Food Standards to ensure that schools provide children with healthy food and drink options.</p> <p>“More widely, we are urgently tackling the childhood obesity crisis by shifting our focus from treatment to prevention, including by limiting schoolchildren’s access to fast food.”</p>",

As president of Haringey Teachers’ Association (HTA) in London for an unprecedented three terms, she helped countless teachers in difficulty, representing them in hearings and giving them the benefit of her expertise. </p> <p>She was a delegate to many National Union of Teachers (NUT) conferences, where she displayed a healthy contempt for the executive, usually sitting at the front with a knitting group, as if in front of the guillotine.</p> <p>Born in Tottenham, north London, to Grace (nee Bannister), a factory worker and dinner lady, and William Fulker, a roofer, Denise was evacuated during the second world war to her father’s native Wales with her younger brother, David. She completed her education at Tottenham grammar school and earned a university place, but after meeting Neil Hulson, an English lecturer, instead got married.</p> <p>They set up home in Palmers Green and had a daughter, Margaret, and a son, Jim. Neil died in 1964, and three years later Denise married Julian Tunstall, a solicitor she had met at the Young Communist League, with whom she had a son, Bud.</p> <p>Denise had trained as a teacher in 1957, and began working at Muswell Hill primary school as well as volunteering with the Woodcraft Folk. She went on to teach at St Aidan’s primary in Haringey, and became more active in the NUT and the HTA.</p> <p>She was elected HTA vice-president in 1982 and president the following year, after which she became assistant secretary, then deputy secretary, a role she fulfilled for seven years (1985-92). She took on nearly all of the casework for primary schools, and became responsible for the Haringey branch of the Teachers’ Benevolent Fund. She was the union nominee on the panel hearing pupil suspension appeals, and the teacher rep on Haringey education committee.</p> <p>In 1992 Denise was appointed office manager at the NUT London East office. Following “retirement”, she became chair of governors of Alexandra Park school and was also involved in running Haringey Young Musicians. She was so skilled at chairing meetings that in 1999 and 2002 she was re-elected president of HTA. </p> <p>An excellent cook who loved entertaining her many friends, Denise was loyal, generous and fun. In her later years, she enjoyed travelling, visiting Scotland and further-flung places such as Peru and the Galapagos islands, Egypt and Norway as well as many of the islands around the UK.</p> <p>Julian died in 1983 and Bud in 2017. Denise is survived by Margaret and Jim, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 11 June 2025. Julian Tunstall died in 1983, not 1993 as an earlier version stated as the result of an editing error.</p>",

On Tuesday, a university spokesperson confirmed that Gino’s tenure had been revoked, terminating her employment.</p> <p>Academic tenure generally prevents university faculty members from being fired except in extreme circumstances. The Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported that no instructors at the school had lost their tenure since the 1940s, when the American Association of University Professors implemented rules governing firings.</p> <p>Attempts to contact Gino for comment were not immediately successful, but she has previously maintained her innocence. Harvard did not elaborate, citing a policy against discussing personnel matters.</p> <p>Gino’s dismissal is unrelated to the attacks and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/trump-administration-news-updates-today\">funding cuts</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has inflicted on the university since taking office in January.</p> <p>She first arrived at HBS, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2010 as an associate business administration professor, according to her résumé, which also said she became a full professor in 2014 and headed the Negotiations, Organizations and Markets Unit from 2018 to 2021.</p> <p>Gino also presented her research at a number of conferences and spoke at various schools, and her work had been covered in media including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and NBC News.</p> <p>In June 2023, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Harvard had informed another HBS professor, Max Bazerman, that it believed one of the studies overseen by Gino – with whom he had published a 2012 paper – had falsified results.</p> <p>The paper in question involved findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which later retracted the work. The experiment asked participants to fill out tax and insurance paperwork, and found that those who were asked to sign declarations of truthfulness at the top of the page were more honest than those asked to sign declarations at the bottom of the page.</p> <p>Bazerman said the university had supplied him with a 14-page document showing “compelling evidence” of data falsification, including the discovery that someone had accessed a database to add to the file and alter it. He denied having “anything to do with the fabrication”, according to the Chronicle.</p> <p>A day later, the Data Colada blog – run by three behavioral science academics – <a href=\"https://datacolada.org/109\">published</a> accusations that detailed what it said were extensive evidence of alleged fraud in four academic papers co-authored by Gino. They said none of her co-authors were involved, to the best of their knowledge, and that they shared their concerns about Gino with the HBS in the fall of 2021.</p> <p>An internal investigation by Harvard subsequently found Gino had committed “research misconduct”. The university stripped her titled professorship and removed her from all teaching and research duties. </p> <p>After she filed a $25m lawsuit against Harvard and Data Colada, a federal judge dismissed her claims that she had been defamed but allowed her to argue that the university had breached its contract by imposing discipline that violated its own tenure policies, the Crimson reported. </p> <p>Gino has always denied fraud and wrote on a website dedicated to her lawsuit: “Once I have the opportunity to prove this in the court of law, with the support of experts I was denied through Harvard’s investigation process, you’ll see why their case is so weak and that these are bogus allegations.”</p>",

We have been entrusted with their legacy. Can we trust ourselves to uphold it?” Faust wrote in a guest opinion <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/opinion/memorial-day-democracy-crisis.html\">essay</a> for the New York Times.</p> <p>She highlighted, in particular, the principles fought and died for by Union soldiers in the US civil war and the roles played by the assassinated US president Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and leading Black civil rights leader of the 19th century.</p> <p>“We must honor these men,” she wrote.</p> <p>Faust, who led Harvard between 2007 and 2018 and still teaches there, did not mention the US president by name but she referred to his position and made a direct link between the civil war and now.</p> <p>Noting that about 2.7 million men, mostly volunteers, in 1861-1865 “took up arms to preserve the Union as a beacon of democracy at a time when representative government seemed to be fading from the earth”, she went on to warn: “Today democracy is once again under worldwide threat, assailed as disorderly and inefficient by autocratic leaders from Budapest to Moscow to Beijing, leaders our own president openly admires.”</p>    <p>Faust said that Lincoln regarded the Confederacy’s split from the Union, when southern states seceded in order to defend slavery and evade federal government intervention, as a “direct assault” on government by the majority “held in restraint” by constitutional checks.</p> <p>“Those structured checks and the rule of law that embodies and enacts them are once again at risk as we confront the subservience of Congress, the defiance of judicial mandates and the arrogation of presidential power in a deluge of unlawful executive orders,” she wrote in her essay.</p> <p>Critics of Trump lament congressional Republicans’ acquiescence to the president’s expansions of his authority and challenges to constitutional constraints, Democrats’ lackluster resistance, and the administration’s defiance of court orders over various anti-immigration extremes and partisan firings of federal officials and watchdogs without cause.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly accused Harvard of antisemitism and bias against Jewish students and attacked its efforts towards greater diversity on campus, and the administration has further demanded cooperation with federal immigration authorities, while harnessing federal powers to try to punish the university.</p> <p>Last Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/23/harvard-lawsuit-trump-international-student-ban\">Harvard sued</a> prominent government departments and cabinet secretaries for what it said was a “blatant violation” of the US constitution when the Trump administration announced it would revoke federal permission for the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based institution to enroll international students. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/may/23/harvard-university-sues-trump-administration-ban-foreign-students\">issued an injunction</a> within hours, temporarily blocking such a ban.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/26/trumps-revenge-spree-on-harvard-echoes-well-beyond-education\">Trump’s revenge spree on Harvard echoes well beyond education | Jan-Werner Müller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harvard had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/21/harvard-sues-trump-administration\">previously sued</a> in April over what it said was Trump’s attempt to “gain control of academic decision-making” at the university and the administration’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/31/trump-harvard-funding-review\">threat to review</a> about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/14/harvard-university-trump-administration\">$9bn in federal funding</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, Trump posted on his social media platform: “I am considering taking Three Billion Dollars of Grant Money away from a very antisemitic Harvard, and giving it to TRADE SCHOOLS all across our land,” adding: “What a great investment that would be for the USA.”</p> <p>By Monday afternoon the president had not followed up with action or further explanation or statements.</p> <p>Harvard’s current president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/may/13/trump-new-cuts-harvard-funds\">Alan Garber</a>, who is Jewish, has called the Trump demands “illegal” and said the administration was trying “to control whom we hire and what we teach”.</p> <p>Faust, a historian and research professor at Harvard, who was also its first president to have been raised in the US south, concluded her essay by acknowledging that those who fought in the US civil war did, in fact, save the nation and subsequently gave opportunities to the generations that followed.</p> <p>“They were impelled to risk all by a sense of obligation to the future,” she wrote, adding that “we possess a reciprocal obligation to the past” and that “we must not squander what they bequeathed to us”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My mother-in-law, Caroline Gould, who has died aged 93, was an artist and teacher – and sometime shepherdess. She lived an endlessly curious, well-travelled life.</p> <p>In the late 1950s, Caroline worked as an art therapist at Tone Vale psychiatric hospital, Somerset, when the therapeutic practice was in its infancy. Her humanistic view of art was influenced by the art historian Ananda Coomaraswamy. Caroline believed creativity was universal, and would share Coomaraswamy’s words with newcomers to her classes: “The artist is not a special kind of person; rather each person is a special kind of artist.”</p> <p>She returned in the 60s to her native Kent, founding Sidcup Pottery to make and sell ceramics starter kits. In the 80s, she taught art at south-east London secondary schools, including Coopers school, Chislehurst, and Bonus Pastor Catholic college, Bromley, and in the 90s ran “Look and Paint” adult education classes. She exhibited in the annual South East Open Studios event, her oils and watercolours capturing the beauty of Kent’s landscapes, and painted until she was 90.</p>    <p>Caroline was born in Farningham, Kent, the youngest of the four children of Gordon Guthrie, an engineer, and Kirstie (nee Stevenson). After Benenden school, she attended Sidcup School of Art (now part of Ravensbourne University London), before training as a teacher in Birmingham.</p> <p>She met Jack Gould, a toymaker, back in Kent after renting him workshop space in Sidcup. They married in 1968. Their honeymoon was a typically unconventional road trip to Italy in a VW campervan, collecting dolls for Pollock’s Toy Museum, London, where Jack was a trustee.</p> <p>A globetrotter since her teens, Caroline had been an au pair in Sweden and Italy, including caring for the children of the Tarzan actor Lex Barker. She had a stint at an Icelandic fish factory in her early 20s and travelled to Morocco and the Czech Republic in her 60s. In her 70s and 80s, she visited Nicaragua, Syria, China and Nepal.</p> <p>Her adventurous soul remained rooted in Farningham village, where she and Jack settled soon after their marriage. Caroline was a trustee of <a href=\"https://roperscharity.com/\">Roper’s Charity</a>, helping those in need locally, and she led a funding campaign that in 1997 secured the green space of Market Meadow for the community. She was also a keen bell ringer.</p> <p>Caroline embraced organic smallholding in the 70s, keeping bees, pigs, geese, chickens and sheep. She was an active member of the Jacob Sheep Society into her 80s, representing the charity at the Kent Show, and designing its T-shirts, book covers and a logo that is still in use today.</p> <p>A job reference written by her former school principal, Kathleen Bird, in 1953 remains a perfect reflection of Caroline’s character: “She has a fresh, original mind, clever fingers, good taste … In dealing with younger girls in the house she was good tempered, patient and stimulating.” Bird added: “We thought of her as an outstandingly good person.”</p> <p>Jack died in 2016. Caroline is survived by her sons, Rob (my husband) and Will, three grandchildren, Maya, Sami and Ruby, and her older sisters, Georgina and Jane.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My friend Theo Nichols, who has died aged 86, was a social sciences professor dedicated to the critical study of the relationship between capital and labour.</p> <p>Theo’s first book, Ownership, Control and Ideology (1969), was followed by Workers Divided (1976) and Living With Capitalism (1977), two case studies of work at a large chemical complex, while The British Worker Question (1986) employed his powerful prose to critique dominant accounts of low productivity and the performance of the British economy. He went on to publish another 15 books and edited collections including the classic study The Sociology of Industrial Injury (1997).</p> <p>Theo was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, as the only child of Wally and Min (nee Baker), both factory workers. Educated first at St Andrew’s Murray secondary modern school and then Lawrence Sheriff grammar school, both in Rugby, in 1957 he went on to take up social studies at Hull University. </p> <p>Drawn to industrial sociology, and after stints lecturing at the universities of Aston (1963-64) and Bath (1964-68), in 1969 he took up a lectureship at Bristol University, where he and I were part of the second tranche of appointments to its new department of sociology. In 2000 he left Bristol to take up a distinguished research professorship in social sciences at Cardiff, working there until his retirement in 2010.</p> <p>Theo was a principled man who had little time for authority figures, valued hard work and disliked unfairness. An avid reader, he loved walking his dog and watching Bristol City at Ashton Gate.</p> <p>His second wife, Nancy Lineton, whom he married in 1994, died 15 days before Theo.

            "body" : "<p>While many schools in England have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/10/majority-of-schools-in-england-ban-mobile-phone-use-survey-shows\">banned smartphones</a>, in Estonia – regarded as the new European education powerhouse – students are regularly asked to use their devices in class, and from September they will be given their own AI accounts.</p> <p>The small Baltic country – population 1.4 million – has quietly become Europe’s top performer in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s programme for international student assessment (Pisa), overtaking its near neighbour Finland.</p> <p>In the most recent Pisa round, held in 2022 with results published a year later, Estonia came top in Europe for maths, science and creative thinking, and second to Ireland in reading. Formerly part of the Soviet Union, it now outperforms countries with far larger populations and bigger budgets.</p> <p>There are multiple reasons for Estonia’s success but its embrace of all things digital sets it apart. While England and other nations curtail phone use in school amid concerns that it undermines concentration and mental health, teachers in Estonia actively encourage pupils to use theirs as a learning tool.</p> <p>Now Estonia is launching a national initiative called <a href=\"https://e-estonia.com/ai-leap-2025-estonia-sets-ai-standard-in-education/\">AI Leap</a>, which it says will equip students and teachers with “world-class artificial intelligence tools and skills”. Licences are being negotiated with OpenAI, which will make Estonia a testbed for AI in schools. The aim is to provide free access to top-tier AI learning tools for 58,000 students and 5,000 teachers by 2027, starting with 16- and 17-year-olds this September.</p> <p>Teachers will be trained in the technology, focusing on self-directed learning and digital ethics, and prioritising educational equity and AI literacy. Officials say it will make Estonia “one of the smartest AI-using nations, not just the most tech-saturated”.</p> <p>Kristina Kallas, Estonia’s minister of education and research, said during a visit to London this week for the Education World Forum: “I know the scepticism and carefulness of most of the European countries regarding screens, mobile phones and technology. The thing is that in the Estonian case, society in general is much more open and prone to using digital tools and services. Teachers are no different.”</p> <p>Kallas said there were no mobile phone bans in schools in Estonia. On the contrary: a smartphone is seen as part and parcel of Estonia’s highly successful digital education policy. “I’ve not heard of any problems, to be honest,” she said. “The schools establish the rules, which are followed on a local level. We use mobile phones for learning purposes.”</p> <p>She added: “We have local elections coming in October this year. In local elections, 16-year-olds can vote, and they can vote online through their mobile phones. So we want them to use mobile phones to do their civic duty, to participate in an election, to get the information, to analyse the political platforms.</p> <p>“It’s a little bit strange if we would not allow them to use them in school, in an educational setting. That would be a very confusing message to 16-year-olds – vote online, vote on a mobile, but don’t use ChatGPT on your phone to do education learning.”</p> <p>Kallas insisted: “We are not banning. We’ve given guidelines, especially regarding younger children – younger than 12 and 13 years old – when it comes to how mobile phones should be used or should not be used, but most schools have regulated it themselves.</p> <p>“They have regulated it so that mobile phones are not used during the breaks, and in the lessons they are used when the teacher asks for the phones to be taken out because there is some assignment or exercise that is done with the help of phones.”</p> <p>Rather than trying to resist new technology, Estonia has embraced it. In 1997 there was huge investment in computers and network infrastructure as part of its <em>Tiigrihüpe</em> (Tiger Leap) programme. All schools were rapidly connected to the internet. Now smartphones and AI are seen as the next step.</p> <p>Kallas talks about an AI revolution entailing the end of essays for homework, a farewell to the memorise/repeat/apply learning model relied on for hundreds of years, and a shift to oral exams. The challenge is to develop higher cognitive skills in young people, because AI can do the rest better and faster.</p> <p>“It’s a matter of urgency,” she said. “We are facing this evolutionary, developmental challenge now. We either evolve into faster-thinking and higher-level-thinking creatures, or the technology will take over our consciousness.”</p>",
