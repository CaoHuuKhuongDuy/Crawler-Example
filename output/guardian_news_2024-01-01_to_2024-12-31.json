She wrapped the CD in a note written in her finest hand, explaining that she thought he might enjoy the sounds of her friend’s band, The Necks.</p> <p>Others in our street had understandably complained about the endless noise because the sound reverberated through their walls, creeping into their quiet spaces, and ruining their days.</p> <p>But my neighbour did not. She delighted in it, sometimes standing outside our garage door and listening to him bash away at a song like it was her private concert. She walked the streets most days with her rescued greyhound who tottered along in fine leather booties to protect the pads under his feet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/31/since-my-husbands-death-the-intimacy-of-apartment-living-has-brought-more-than-just-shared-walls\">Since my husband’s death, the intimacy of apartment living has brought more than just shared walls | Nova Weetman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back then, we were living at opposite ends of the same street. Her in an apartment in a converted underwear factory and me in a rented townhouse. When the townhouse sold, my kids and I moved by chance into an apartment three doors down in the same factory and now, instead of sharing a street, we share a hallway. She was the first person I befriended in the building.</p> <p>She’s not from here. She’s a blow-in from the United States via a number of countries along the way. She has lived everywhere, from Thailand to Ghana, Japan to the New South Wales South Coast, gathering friends with each new address. An artist, she has exhibited in galleries across the world, and the many students she has taught are now friends. Sharp and curious, mischievous and thoughtful, she wades into conversations with a joyful openness.</p> <p>We chatter in scraps of conversation as we enter and exit our building at similar times. Sometimes our chats find us meeting up in cafes or outside each other’s doors, often lingering until we finish a thought. Recently we have begun sending wordy text messages back and forth, like a conversation that is always gathering speed.</p> <p>One day, she tells me she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/06/the-gentle-art-of-swedish-death-cleaning-a-rare-tv-show-that-will-change-your-life-for-the-better\">death cleaning</a>, despite being in good health. She is pragmatic about her age and her physical limitations, while longing to clamber up a ladder like she once did. We talk about ageing and how frustrating it can be when your body doesn’t do what your mind wishes it would.</p> <p>She employs my son to help her move things and sell them online. Awkward in that way that 16-year-olds can often be with adults, he is not with her. Perhaps it is her frankness and honesty that teases the same out of him. It’s as if she knows exactly how to speak to him to make him feel they are equal. She does the same with me.</p> <p>While separated by many years, we share more than an address. We talk about music and misogyny, our fear of another Trump presidency, of the changing climate, the genocide in Gaza and how to install solar panels on the roof of our building. She is a fierce feminist, a seeker of new ideas and thinking. Like many of the activists I see at rallies, she isn’t young, and yet despite knowing that environmental doom and global unrest will not affect her the way it will other generations, she remains outspoken, passionate, and alive to the world in ways that many aren’t.</p> <p>And like any good friendship, ours has grown to include the offer of borrowed books and home-cooked meals, sending both journeying up and down the hallway in an endless trade.</p> <p>Recently, she knocked on my door to drop off something or other and asked me in hushed tones if I was in love. It was a delightfully direct question and I laughed. She already knew my history, that my partner had died four years ago, and that I’d been trapped in grief and single parenting ever since, but she had clocked something had changed.</p> <p>Perhaps it was because I’d started wearing lipstick again, or the fact that I’d stopped wearing the same clothes from the floor and pulled out things that had settled in my wardrobe waiting to be rediscovered. I’d also begun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/04/after-our-first-cold-water-swim-our-teeth-chatter-and-hands-ache-and-i-imagine-the-spirit-of-mum-not-far-away\">swimming in the bay during winter</a>, stroking out into the cold depths of the sea, and slowly shocking my body back to life. I told her that I wasn’t in love, but that I had started tentatively dating, reigniting something in me I assumed had died when Aidan did. She told me she saw all this in my face, my body, and the way I walked along the hall.</p> <p>We decided it was a conversation that needed more than our usual allotment of time, so we met for coffee early one morning. Drinking cups outside in the strip of shadow on the street, she asked direct questions, and I spilled honest answers, enjoying the telling. Giggling, we traded stories of past flings and moments lived before. As we talked, the years stripped away from us both until we were just two friends laughing over coffee at six in the morning. </p> <p>• Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

The local police chief retired the following year, after complaints arose over alleged irregularities in the investigation of the death of the ex-wife of a Mansfield patrolman.</p> <p>Miller’s case was reopened several times during the ensuing years.</p> <p>Most recently, authorities reopened the investigation in 2021 to account for advances in DNA technology and forensic investigative techniques.</p> <p>“They examined the case as if it had happened yesterday, through an entirely new lens,” Bammann said at a news conference. “Their findings were staggering.”</p> <p>The chief said a “firm DNA profile” of Vanest, at the time Miller’s 26-year-old upstairs neighbor, emerged from evidence left from the room. Vanest had been questioned but never identified as a suspect during the initial investigation.</p> <p>This time, the Richland county prosecutor, Jodie Schumacher said the DNA evidence against Vanest was strong enough that her office was preparing a case against him for the killing to take to a grand jury.</p> <p>The case was never able to be presented.</p> <p>Police had found Vanest living in Canton, about 100 miles (161km) east of Mansfield, in November 2021 and reinterviewed him about Miller’s killing. He had admitted to lying to investigators during his first interview in 1981 and investigators sensed this time that he was trying to create an alibi to account for his DNA being present in Miller’s apartment, Bammann said.</p> <p>A Mansfield police detective, Terry Butler, sought a second interview in spring 2024, but Vanest refused to speak and requested an attorney. Authorities said he subsequently sold his house in Canton, bought a pickup truck and trailer and fled to West Virginia. He left several firearms at his Canton home and was stopped in West Virginia with two more. He was arrested on state charges and released on bond.</p> <p>The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took over his case and later indicted him on the federal gun charges. On 18 November, US Marshals and Canton-area Swat officers attempted to serve Vanest with that indictment at a north Canton motel where he was staying.</p> <p>“It is our understanding that when confronted by Marshals and the Canton regional Swat team, Mr Vanest pointed a gun at them and barricaded himself inside the hotel,” Bammann said. “After a short shootout, one Canton Swat member was shot in the arm, and Mr Vanest was fatally shot.”</p> <p>The chief said the department considers the case closed and hopes identifying Miller’s killer will bring her family some closure.</p> <p>Butler said his great-uncle was one of the first officers on the scene of Miller’s killing in 1981. He said he feels fortunate to get the chance to solve a homicide that happened when he was just 10 years old. People should know, he said, “we don’t give up, we keep digging”.</p>",

Out of 136 people on the state’s death row, Cooper had received 89 clemency petitions, according to the governor’s office. His office said it considered the facts of the crime, input from prosecutors and victims, “credible claims of innocence”, the “potential influence of race”, prison conduct, a defendant’s age and intellectual capacity at the time of the offense and other case factors.</p> <p>“After thorough review, reflection, and prayer, I concluded that the death sentence imposed on these 15 people should be commuted, while ensuring they will spend the rest of their lives in prison,” Cooper said in a statement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/26/trump-biden-death-penalty-commuted\">Trump tells 37 people on death row with commuted sentences to ‘go to hell’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His action comes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, in his final weeks in office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/23/joe-biden-death-row-inmate-sentences-commuted-clemency\">commuted the sentences</a> of 37 out of 40 people on federal death row, shielding them from execution under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union celebrated the clemency grant to <a href=\"https://www.cdpl.org/the-case-of-hasson-bacote/\">Hasson Bacote</a>, a Black man sentenced to death in 2009. Bacote brought a lead case challenging the death penalty under the state’s Racial Justice Act (RJA). That legislation, passed in 2009, allowed challenges to death sentences if defendants could show race played a role at trial. Lawmakers repealed the RJA in 2013, but courts ruled that people with pending claims were entitled to hearings, the ACLU <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/petitioner-in-landmark-racial-justice-case-in-north-carolina-receives-commutation-of-death-sentence-from-gov-roy-cooper\">explained</a> in a statement on Tuesday.</p> <p>In Bacote’s hearings, historians, statisticians and other experts outlined prosecutors’ discrimination against Black defendants in jury selection across North Carolina, the ACLU said.</p> <p>“Mr Bacote brought forth unequivocal evidence – unlike any that’s ever been presented in a North Carolina courtroom – that the death penalty is racist,” said Shelagh Kenney, deputy director of the Center for Death Penalty Litigation, which represented him alongside the ACLU and Legal Defense Fund. “Through years of investigation and the examination of thousands of pages of documents, his case revealed a deep entanglement between the death penalty and North Carolina’s history of segregation and racial terror.”</p> <p>A judge has not yet ruled in Bacote’s RJA case. The decision, the ACLU said, could have implications for everyone with death sentences in North Carolina.</p> <p>Others commuted by Cooper include Guy LeGrande, whose lawyers have said he was mentally ill and who had a scheduled execution date in 2006 before a judge intervened, the AP <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-death-row-commutations-caf7b04429dbe83f463600d6b0282b52\">reported</a>.

Previously, governors commuted five death sentences in the modern death penalty era, according to NC Coalition for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.</p> <p>“This action is smaller than we asked for, but it is still a historic step by a North Carolina governor to address injustice in the death penalty. The 15 men granted clemency today include people affected by racism in their trials, people who were sentenced under outdated laws, and those who committed crimes at very young ages, among other inequities,” said Noel Nickle, the coalition’s executive director, <a href=\"https://nccadp.org/nc-campaign-for-death-row-commutations-ends-with-a-historic-grant-of-clemency/\">in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Fourteen of the commutations were people of color, and 12 were tried before 2001 reforms implemented to prevent wrongful convictions, the group said.</p> <p>The announcement comes at the end of a year that saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/death-penalty-executions-innocence-public-outrage\">spate of executions</a> across the US that sparked significant outrage, including cases involving defendants with credible innocence claims.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Keir Starmer has promised to rebuild Britain as Labour did after the second world war as he enters a pivotal year for his premiership.</p> <p>The prime minister said in his prerecorded new year message that 2025 would be a year of rebuilding, with his government looking to turn the corner after a turbulent first six months in power.</p> <p>Starmer invoked the forthcoming 80th anniversary of VE Day in May as he compared the task his government faces with that the Attlee government faced in 1945.</p> <p>Labour ends 2024 with its poll rating lower than at any other year-end since the war, with <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/poll-labour-lose-seats-rghscklnk\">surveys suggesting</a> it would lose 200 seats if another election were held now. Starmer’s aides, however, insist voters will change their minds as they increasingly feel the effect of improvements to public services over the next few years, beginning in 2025.</p> <p>Starmer said: “That is what we will be focusing on: a year of rebuilding. But also, rediscovering the great nation that we are, a nation that gets things done no matter how hard or tough the circumstances.</p> <p>“We will have time to reflect on that this year, a chance, with the 80th anniversary of VE and VJ Day, to cherish the greatest victories of this country and the greatest generation that achieved it.</p> <p>“But that victory, and indeed the peace and the prosperity that followed, all rested on that same foundation we must rebuild today. The security of working people, that is the purpose of this government, the goal of our plan for change. And we will<em> </em>push it forward in 2025.”</p> <p>The prime minister is spending New Year’s Eve on holiday with his family, the first time he has been able to get away since becoming prime minister, after cancelling his summer plans when the riots broke out. Starmer delayed his trip for a day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/27/keir-starmer-pays-tribute-to-brother-who-died-on-boxing-day\">after the death</a> of his brother, Nick, on Boxing Day, but flew out to join his wife and children over the weekend with friends reportedly saying he badly needs a holiday.</p> <p>He will face a challenging in-tray when he returns this week, including the prospect of several more difficult months for the NHS, overly-full prisons and people continuing to cross the Channel in small boats in their hundreds every week. Labour is on 27% in the polls, the Conservatives on 25% and Reform UK on 22%.</p> <p>May’s local elections are likely to prove a major test for Labour. Reform hopes to make significant gains, particularly in more working-class areas that voted Labour in 2024.</p> <p>Some allies have urged Starmer to strike a more optimistic note after months of negative messaging about the state of Britain’s economy and public services, which some economists believe has contributed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/23/uk-economy-stagnates-gdp-figures-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-growth\">much weaker growth</a> than expected.</p> <p>But despite the reference to Labour’s radicalism in the postwar era, the prime minister mainly struck a cautious note in his new year’s message, focusing on the economic pain he said people continue to feel.</p> <p>“I know there is still so much more to do, and that for many people it’s hard to think about the future when you spend all of your time fighting to get through the week,” he said. “So I want to be clear. Until you can look forward and believe in the promise and the prosperity of Britain again, then this government will fight for you.”</p> <p>The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, gave only a brief new year’s message. “The Conservative party is also going through a period of change,” she said.</p> <p>“This process of renewal will be a long-term project. Things may be bumpy along the way, but the party I now lead is going to do things differently.</p> <p>“Watch this space.”</p>",

DNA testing was required to identify the bodies.</p> <p>On Tuesday the attorney general’s office informed the families that the bodies belonged to the boys and later <a href=\"https://x.com/FiscaliaEcuador/status/1874174814023491865\">posted on social media</a>: “The results of the forensic genetic tests confirm that the four bodies found in Taura correspond to the three teenagers and one child who went missing after a military operation on 8 December.”</p> <p>Antonio Arroyo, the uncle of two of the boys (who were brothers), received the news in tears. “They’re the children, the children are dead. My nephews are dead,” he said, <a href=\"https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/seguridad/estan-muertos-mis-ninos-estan-muertos-informe-de-medicina-legal-confirma-que-los-cuatro-cuerpos-hallados-en-taura-son-de-los-menores-de-las-malvinas-nota/\">according to Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo</a>.</p> <p>The families were informed after a hearing in which a judge ordered that the 16 air force personnel involved in the operation be held in custody while the investigation continues.</p> <p>About 200 people, including relatives of the boys, gathered outside the court in Guayaquil, holding banners displaying photos of the boys and slogans such as “Where are the children?” and “They took them alive, we want them alive!”.</p> <p>After being apprehended by soldiers near their homes, the four were allegedly released 26 miles (42 km) away, late at night, in an unfamiliar rural area. They have not been seen since. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence initially denied involvement, only later admitting that the military had apprehended the boys. The ministry alleged the teenagers were involved in robbing a woman, but the public prosecutor investigating the case stated that there was no evidence to support this.</p> <p>Before the confirmation of the deaths, the case was already considered the greatest popularity crisis for Noboa’s hardline security policy, imposed after he declared a state of “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/ecuador-at-war-with-drug-gangs-says-president-as-violence-continues\">internal armed conflict</a>” in January, with the armed forces at the centre of his project.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/seguridad/devuelvan-a-nuestros-ninos-el-pedido-de-planton-en-quito-por-cuatro-menores-desaparecidos-en-las-malvinas-nota/\">Protests across the country</a> have marked the last days, and some believe that the situation could intensify.</p> <p>“There is total sadness in the vulnerable communities of Guayaquil,” said Arturo Ramírez Morán, a professor at the Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil. “In an environment filled with impotence, violence against the state can flare up in the blink of an eye.”</p> <p>Public prosecutors are now investigating whether the military were responsible for the deaths. The Ministry of Defence had claimed that the boys <a href=\"https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/seguridad/bloque-de-seguridad-senala-a-grupos-delincuenciales-por-desaparicion-de-cuatro-menores-en-guayaquil-nota/\">could have become victims of organised crime</a> after being released.</p> <p>The 16 soldiers are being investigated for “forced disappearance” – a crime with a sentence of 22 to 26 years in prison.</p> <p><br></p>",

            "body" : "<p>Over the past year, I’ve had the privilege of serving as chair of the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions (Help). As I leave that position, let me reflect upon where I think our country should be going in healthcare, and the obstacles we face.</p> <p>We are the wealthiest nation on Earth. There is no rational reason as to why we are not the healthiest nation on Earth. We should be leading the world in terms of life expectancy, disease prevention, low infant and maternal mortality, quality of life and human happiness. Sadly, study after study shows just the opposite. Despite spending almost twice as much per capita on healthcare, we trail most wealthy nations in all these areas.</p> <p>If we’re going to reform our broken and dysfunctional healthcare system and “Make America healthy again”, this is <em>some</em> of what we must do.</p> <h2>Medicare for All</h2> <p>Healthcare is a human right. The function of a rational healthcare system is to guarantee quality healthcare to all, not huge profits for the insurance industry. The United States cannot continue to be the only wealthy nation that does not provide universal healthcare. It is not acceptable that, while spending almost 18% of our GDP on healthcare, millions of Americans delay going to the doctor and 60,000 Americans die each year because they can’t afford the care they need.</p> <h2>Lower the cost of prescription drugs</h2> <p>As Americans, we should not be paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for life-saving medications. It is absurd that while the pharmaceutical industry enjoys huge profits and benefits from US taxpayer research, one out of four Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. We must cut prescription drug prices in half by making sure that we pay no more for medicine than the Europeans or Canadians.</p> <h2>Paid family and medical leave</h2> <p>Workers should not have to go to work when they are sick. Mothers and fathers should have ample time to stay home with their newborn babies. A parent should not get fired when they stay home with a sick child. We must guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to every worker in America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/10/united-healthcare-insurance-rsv\">My daughter could have died. I blame US insurance companies | Melody Schreiber</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Reform the food industry</h2> <p>Large food corporations should not make record-breaking profits making children addicted to processed foods, which make them overweight and prone to diabetes and other diseases. As a start, we must ban junk-food ads targeted to kids and put strong warning labels on products high in sugar, salt and saturated fat. Longer term, we can rebuild rural America with family farms that are producing healthy, nutritious food.</p> <h2>Raise the minimum wage to a living wage</h2> <p>Millions of workers should not have to worry about how they’ll pay the rent or buy food for their kids. Working-class Americans live far shorter lives than the rich because of the stress of trying to survive on a paycheck-to-paycheck existence. Stress kills. Stress makes us sick. We must raise the minimum wage to at least $17 an hour.</p> <h2>Lower the work week to 32 hours with no loss of pay</h2> <p>People will live longer and healthier lives if they can spend more time with family and friends and have the opportunity to enjoy their leisure time. Advancements in technology, automation and artificial intelligence must benefit workers, not just billionaires on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley.</p> <h2>Combat the epidemic of loneliness, isolation and mental illness</h2> <p>Too many Americans are struggling with intense anxiety and “diseases of despair” – alcoholism, drug addiction and even suicide. Not only do we need to greatly increase access to mental healthcare, we must rebuild our sense of community and create a culture in which we better enjoy and appreciate each other as human beings. We must also take a very hard look at the impact smartphones and social media are having on our mental and physical health.</p> <h2>Address the climate and environmental crisis</h2> <p>Every American is affected when the Earth’s temperature rises and the air we breathe is polluted. Climate crisis and extreme weather disturbances will cause more widespread suffering and disease, economic disruptions and population dislocation. Air pollution is a major risk factor for respiratory and heart disease, cancer and other health problems. The fossil-fuel industry cannot be allowed to continue making us sick, shortening our lives and destroying the planet.</p> <h2>Create a high-quality public education system</h2> <p>Life-long education is a human right and should be obtainable for all in a wealthy nation like ours. Health, life expectancy and economic wellbeing are often tied to educational attainment. Instead of spending $1tn a year on the military we should make certain that all Americans, from childcare to graduate school, are able to enjoy free, high-quality education and job training.</p> <p>Let’s be clear. The way forward to creating a healthy society is not radical or complicated. Many of the components that I’ve outlined already exist, in one form or another, in numerous countries throughout the world.</p> <p>Our real problem is not so much a healthcare crisis as it is a political and economic one. We need to end the unprecedented level of corporate greed we are experiencing. We need to create a government and economy that works for all and not just the wealthy and powerful few.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://sanders.senate.gov/\">Bernie Sanders</a> is a US senator, and chair of the health education labor and pensions committee.

A Manxwoman, she lived and breathed the island, leading a life of determination, intellectual curiosity and resilience.</p> <p>After departing for Scotland and eventual teacher training at Craigie College of Education in Ayr (1965-68), Joyce went on to complete 20 years as a teacher. This was mostly undertaken in Scotland, at Fisherton, Newton Head and Girvan primary schools in Ayrshire, from 1969 to the end of the 1980s. Then, in 1988-89, she joined Saints John and Monica primary school in Birmingham and a private school in Ibiza. During this time, Joyce would often return to the Isle of Man, her “dear old Ellan Vannin”.</p> <p>Born in the Manx town of Peel, Joyce was one of the eight children of Frank Gallagher, a mariner, and his wife, Kitty (nee Ross). A bright student, Joyce was offered a scholarship to Buchan school on the island, but the family did not have the money to buy a uniform. Times were especially tough during the second world war, as Frank was away on naval service. Instead, Joyce attended Douglas high school for girls.</p> <p>She left school at 17 and, in 1950, married Robert McCrindle, a Scottish fisherman whom she had met at Peel harbour while he was working there. Robert came from a seagoing Ayrshire family and Joyce moved to the village of Maidens on the Clyde coast.</p> <p>There she made her home. But, in the mid-60s, Robert suffered a series of heart disorders and had to quit the sea and the family boat. Joyce, who was only in her early 30s, with four young children and no income, returned to education to earn a living. </p> <p>Robert’s health gradually worsened, and he died aged 57 in 1988. Joyce remained in Maidens after his death. Always a restless spirit, and an enthusiast for travel, she packed her holiday suitcase as often as possible.</p> <p>Trips included the great museums and concert halls of the world, from New York, Shanghai and Paris to the Prado in Madrid. If she was not heading for an airport or bus depot, she would be researching her next trip. Her travels were woven into her teaching, opening up the world of art, history and (sometimes) opera to the young of Ayrshire.</p> <p>In 2020, Joyce moved into sheltered housing in Girvan then to Creggan Bahn Court nursing home in Ayr for her final months, where she would proudly tell staff: “I circumnavigated the globe, you know.”</p> <p>She is survived by her four children, Kathryn, Rosemary, Sean and my wife, Jane, nine grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, an older sister, Mary, and two younger sisters, Susan and Lorraine.</p>",

The weather on Tuesday was cooler than most days, she added, so the lack of air conditioning has not been as bad as during previous blackouts.</p> <p>Puerto Ricans have been accustomed to frequent blackouts, which have worsened after Hurricane Maria in 2017 severely damaged the island.<strong> </strong>There was another blackout in June affecting about 350,000 customers on the island.</p> <p>The New Year’s Eve outage appears to be significantly bigger than the previous blackout.</p> <p>Jenaro Abraham, an associate professor at Gonzaga University and a member of the social democratic Puerto Rican Independence party, has family members living on the island.</p> <p>“It’s been a very tough few years for Puerto Ricans, and these are some of the few moments Puerto Ricans can escape from reality and be with family and friends and be thankful for all the wonderful things you still have – and then all of a sudden the blackout happens,” Abraham said.</p> <p>The blackouts and the island’s power grid problems have also become a source of political tension for Puerto Ricans.</p> <p>Abraham said: “This emanates from a structural crisis that Puerto Rico is experiencing from US colonial rule.”</p> <p>In 2016, an Obama-era federal law instituted significant changes for Puerto Rico to address the island’s crippling debt. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (Promesa) board, in charge of policy changes on the island, recommended the privatization of the publicly owned electric grid, known as the Puerto Rico Power Authority (Prepa).</p> <p>After the 2017 hurricane took out the electric grid, the island’s then governor announced the sale of Prepa and the privatization the energy distribution network.</p> <p>“[The privatization of Prepa] managed to prop up very predatory actors like Luma, a company based in the United States, where they basically thrive off of Puerto Rico’s vulnerability,” Abraham said.</p> <p>“ It’s definitely a source of much contention and much anger among Puerto Ricans, because Puerto Ricans felt that they never chose Luma, they never chose the fiscal oversight board, they didn’t vote for any of these things.”</p> <p>Ortiz said: “The blackouts have been worse. People have been angry for a while now. This is just what we needed to end the year.”</p> <p>The incoming governor, Jenniffer González-Colón, who is set to be sworn in on 2 January, plans to name an “energy czar” to review the contract with Luma and search for another power grid operator, per the Associated Press.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Israeli players will now be free to compete at next month’s World Indoor Bowls Championships in Norfolk after tournament organisers revoked a ban.</p> <p>Three Israelis had been expected to play at the tournament in Hopton-on-Sea – with Daniel Alomin due to feature in the singles and Amnon Amar and Itai Rigbi in the pairs – but their invitations were withdrawn.</p> <p>The initial ban came following a campaign by pro-Palestinian groups with the World Bowls Tour (WBT) suggesting its decision had been taken after the involvement of Israeli bowlers at the Scottish International Open in August had produced “a significant escalation in related political concerns”.</p> <p>The WBT said the decision “was not taken lightly” and had been made “in the best interests of the event’s success and integrity”. The call was widely condemned by Jewish groups and the local MP, Rupert Lowe, who called it a victory for “the mob”.</p> <p>However, on Tuesday, the WBT issued a new statement confirming that the three players would be free to compete and offered an apology.</p> <p>It read: “We would firstly wish to extend our sincere apologies to both you and to PBA Israel, for any upset or offence that we have caused by the withdrawal of the invitation to the three members of PBA Israel in advance of the January 2025 championships. This was absolutely not our intention; however as we made clear, we had found ourselves in a very difficult position in relation to the security of the venue and to the competitors and other attendees.</p> <p>“However, over the past 48 hours we have been exploring practical ways in which our concerns could be overcome, so as to enable the invitation to PBA Israel to be reinstated. We are pleased to say that following discussions with various partner agencies, we have been able to confirm today an increase in the security presence at the event. The WBT Board is accordingly satisfied that this increased level of security which will be in place is sufficient to be able to welcome the PBA Israel Team to the event starting on 10 January 2025.</p> <p>“We are very pleased about being able to reverse the decision to withdraw the invitation which we regrettably felt compelled to take in all the circumstances. The sole consideration behind this difficult decision had been the safety and security of all participants, staff, and attendees involved in the tournament. Following significant feedback and credible concerns regarding the potential risks posed to competitors we had felt it necessary to act responsibly, so to ensure the wellbeing of everyone involved.”</p> <p>Earlier in the day Lowe, whose Great Yarmouth constituency includes Hopton-on-Sea, said he was “genuinely disgusted” by the decision which he described as “pure insanity”. “This is following a concerted campaign from the pro-Palestine mob to have these Israelis barred from competing,” the Reform party MP wrote on X. “I am genuinely disgusted. As far as I am concerned as the local MP, these individuals are welcome in our constituency.”</p> <p>He added: “What message does this send? If the mob screams and shouts, they can get competitors of a certain nationality banned from entry? It is insanity, pure insanity. The organisers are cowards. Sport should be a unifier, and it should be above politics.”</p> <p>The Board of Deputies of British Jews said there was no justification for an “overt act of discrimination against Israeli participants, who are excluded solely on the basis of their nationality”.</p> <p>Potters Resorts, which has hosted the tournament since 1999, also said it was not involved in deciding who was invited. A spokesperson said: “While Potters Resorts is proud to host the event, we are not involved in decisions regarding player participation and remain a neutral venue for this prestigious competition.”</p>",

            "body" : "<h2>January</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>8 Jan, Wigan (a), FA Cup, 2-0 win; 14 Jan, Tottenham (h) 2-2 draw; 28 Jan, Newport County (a), FA Cup, 4-2 win</em></p></li> </ul> <p>A slow start to the new year, though the bright and shiny new ownership regime of Sir Jim Ratcliffe is quick to make waves, the man himself gatecrashing the press room before the Tottenham game to say: “I have done a few exciting things, but this caps it all.” Ratcliffe the thrill-seeker may have felt a few jolts as League Two Newport County mount a near-comeback in the FA Cup, only for United to escape south Wales after late goals. Jadon Sancho, a £73m transfer bust, heads back to Borussia Dortmund on loan, while Marcus Rashford is disciplined for missing training after nightclubbing in Belfast. “Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions,” says a club statement. With key Ratcliffe adviser Sir Dave Brailsford mounting “a review of transfer strategy”, no new players come in.</p> <h2>February</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>1 Feb, Wolves (a), 4-3 win; 4 Feb, West Ham (h), 3-0 win; 11 Feb, Aston Villa (a), 2-1 win; 18 Feb, Luton (a) 2-1 win; 24 Feb, Fulham (h), 2-1 defeat; 28 Feb, Nottingham Forest (a), FA Cup, 1-0 win</em></p></li> </ul> <p>In a dramatic win at Wolves, Kobbie Mainoo, a young midfielder back from injury, grabs the headlines. Lisandro Martínez’s knee injury against West Ham stretches resources and Erik ten Hag is forced to deny that keeping his former Ajax lieutenant on the field aggravated the problem. Meanwhile, as Ratcliffe’s deal is ratified on 20 February, moves to entice Dan Ashworth’s sporting director mastery from Newcastle are made, and Jason Wilcox, a former Manchester City employee, is to join as technical director from Southampton. “We are back in the race, but not in the position we want to be at this club,” says Ten Hag after five wins in seven. United duly lose at home to Fulham the next week.</p> <h2>March</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>3 Mar, Manchester City (a), 3-1 defeat; 9 Mar, Everton (h), 2-0 win; 17 Mar, Liverpool (h) FA Cup, 4-3 win (aet); 30 Mar, Brentford (a), 1-1 draw</em></p></li> </ul> <p>Losing 3-1 in the Manchester derby further dims talk of title challenges. Still, Ten Hag denies there is a gulf in class to Pep Guardiola’s multi-champions. “No, I don’t think so, absolutely not,” he says. Salvation lies in the FA Cup, where Amad Diallo, signed in 2021, belatedly announces himself with a superb winner of an all-time classic quarter-final defeat of Liverpool. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe says his Manchester United won’t be following the <em>gal</em><em>áctico</em> transfer model. “The solution isn’t spending a lot of money on a couple of great players,” he says. He is more focused on a new stadium, and getting someone else to pay for it. “If you built a completely new ground it would absolutely be state-of-the-art, world class, 90,000 [capacity] or maybe even 100,000.”</p>    <h2>April</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>4 Apr, Chelsea (a), 4-3 defeat; 7 Apr, Liverpool (h), 2-2 draw; 13 Apr, Bournemouth (a) 2-2 draw; 21 Apr, Coventry, FA Cup, 3-3 (aet; win 4-2 on pens); 24 Apr, Sheffield United (h) 4-2 win; 27 Apr, Burnley (h), 1-1 draw</em></p></li> </ul> <p>United will be in the FA Cup final but their defeat of the Championship side Coventry is nothing like a moral victory after Victor Torp’s “winner” is chalked off by the video assistant referee for offside. “There was a lack of discipline … today we got away with it,” says Ten Hag as the 1990 United hero Mark Robins, his team far superior, is denied. Ten Hag’s team begin to slip again, losing a ludicrous game to Chelsea with two goals scored past the 100-minute mark by the boyhood United fan Cole Palmer. United’s walk-on role in the title race is to hold Liverpool to a 2-2 draw that all but ends hopes of Jürgen Klopp’s send-off ending with the title, despite his team having 28 shots on André Onana’s goal.</p> <h2>May</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>6 May, Crystal Palace (a), 4-0 defeat; 12 May, Arsenal (h), 1-0 defeat; 15 May, Newcastle (h) 3-2 win; 19 May, Brighton (a) 2-0 win; 25 May, Manchester City, FA Cup final, 2-1 win</em></p></li> </ul> <p>With Champions League qualification a long-surrendered possibility, it all comes down to the FA Cup final. The wide expectation is City will complete the Double and Ten Hag will be sacked. The opposite happens as United outplay City at Wembley, Alejandro Garnacho and Mainoo, two teenagers, score the goals. Ten Hag, not universally unpopular among fans despite everything, survives for now, his striker-less tactics delivering his best moment in English football. Ratcliffe, meanwhile, bans United staff from working from home, telling them to seek “alternative employment” if they are not willing to come to club premises. A snag: there is not enough space in Manchester or the club’s London premises to accommodate them all.</p> <h2>June</h2> <p>Ten Hag’s future is still undecided. Names such as Thomas Tuchel are aired as possible replacements. On 11 June, it is announced Ten Hag will remain in his position, Ratcliffe having ended his review of the season by concluding that the incumbent should continue on. The news comes as a particular surprise to Ten Hag himself. “The club management came to me while I was on holiday in Ibiza,” he says in a Dutch TV appearance. “They suddenly showed up on my doorstep and told me they wanted to continue with me.”</p>    <h2>July</h2> <p>Transfer dealings commence, with Mason Greenwood sold to Marseille for £26.7m. The arrival of Joshua Zirkzee, a forward from Bologna, starts the incomings, and the capture of the teenager defender Leny Yoro from Lille for £52m beats Real Madrid to the punch. “Two high‑potential assets for the future,” says Ten Hag. Yoro is almost immediately sidelined for three months with a broken foot in a US tour friendly against Arsenal. Rasmus Højlund will also miss the start of the season with a new hamstring problem. On the US tour, the former striker Ruud van Nistelrooy takes the eye as the new assistant manager. Back home, Ratcliffe cuts 250 jobs at United, causing shock and tears from some employees, saving the club about £10m a year.</p> <h2>August</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>16 Aug, Fulham (h), 1-0 win; 24 Aug, Brighton (a), 2-1 defeat</em></p></li> </ul> <p>On-field recruiting continues apace, with £60m spent on the Bayern defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui on the eve of the big kick-off. “We have to be more consistent and we want to win every competition in which we are taking part, definitely also the Premier League,” says Ten Hag. His team get off to a moribund start, though do beat Fulham with a late goal from Zirkzee. When Brighton snatch a late win the following weekend, the doubts revive. Meanwhile, the popular Scott McTominay, so often Ten Hag’s saviour, is shipped to Napoli while Manuel Ugarte comes in from Paris Saint-Germain. Ashworth, now in situ after testy negotiations with Newcastle and a period gardening leave, says: “Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer.”</p> <h2>September</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>1 Sep, Liverpool (h), 3-0 defeat; 14 Sep, Southampton (a), 3-0 win; 17 Sep, Barnsley (h), Carabao Cup, 7-0 win; 21 Sep, Crystal Palace (a), 0-0 draw; 25 Sep, </em><em>Twente (h), Europa League, 1-1 draw; 29 Sep, Tottenham (h), 3-0 defeat</em></p></li> </ul> <p>Ten Hag’s tailspin continues as results flatline. Ugarte is almost immediately dropped and Ratcliffe’s suits feel the need to come out to bat for him. “Do we still believe in Erik?” says the chief executive, Omar Berrada. “Absolutely. We think Erik is the right coach for us and we’re fully backing him.” Marcus Rashford scores his first goal in 189 days as Southampton are beaten but a punchless loss at Tottenham is a nadir. Ten Hag is asked directly about being sacked. “I am not thinking about this,” he says. “We all made in the summer the decision to stay together, as an ownership, a leadership group.”</p>    <h2>October</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>3 Oct, Porto (a), Europa League, 3-3 draw; 6 Oct, Aston Villa (a), 0-0 draw; 19 Oct, Brentford (h), 2-1 win; 24 Oct, Fenerbahce (a), Europa League, 1-1 draw; 27 October, West Ham (a), 2-1 defeat; 30 Oct, Leicester (h), Carabao Cup, 5-2 win</em></p></li> </ul> <p>Ratcliffe, overseeing his Ineos boat’s failed assault on the America’s Cup, stirs the pot by saying: “I like Erik, I think he’s a very good coach but at the end of the day it’s not my call.” The end comes with a stroke of misfortune. Should West Ham have been awarded the penalty Jarrod Bowen struck home? Very possibly not. Would it have made a difference? Very possibly not. “Unfair and unjust,” says Ten Hag of the penalty decision but by Monday lunchtime on 28 October he is a former United manager, the victim of his team’s lack of direction. “We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future,” says a club statement. Another victim of Ratcliffe’s trusty axe: Sir Alex Ferguson, relieved of his £2m-per-year ambassador’s role.</p> <h2>November</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>3 Nov, Chelsea (h), 1-1 draw; 7 Nov, P</em><em>aok (h), Europa League, 2-0 win; 10 Nov, Leicester (h), 3-0 win; 24 Nov, Ipswich (a) 1-1 draw; 28 Nov, Bod</em><em>ø/Glimt (h), Europa League, 3-2 win</em></p></li> </ul> <p>Van Nistelrooy takes on the caretaker role many had predicted would be his and ends his stint unbeaten, a nostalgia trip into happier days. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim, 39, the youngest manager since Matt Busby in 1945, is tempted from Sporting. He reveals he originally wanted to take over at Old Trafford at the end of the season. Instead, 11 November will be his arrival date. When it comes, Van Nistelrooy is immediately shown the door and lands the Leicester job. Amorim’s tenure begins with a second-minute Rashford goal at Ipswich but there the engine sputters, the 3-4-3 formation unfamiliar to his new players. “We risk a little bit, we suffer a little bit and in the next year we will be better,” he says.</p> <h2>December</h2> <ul> <li><p><em>1 Dec, Everton (h), 4-0 win; 4 Dec, Arsenal (a), 2-0 defeat; 7 Dec, Nottingham Forest (h), 3-2 defeat; 12 Dec, Viktoria Plzen (a), Europa League, 2-1 win; 15 Dec, Manchester City (a), 2-1 win; 19 Dec, Tottenham (a), Carabao Cup, 4-3 defeat; 22 Dec, Bournemouth (h), 3-0 defeat; 26 December, Wolves (a), 2-0 defeat; 30 Dec, Newcastle (h), 2-0 defeat</em></p></li> </ul> <p>Perhaps the darkest hour comes before the dawn but the new manager bounce becomes a thud of reality, as six games are lost in December, the worst run since 1930, a season United were relegated. The spectre of the drop begins to be voiced by Amorim as the year concludes with Newcastle’s 2-0 win at Old Trafford. “Our club needs a shock and we have to understand that,” Amorim says. “It is also why I speak of relegation.” The only ray of light comes from Diallo almost single-handedly snatching a derby win at City, Guardiola’s ailing team perhaps the only side as traumatised as United. Meanwhile, as United hike tickets up to £66, Ratcliffe says: “I don’t think it makes sense for a Manchester United ticket to cost less than a ticket to see Fulham.” It is also claimed he has cut £40,000 annual funding to the Association of Former Manchester United Players. Visitors to Old Trafford must contend with another infestation: mouse droppings found in a food kiosk at a ground-level corporate suite. Ashworth, meanwhile, is gone by 6 December. “We would like to thank Dan for his work and support during a transitional period,” reads the club statement. Ashworth is reported to have felt he was undermined by the ownership and excluded from what he saw as key processes, including the arrival of Amorim.</p>",

At some point, the burglar when trying to get into the mansion may have used a ladder from a nearby property.</p> <p>Virag said about eight people, including himself, were in the mansion at the time, and it was unusually windy that day: “I heard a door bang, I thought it was the storm.”</p> <p>The burglar was believed to be on the roof, said Virag, just after 5pm when two housekeepers left the home. He entered at 5.11pm, exiting 19 minutes later.</p> <p>Security footage from inside the home, said Virag, shows the burglar turning right out of the bathroom and trying to get into a bedroom, one of 13 in the home.</p> <p>He was wearing gloves and clutching a canister.</p> <p>A few minutes later the suspect is seen on the first floor and most of his haul is taken from a dressing island in one room.</p> <p>Virag said a safe containing other valuables was ignored by the burglar. He said the footage showed how meticulous the burglar was: “He takes a Rolex watch out of the box, then closes it and puts the box back.</p> <p>“He left leaving minimal marks, even though to get to the house he had to come through a construction site.”</p> <p>Virag said he thought those behind the burglary may have carried out reconnaissance beforehand, possibly posing as a potential buyer for the neighbouring mansion which is on the market: “Anyone could view that house and use it to surveil the home.”<br>Virag, who is Huang’s chief of staff, said he doubted the burglary involved any of the home’s employees and there was no evidence even suggesting that.</p> <p>CCTV puts the height of the burglar at about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches tall. Police said the suspect is a white man in his late 20s to 30s, of medium build. He was wearing a dark hoodie, cargo pants and a grey baseball cap.</p> <p>Police said the burglar escaped with £150,000 worth of Hermès crocodile Kelly handbags, £15,000 in cash, and bespoke jewellery worth £10.4m.</p> <p>Among the jewels was a Graff<strong> </strong>10.73-carat diamond ring, two butterfly diamond rings by De Beers, a Hermès 3.03-carat ring, an aquamarine ring and a “Niloticus Lumière” necklace, as well as numerous other items including pink sapphire earrings from Katherine Wang shaped like butterflies, police said.</p> <p>Police warned those trying to sell the stolen items that they were easily identifiable, and would not say if they believed the valuables could already be out of the country and for sale on the international hidden market.</p> <p>The family have offered a reward of up to £500,000 for information leading to the capture and conviction of the suspect. A second reward is on offer of 10% of the value of any items recovered.</p> <p>Avenue Road is one of Britain’s wealthiest addresses and home to scores of largely international billionaires and millionaires.</p> <p>Before the burglary, Huang posted photos of herself on Instagram, some of which showed her luxury lifestyle. The account has now been made private.</p>",

The paper also reported that military bosses had sent files to the SPA recommending murder charges against the five soldiers.</p> <p>The MoD said that eight troops were facing charges in a single case, but would not say whether or not the case related to the alleged terrorist shooting.</p> <p>The MoD originally refused to publish the information after the Times’s request, arguing it would “undermine the effectiveness of the UK military”.</p> <p>However, an internal review overturned that decision after finding there was “no acceptable justification for withholding the information now for operational reasons”.</p> <p>The MoD’s head of information rights added in their response: “When considering requests for information, [the] MoD is required to inform requesters whether it holds the information in scope of a request.</p> <p>“However, there may be occasions when complying with this obligation would be prejudicial and, in such circumstances, the [Freedom of Information] Act allows a public authority to respond by refusing to confirm or deny whether it holds the requested information.</p> <p>“I have, however, considered the position as part of this review and alongside further consultation with the subject matter experts, we have determined that in this case it would not be prejudicial to make a section 1 declaration as to whether information in scope of this request is held.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The British government’s 10-year health plan is still some months off. So is the multi-year spending review that will set the parameters around funding. But the three themes around which Labour plans to build its NHS reforms are set. Each involves a change in emphasis: from treatment to prevention, hospital to community and analogue to digital.</p> <p>As health policy is devolved, these plans apply directly only in England. Their impact, though, will be UK-wide, since the largest health system is bound to influence the others, and what happens to the NHS is so crucial to the UK government. In 2025 – Labour’s first full calendar year in office since 2009 – there is arguably no area in which the party is more urgently in need of results.</p> <p>What would a good year look like? The NHS app has 34&nbsp;million users so far, and people booking appointments, ordering prescriptions and checking results online should free up staff to do other things – contributing to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-takes-first-steps-to-fix-the-foundations-and-save-the-nhs\">2% productivity boost</a> that was promised with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/30/cash-injection-health-service-nhs-budget\">£22.6bn</a> of new funding in October’s budget. Ministers and health bosses need to ensure that the app does not add to digital exclusion. Unless analogue means of accessing services are retained, the health inequalities they have promised to tackle will be exacerbated. But an app-supported boost to efficiency looks achievable – and has the advantage over some other ideas that it can be summed up in a sentence.</p> <p>Restoring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/02/cut-nhs-waiting-lists-keir-starmer\">18-week hospital treatment target</a> was a compromise between advocates of top-down targets and those prioritising primary care. The commitment to 92% of patients waiting no longer than 18 weeks by the end of this parliament will challenge a system strained by workforce shortages and industrial action. In England, the waiting list has already topped <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn448j3z7ggo\">7.5m cases</a> (representing <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/nhs-delivery-and-workforce/pressures/nhs-backlog-data-analysis\">6.3 million patients</a>), with even more waiting in Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqlly95k5l0o#:~:text=Public%20Health%20Scotland%20said%20the,built%20up%20during%20the%20pandemic.\">Scotland</a> and Wales.</p> <h2><strong>Funding for a ‘broken’ system</strong></h2> <p>Politically, it is not hard to see why ministers felt the need to offer voters something concrete. But to the question of whether it is possible to slash waiting lists while simultaneously re-engineering the nation’s health system in the direction of preventive public health, many experts think the answer is no.</p> <p>Health has done relatively well in funding terms since Labour took over, and is expected to be among the winners in the spending review. But owing to self-imposed fiscal constraints, as well as the weak economy, spending on the NHS does not look likely to increase at anything like the rate at which it did the last&nbsp;time Labour was in power, when it <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell\">rose by an average of 5.5%</a>. This makes the kind of improvement that can be delivered by rapid investment – for example, in staff working overtime – impossible. But public awareness of the depth of the crisis could buy ministers some time, as Wes Streeting, the health secretary, appears to have calculated when he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/28/budget-will-end-neglect-of-nhs-labour-reeves-streeting-starmer\">declared&nbsp;the system “broken”</a>.</p> <p>Despite problems on the frontline and the widely recognised demographic challenge of an ageing population with high rates of chronic illness, at least there is a broad consensus on structure. Integrated care&nbsp;is the name given to the plan for 42 regional NHS bodies (which spend around two-thirds of NHS England’s <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/our-2023-24-business-plan/\">£168bn annual budget</a>) to work in partnership with councils and the voluntary sector to make local populations healthier.</p> <p>It sounds simple. But two years in and, as Lord&nbsp;Darzi noted in his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-investigation-of-the-nhs-in-england\">review</a> for ministers, there is already variation in the way that integrated care boards (ICBs) and partnerships interpret their responsibilities, including “how and at what level they should tackle population health”. What, for example, is their role in tackling social determinants of health such as bad housing?</p> <p>If overreach is one risk – with ICBs set up to fail as mini welfare states that are meant to fix everything – the bigger one is that ministers will not let go of the reins at all. It’s not hard to see why a return to centralised performance management feels like political sense for ministers fearful of voters’ judgment. Politicians know how high a value people place on hospitals. But the announcement of the 18-week target plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/14/first-edition-nhs-league-tables-wes-streeting\">league tables</a>, with rewards for successful hospitals and special measures for failing ones, runs counter to empowering local boards. Regional health bosses panicking about whichever data points will decide the fate of local hospitals will not be able to focus on building the services that the government says it wants in order to prevent people from becoming ill in the first place.</p> <h2><strong>Questions on the new model</strong></h2> <p>Whether this power grab by the centre continues may be influenced by the government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-issues-rallying-cry-to-the-nation-to-help-fix-nhs\">listening exercise</a> to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-issues-rallying-cry-to-the-nation-to-help-fix-nhs\">reshape the NHS</a>. There is a good chance that mental healthcare will benefit from growing public concern. But integrated care is unlikely to emerge as a theme of public consultation, not least because the concept remains so vague. One question that the 10-year plan will need to answer is where, and by whom, the new-model community healthcare is to be delivered: are GPs the key figures, or health visitors and district nurses? How about schools? How will strong leadership and an open culture be supported? What principles and rules will&nbsp;govern the involvement of the private sector? The rapid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/07/the-guardian-view-on-privatised-care-failures-a-service-crying-out-for-change\">advance of private-equity-backed businesses</a> into social care is something that everyone involved should be wary of.</p> <p>A recent report by Patricia Hewitt, who was one of Tony Blair’s health secretaries, concluded that local boards should be bound by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/03/nhs-england-scrap-number-national-targets-review\">no more than 10 national targets</a>, while the share of health spending on prevention should rise by 1% each year. Much now depends on whether Mr Streeting chooses the advice of Alan Milburn, another Blairite former health secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/15/alan-milburn-to-be-given-lead-role-in-labours-health-ministry\">now with a desk in Whitehall</a>, over&nbsp;that of Ms Hewitt, who chairs an ICB.</p> <p>There is no question that devolution and autonomy require courage. One risk when local organisations pursue their own priorities is that demands for equity and consistency can trump support for innovation. One person’s localism is another’s postcode lottery. Joint commissioning by the NHS and councils brings technical complications that will have to be resolved on the&nbsp;ground.</p> <p>The danger is that allowing them this freedom, along with the rest of the integration agenda, is too much at odds with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/britain-has-been-avoiding-its-biggest-problems-for-decades-now-were-paying-the-price\">centralising instincts of the British state</a>. But Mr Streeting should not allow this&nbsp;prejudice, or nostalgia for the New&nbsp;Labour years, to colour his judgment. If the health service&nbsp;is&nbsp;as broken as has been claimed, the&nbsp;government must seek solutions to fix it.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Diageo, which brews the stout at its St James’s Gate brewery in Dublin, has intensified its marketing efforts and worked with influencers over the past few years to raise Guinness’s profile.</p> <p>The apparent theft continues a spate of recent crimes in which edible delicacies have been pilfered.</p> <p>In December, a Michelin-starred chef issued a public appeal to thieves who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/02/michelin-starred-chef-pleads-with-thieves-to-return-25000-worth-of-stolen-pies#:~:text=A%20Michelin%2Dstarred%20chef%20has,of%20stock%20had%20been%20taken.\">stole his van containing 2,500 pies</a> to “do the right thing” and give them to people in need.</p> <p>Two months earlier, detectives investigating the theft of 22 tonnes of cheese from Neal’s Yard Dairy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/31/man-arrested-over-theft-of-22-tonnes-of-cheese-from-neals-yard-dairy\">arrested a 63-year-old man</a> on suspicion of fraud by false representation and handling stolen goods.</p> <p>The London cheese specialist had delivered 950 wheels of cheddar – reported to be worth up to £300,000 – to an alleged fraudster posing as a wholesale distributor for a big French retailer.</p> <p>Nor is the Great Guinness Heist of 2024 the first time that thieves have taken advantage of the busy Christmas period to scarper with thousands of pints of the ebony nectar.</p> <p>In 2007, a <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/archives/2022/1020/1330343-guinness-robbery/\">van drove into the St James’s Gate brewery</a>, where Guinness is made, and escaped with 180 kegs of Guinness, 180 kegs of Budweiser and 90 kegs of Carlsberg, the equivalent of 40,000 pints, also in the run-up to Christmas.</p> <p> • This article was amended on 31 December 2024.

Whether they be populists or hard-headed foreign-policy realists, it is clear that leaders are prepared to talk back to Trump in his language of power. Equally true is that despite the incoming White House administration’s preference to concentrate on America first domestic issues, the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and tensions with China force themselves to the forefront of Trump’s agenda and are unlikely to be solved in either his first day, week or month in office.

            "body" : "<p>Private dentists are cashing in on the scarcity of NHS treatment by hiking their charges for fillings, checkups and extractions to “eye-watering” levels, research has found.</p> <p>Patients are paying as much as £775 for root canal work, £435 to have a tooth out and £325 for a white filling due to fees for common dental procedures soaring since 2022.</p> <p>Fees for many treatments have undergone inflation-busting rises in the last two years as more people have been forced to seek non-NHS care, with the average cost of a non-surgical extraction going up by 32%, a comparison of prices at private dental surgeries across the UK has found.</p> <p>Patient groups warned that some people with dental problems were missing out on care altogether because NHS help is so hard to access and private treatment has become so expensive.</p> <p>“For patients struggling to access NHS dental care, and for those who choose to go private, the dramatic rise in private dental costs places essential care out of reach for many,” said Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association.</p> <p>“This creates a dangerous cycle where patients bounce between an inaccessible NHS system and unaffordable private care, while their oral health deteriorates. The stark reality is that many are left with no viable route to essential dental treatment.”</p> <p>Prices have risen dramatically over the last two years, with patients now paying between 14% and 32% more for the same treatments than in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.mytribeinsurance.co.uk/knowledge/best-private-health-insurance-uk?utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=21889641071&amp;utm_content=175777540208&amp;utm_term=health%20insurance%20reviews&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAsaS7BhDPARIsAAX5cSAZ6qb2u3Soywj59j2Z02IcFJtukrChbrRV90jSRQiFFmXU5tIhyxsaAlctEALw_wcB\">according to research MyTribe Insurance</a>, which tracks the cost of private health insurance and also different types of paid-for health care across the UK.</p> <p>Their analysis of data covering six common treatments, from 450 private dental practices in 52 UK towns and cities, found that the average cost of:</p> <ul> <li><p>A white filling has gone from £105 to £129 – up 23%.</p></li> <li><p>An extraction has risen from £105 to £139 – 32% more.</p></li> <li><p>A half-hour scale and polish is now £75, up from £65 – a 15% jump.</p></li> <li><p>An initial consultation for a new patient is up 23% from £65 to £80.</p></li> </ul> <p>In addition, a routine checkup has gone from £48 to £55 – a 15% rise – while the average cost of anterior root canal treatment has increased by 14%, from £350 to £400. However, many surgeries charge much more, MyTribe found. For example, root canal work can cost anywhere between £366 in Northern Ireland and £775 in the east Midlands.</p> <p>To have a tooth out, you can pay £435 in the east of England, and £350 in the south-east and south-west. And for a white filling in the east of England you have to fork out £325.</p> <p>“Given these big recent price rises, some of the prices now being charged for private dental treatment are eye-watering and beyond the budgets of many, many people who need help with their dental health,” said Power.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.healthwatch.co.uk/blog/2024-03-18/cost-living-remains-barrier-health-most-vulnerable\">One in five people</a>, and two in five of those on lower incomes, already avoid going to the dentist in England because it costs too much, according to a survey by Healthwatch, the statutory patient champion. The recent increases in private treatment costs are “alarming”, it said.</p> <p>Louise Ansari, Healthwatch’s chief executive, said the research on private treatment costs “paints a troubling picture of access to dental care if you don’t have the financial means”, especially given the previous government’s failed efforts to incentive dentists to see new NHS patients.</p> <p>There are significant variations in the amounts charged by private dentists across the four home nations. For example, the most expensive white filling in the UK this year cost £198.90 in Watford – but just 17 miles away in Luton you could get one for £70.</p> <p>Milton Keynes is another of the dearest places to get treated. An extraction there costs £242 – whereas it’s just £75.93 in Dundee, while a checkup costs £70 in the former and only £33 in the latter.</p> <p>Similarly, the three priciest root canal treatments were in Cambridge (£660), Watford (£609) and Bournemouth (£550), while the cheapest were in Aberdeen (£250), Bangor (£250) and Belfast (£250).</p> <p>“Our research clearly shows the increasing financial burden the public feels to access dental care. It’s concerning, as NHS dental services are in crisis and people need an affordable and accessible alternative,” said Chris Steele, MyTribe’s founder.</p> <p>“I recommend that people shop around when looking for a dentist. Most publish their prices on their websites and time spent comparing them upfront can save you a lot of money in the long run.”</p> <p>He also advised patients to look closely at the cost of more complex procedures, such as extractions and root canals, as they often have the biggest price differentials; to consider joining a practice’s membership scheme, which can involve discounts; and to pay for dental cover if you take out private medical insurance, so you can claim back some of the costs of dental care.</p> <p>Eddie Crouch, the chair of the British Dental Association, which represents dentists, said “huge inflationary pressures” on dental practices, including the cost of energy and laboratory bills, and increased costs stemming from the budget, helped explain the price hikes.</p> <p>But private practices also charge higher prices to help cover the cost of treating NHS patients, as the fees they receive do not cover the outlay involved, he said.</p> <p>“Private practices have an option to reflect cost increases in their prices. NHS charges are fixed but a generation of poor funding means many treatments are now being delivered at a financial loss,” Crouch added. “Private dentistry has effectively cross-subsidised loss-making NHS care.”</p> <p>Dentists claim they have been doing more and more private work in recent years since the fees they receive for providing NHS-funded treatment have not kept up with rising costs.</p> <p>Responding to MyTribe’s research, Neil Carmichael, the executive chair of the Association of Dental Groups, said the widespread shortage of dentists was also pushing prices up.</p> <p>“This is the classic outcome from having huge demand with limited supply,” he said. “The ADG has been flagging for some time that overall dentistry requires a further 3,000 or more dentists across the NHS and private sectors.</p> <p>“This huge gap means that access to all dentistry is reduced. So, with the continued demand from patients and as overhead costs increase, it is inevitable that there is an upward pressure on prices.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “NHS dentistry is broken after years of neglect and has failed patients and staff for too long.<br><br>“This government is committed to rebuilding NHS dentistry, but it will take time. We will start with an extra 700,000 urgent appointments to help those who need it most, and reform the dental contract to encourage more dentists to offer NHS services to patients.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 January 2025 to add a comment from the Department of Health and Social Care.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The inability of millions of patients to access an NHS dentist is one of the longest-running injustices in the history of the health service. The misery and the harm it causes is profound and well documented. The scandal is not new.</p> <p>Going private is often the only alternative. If it means getting a checkup, a scale and polish, a filling, an extraction or if necessary a root canal, many will pay. Anything to keep your teeth in good nick.</p> <p>But now a new horror is emerging. Just like NHS dental care, private dental care risks becoming more inaccessible too. Fees for private treatments are rocketing, an analysis shows. Average costs of non-surgical treatments are up by as much as 32% in two years.</p> <p>Patients can be billed £325 for a white filling, £435 to have a tooth out and in some cases £775 for root canal work. It means millions more people could face a double blow in 2025: inability to access NHS dental care and inability to afford to go private.</p> <p>Of course, many of those denied NHS dental care have not been able to afford to go private for some time. One in five people, and two in five of those on lower incomes, already avoid going to the dentist in England because it costs too much, according to a recent survey by Healthwatch.</p> <p>Some go years without care, or live in agony with untreated pain. Some even attempt DIY dentistry. The dramatic rise in the cost of going private could put more Britons in the same peril.</p> <p>Fundamental changes to NHS dentistry are needed urgently to improve access and avoid people having to choose between living with poor oral health or going into debt to pay for private care.</p> <p>Surveys show a majority of adults want the ability to register permanently with a local NHS dentist in the same way that they can with a GP surgery. This right was removed in 2006.</p> <p>Most experts also believe that the current contract between the government and dentists in England is failing and should be ripped up.</p> <p>The British Dental Association (BDA), which represents dentists, says some of its members have raised private fees to compensate for the loss they are making on NHS patients. The money dentists receive from the government for NHS care is not enough to make ends meet and does not cover their costs, it suggests.</p> <p>Inflationary pressures, including rising energy and equipment costs, may also help to explain the rise in private fees, the BDA says. It wants a new contract that rewards dentists who help prevent dental problems in the first place.</p> <p>A recruitment crisis also means there are fewer NHS dentists to see patients despite a growing population. There were 483 fewer dentists doing NHS work in England last year compared with 2019-20.</p> <p>The previous government’s plan to broaden access to NHS dental care failed spectacularly. The National Audit Office said two key elements had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/27/plans-to-end-nhs-dental-care-crisis-not-working-warns-spending-watchdog\">not been achieved</a>.</p> <p>None of the promised new fleet of mobile dental vans appeared, and £20,000 “golden hellos” to entice hundreds of dentists to work in areas of acute shortage produced just one extra practitioner.</p> <p>The Labour government says it has inherited a dental sector suffering from years of neglect and insists turning it around is a priority.</p> <p>Ministers have vowed to create 700,000 extra urgent dentist appointments and reform the dental contract to make NHS work more appealing to dentists. But they have yet to set out how or when they will deliver change.</p> <p>“This government is committed to rebuilding dentistry, but it will take time,” Stephen Kinnock, the dentistry minister, said in November. The clock is ticking.</p>",

A fundamental principle is to retain the revising role of the upper chamber. To that end, it needs great expertise. It should, of course, be largely elected, but that would not necessarily ensure that expertise. It should also not be too large and should have continuity. </p> <p>So here is what I suggest should happen: each parliamentary constituency should be joined with an adjacent one, and those 300-plus each elect one member. These would constitute three-quarters of the upper house. They would have their places for 15&nbsp;years, with elections of one-third every five years, the initial and second thirds to be decided by lot.</p> <p>The final quarter of the chamber, so just over 100, would be appointed by a committee of the previously appointed members, each also to be appointed for 15 years, with similar transitional arrangements, and the first set to be appointed by the current independent lords. The given proportions of these would be selected from various areas, such as sciences, arts, teaching, former top civil servants, etc. And I couldn’t care less what the members of the upper chamber are called.<br><strong>Venetia Caine</strong><br><em>Glastonbury, Somerset</em></p> <p>• Your editorial outlined just how undemocratic and easily abused the House of Lords is, even if the proposed changes were to be enacted. I suggest we abolish it and turn it into a considerably smaller, proportionately elected senate with&nbsp;equal powers to the lower house to represent our Celtic nations and English super-regions within a new “devo max” federal&nbsp;architecture. </p> <p>This could be part of a modern written constitution to sweep away our antiquated and overcentralised status quo. Keir Starmer, wrongly, lays the blame for our ineffective performance as a country on our civil service, when in reality it is our 19th-century governing structures that hold us back.</p> <p>A commission of experts in social, political and economic sciences chaired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/10/danny-dorling-on-hunger-heating-and-hope-britain-has-the-worst-stunted-health-in-all-of-europe\">Prof Danny Dorling </a>could be tasked to work out the detail. The brief would be to look at effective elements of systems elsewhere; appropriate checks and balances at all levels to pluralise power; how to generate strong participatory communities; proportional representation at all levels, including the lower house; a federal president separate from the executive to chair the senate and consensually modify the constitution when needed, alongside a constitutional court. This role could leave the monarch with a purely ceremonial function and hopefully allow a future seamless transition to a republic. </p> <p>All these structures and functions could also accommodate an organic, bottom-up, widespread use of citizens’ assemblies/sortition for important issues. It is crucial to resurrect genuine localism and grassroots participation.<br><strong>Philip Wood</strong><br><em>Kidlington, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>• There is no need to start from scratch to determine what is required to reform the Lords. In 2007, the School of Public Policy at University College London set up an all-party group of senior politicians to analyse the issue. Its <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/sites/constitution-unit/files/119_0.pdf\">comprehensive report</a> considered the constitutional difficulties, including the key relationship between the two houses of parliament, and proposed practical solutions. The report even includes a draft bill, all in 53 pages. I have always been puzzled why this key document languishes on the shelf instead of being accepted by all concerned. Why reinvent the wheel?<br><strong>Michael Meadowcroft</strong><br><em>Leeds</em></p> <p>• Your editorial is right to criticise the timidity of Labour’s plans for changes to the House of Lords. There is no good reason, as you suggest, that we cannot be given an appropriate parliamentary title without being described as lords. Nor should any new peers be appointed for life. It is a source of frustration that the writing on the wall for hereditary members was not just in Labour’s 2024 manifesto but also in that of 1997. </p> <p>Prior to Labour’s victory that year, I worked with Pat McFadden as joint secretaries of the Lib-Lab commission planning for constitutional reform in the event of a Tory defeat in that election. Much was agreed and delivered, including devolution to Scotland and Wales, with elections on a proportional basis. But major long-term failures of Tony Blair’s government related to making the Lords more democratic and holding a referendum on electing MPs by proportional representation. </p> <p>I suggested that a referendum could have covered both reforms. With Blair’s support, such a referendum would have been won and the country would be in a much better place today, without much of the agony of the last quarter of a century.<br><strong>Chris Rennard</strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat, House of Lords</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

If this goes ahead, we can only lament the shortsightedness of the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson. The programme has allowed students in state schools to read Latin in key stages 3 and 4, and prepare for GCSEs in the subject, giving them the same opportunities as students in private schools.</p> <p>Latin has provided English with a large chunk of its vocabulary and helps to understand the grammar. Latin developed into the Romance languages and can help in learning French, Spanish and Italian. Latin and Greek are behind medical vocabulary, and biological names of species are in Latin. The Romans, who wrote and spoke in Latin, gave Britain straight roads, toilets and city walls. Latin literature is the basis of western literary culture, and Roman law is reflected in our legislation. Latin also supports rhetoric and logical thinking.</p> <p>The cost of the whole programme is only £4m, and the change would take place in the middle of the school year. This derails students’ education. A classics degree at a Russell Group university is highly regarded by City firms and other respected employers. Is the government saying that the state pupils do not deserve wide, ambitious education and these professional opportunities?

            "body" : "<p>Johnnie Walker, who has died aged 79, began his career as a disc jockey in the offshore pirate radio era of the mid-1960s. He was one of four pirate DJs – the others were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/27/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\">John Peel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/22/tony-blackburn-veteran-radio-dj-interview\">Tony Blackburn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/kenny-everett\">Kenny Everett</a> – who came to symbolise that time and continued to prosper in its aftermath. </p> <p>The pirate radio stations, of which the most famous was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/16/features.musicmonthly51\">Radio Caroline</a>, were set up on ships and disused forts in the North Sea, avoiding British regulation by broadcasting from international waters and providing pop music to a British teen market not catered for by the BBC stations of the era. </p> <p>Their DJs offered a fantasy version of adolescence from clued-up older-brother substitutes who, in the case of Peel, Blackburn and Walker, were former public schoolboys. Within this dreamscape Walker’s persona was that of the smooth-talking kid who got the girl. His theme tune was Duane Eddy’s 1960 American hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKm2_67xtVs\">Because They’re Young</a>, which more than 40 years later was still being reworked into the intro to Walker’s Radio 2 drivetime slot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/16/letters-johnnie-walker-obituary\">Letters: Johnnie Walker obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pirates went on air in the dying months of Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/oct/10/obituaries\">Alec Douglas-Home</a>’s Conservative government, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>’s succeeding Labour administration devoted an extraordinary amount of energy to suppressing this sound of youth. The Marine Offences Act of 1967 brought an end to prosecution-free pirate radio on 14 August, but Walker could still be heard proclaiming the cause of freedom and the unreasonableness of adults from Radio Caroline the next day.</p> <p>Peel, Everett and Blackburn were among the DJs who abandoned the rusting boats off the coast for a comfortable billet at BBC Broadcasting House in Langham Place, London, where Radio 1 was launched that September to meet the demand that the pirate stations had identified. The illegal broadcasting had confirmed Walker’s place in teenage affections, but by the spring of 1968 Caroline too had buckled under the pressure to stop broadcasting, and a year later Walker decamped to Radio 1, taking over its lunchtime slot.</p> <p>Walker was born Peter Dingley in Hampton-in-Arden near Birmingham, the fourth of five children of Trevor Dingley, a salesman for W Canning &amp; Co, an electroplating company, and his wife, Mary (nee Waters). At Solihull school, Peter failed his O-levels because, he claimed, he did not want a piece of paper to determine his path in life. So, at 16, he became a car salesman while moonlighting as a dance hall DJ under the name “Peter Dee”.</p> <p>In May 1966 he joined Swinging Radio England, on a ship off the coast of Essex, and changed his name to Johnnie Walker. A couple of months later he switched to Radio Caroline, the first, and the most fashionable, of the pirates.</p> <p>Walker was a radio natural, laconic but warm, and somebody who clearly cared about the music he was playing. His taste was for the adult oriented rock that dominated the pre-punk 1970s – or at least its album charts – bands such as Fleetwood Mac, Steely Dan and Steve Harley’s Cockney Rebel.</p>    <p>At BBC Radio 1, this brought him into conflict with a management that had become enamoured with Top 20-dominated playlists. The Bay City Rollers, in those ancient times the teenybopper rage, were, Walker suggested, “musical garbage”. He told callers put out by his views to “take a running jump”. Thus, by 1976 he had quit the station to seek his fortune in California.</p> <p>He did not really find it, and after spells with the stations KSAN in San Francisco and WHFS in Bethesda, Maryland, he returned to Britain in the early 1980s. He worked for local commercial stations until 1987, when he rejoined Radio 1. He then went to the BBC’s Greater London Radio from 1988 until 1990, when he was sacked for suggesting that the ousting of the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\">Margaret Thatcher</a>, would have people “dancing in the streets”.</p> <p>Despite that setback, his career in the 1990s, with Radio 1, LBC and Classic Gold was a success. In 1998 he joined Radio 2, which by then was playing the very same music he had been promoting three decades earlier when it was young and supposedly fresh.</p> <p>In 1999 the progress of his revitalised career was disrupted when he became the subject of a classic News of the World undercover sting. Walker was videoed taking cocaine and offering to provide the “tycoons” – NoW reporters – with the services of sex workers. He was suspended by the BBC, went into drug rehabilitation and after being fined £2,000 for possession of cocaine was reinstated at Radio 2. The NoW’s work had made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/14/gerardseenan\">difficult, the magistrate observed, for him to receive a fair trial</a>.</p>    <p>In 2003 Walker took absence from his show for cancer treatment, from which he made a good recovery. In 2009 he began presenting the show that would define his later career, Sounds of the 70s. </p> <p>He was appointed MBE in 2006, and in 2013 he received the gold badge of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. His eponymous autobiography was published in 2007. In 2008-09 he was an adviser to the Richard Curtis film The Boat That Rocked, an attempt to recapture the pirate radio era.</p> <p>Walker announced in early October that he was retiring from radio after 58 years, having been diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and presented his final Sounds of the 70s show at the end of that month.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Tiggy (nee Jarvis), whom he married in 2003, and by the son and daughter of his first marriage, to Frances Kum, which ended in divorce. </p> <p>• Johnnie Walker (Peter Waters Dingley), radio presenter,&nbsp;born 30 March 1945; died 31 December 2024</p>",

And for the first time since being convicted in 1996 for murdering Jose and Kitty<strong> </strong>Menendez, they had a meaningful shot at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/erik-lyle-menendez-brothers-resentencting\">freedom</a>.</p> <p>The Los Angeles district attorney, George Gascón, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/menendez-brothers-parent-killings\">announced</a> in October that he was recommending the pair be resentenced – pointing to their young ages at the time of the murders, the abuse they suffered and their behavior in prison. The decision opened the door to the possibility of their release. Everything seemed to be lining up for Erik and Lyle, who have behind bars for most of their lives, and family members were hopeful they might be home for the holidays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/menendez-brothers-family\">Menendez brothers’ family plead for their release: ‘They deserve a chance to heal’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the November election, which saw Gascón ousted and replaced by the former federal prosecutor Nathan Hochman, brought more uncertainty as to what the future holds for the brothers. Gavin Newsom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>’s governor, said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/gavin-newsom-lyle-erik-menendez-clemency\">postpone</a> a clemency decision until the incoming district attorney had a chance to review the case. Days later, a Los Angeles judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/menendez-brothers-sexual-abuse-evidence\">moved a hearing</a> on their possible release until the end of January to allow the “new administration to go through the documents”.</p> <p>Hochman has not said whether he agreed with Gascón’s decision but has been highly critical of his predecessor, and said this month that he would review each brother’s case individually to determine if resentencing is appropriate.</p>    <p>Now Bryan Freedman, an attorney who represents a group of 24 Menendez family members who support the brothers’ release, is <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/menendez-brothers-attorney-petition-case-transferred-california-generals-office/15717563/\">publicly accusing Hochman</a> of having a conflict of interest in the case, and saying he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/31/menendez-brothers-lawyer-petition-transfer\">plans to petition</a> to move the case to the California attorney general’s office.</p> <p>Freedman argues Hochman’s hiring of Kathleen Cady, an attorney who previously represented Milton Andersen, Kitty Menendez’s brother, as a member of his staff presents a conflict in Hochman’s review of the case, <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/menendez-brothers-attorney-petition-case-transferred-california-generals-office/15717563/\">ABC7 News reported</a>. Andersen opposes the brothers’ release. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Hochman’s office said in a statement that the conflict of interest claim was “<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-menendez-brothers-prosecutor-slams-meritless-conflict-claim-push-take-case-out-los-angeles\">meritless</a>”, and criticized Freedman for raising the issue in media outlets rather than talking directly to the district attorney’s office.</p> <p>“All Menendez victim family members who want the opportunity to personally speak with the district attorney before any final decisions are made have been invited to do so and these discussions should be completed in the coming weeks,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“We will look at each case separately, which is the way they actually should be handled,” Hochman had<strong> </strong>told <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/exclusive-new-l-a-district-attorney-weighs-in-on-menendez-case-227220549927\">NBC News.</a> “We will look at each victim separately, which again is what the law actually demands us to do in reaching the ultimate decision for a resentencing.”</p> <p>Hochman said he had thousands of confidential prison files to read though and would speak to “everybody who has ever touched the Menendez case in the DA’s office”.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>The violent killings of Jose, a former executive at RCA Records, and Kitty in August 1989 at the hands of their children almost immediately captivated the US. Lyle, 21, and Erik, 18, attacked their parents with shotguns as they watched television and ate ice-cream in their Beverly Hills home. Jose was shot five times in the back of the head, while Kitty was shot nine times, including as she crawled away.</p> <p>The brothers initially said that intruders had broken in and killed their parents, but eventually confessed, saying that they had killed their parents in self-defense. They said they feared their parents were going to kill them to prevent the disclosure of their father’s long-term sexual abuse – several members of their family corroborated their accounts of abuse in court.</p> <p>Prosecutors, however, argued that they were cold-blooded killers who brutally gunned down their parents to receive a multimillion-dollar inheritance. They were tried twice, and testimony about their abuse was limited in the second trial, after which a jury <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/us/menendez-brothers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.html\">sentenced</a> them to two consecutive life terms each.</p> <p>The case continued to fascinate and has been the subject of numerous documentaries. But in recent years, a more sympathetic view of the brothers emerged due in part to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/12/menendez-brothers-renewed-interest\">viral TikTok videos</a> focusing on the abuse they faced.</p>    <p>Attention intensified in the last year and a half, particularly due to two major developments – a recently surfaced letter written by Erik before the killings that corroborated his allegations of abuse, and testimony by a former member of the band Menudo who said he was abused by Jose Menendez. The brothers filed a habeas petition in response to the new evidence in 2023 challenging their convictions as unconstitutional, but there was no movement until this year.</p> <p>After the Netflix series by Ryan Murphy (which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/sep/26/menendez-monsters-netflix-ryan-murphy\">described</a> by the family as a “grotesque shockadrama”) and the documentary, calls began pouring into the Los Angeles district attorney’s office. The series was powerful for Erik and Lyle, said <a href=\"https://westcoasttriallawyers.com/our-attorneys/neama-rahmani/\">Neama Rahmani</a>, a former federal prosecutor who has followed the case.</p> <p>“With the Netflix series, all the media attention, people are talking about it on social media,” he said. “All the sudden there’s a lot of public support for Erik and Lyle, support they never had.”</p> <p>In October of this year, Gascón said his office would review new evidence – the letter from Erik and the allegations by the band member – and decide whether the brothers, now 54 and 56, should be considered for resentencing or a new trial. A request for resentencing can only be initiated by a judge or the prosecutor, not the defense, Rahmani said.</p> <p>A large group of relatives publicly called for their release, and said they had been abused and vilified.</p>    <p>“It became clear that their actions – while tragic – were the desperate response of two boys trying to survive the unspeakable cruelty of their father,” said Joan Andersen VanderMolen, Kitty Menendez’s sister, at a news conference in October.</p> <p>When Gascón announced his decision weeks later, he said he believed the brothers were “subjected to a tremendous amount of dysfunction in the home, and molestation”.</p> <p>“They have been in prison for nearly 35 years. I believe that they have paid their debt to society.”</p> <p>While in prison, they have earned college degrees and served as mentors and caregivers, he said. Family members of the brothers hailed the decision. “This decision is not just a legal matter – it is a recognition of the abuse my cousins endured,” said Karen VanderMolen, a cousin of the brothers and Kitty’s niece.</p> <p>***</p> <p>But it’s unclear where 2025 will take the case. Hochman, Los Angeles’s new district attorney, was critical of the timing of Gascón’s announcement, days before the election, and suggested it was a political move that put a “cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision”.</p> <p>The new district attorney has not yet publicly taken a position on whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. Over the next few weeks Hochman will read through all the evidence as well as family interviews and trial transcripts, among other items, he said. The resentencing hearing will take place on 30 and 31 January.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/19/la-district-attorney-gascon\">LA’s outgoing district attorney on the Menendez brothers and prison reform: ‘people could be safely released’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The precedent of whatever we do in this case will apply to future cases with requests for resentencing. We have to be consistent,” Hochman told NBC.</p> <p>Family members who support the brothers have expressed concern about Hochman, pointing out that he has not yet spoken to them and instead met with the only family member opposed to their release. “We had hopes for a fair review. It is not to be,” Tammi Menendez, Erik’s wife, <a href=\"https://x.com/TammiMenendez1/status/1868144235859599852\">said</a>.</p> <p>Hochman’s recommendation would be crucial, Rahmani said.</p> <p>The case will have political implications for the state’s governor, who will have the final say even if a judge and the parole board decide Erik and Lyle should be released. “He is the decision-maker here. We know that Newsom is looking to run in four years so this is going to be a big political issue,” Rahmani said.</p> <p>Still, the brothers have more reason to hope than ever before.</p> <p>“This was a great year for the brothers. They went from having no chance of being released to having a good chance if Gascón were re-elected to still having a chance now that Hochman defeated Gascón,” said Rahmani.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The veteran BBC DJ Johnnie Walker has died at the age of 79, it has been announced.</p> <p>Walker, who hosted<em> </em>Radio 2’s Sounds of the 70s and<em> </em>the Radio 2 Rock Show, began his career as a pirate DJ in the 60s on the offshore station Swinging Radio England, then Radio Caroline, before joining Radio 1 in 1969. He left the station after causing controversy by describing the Bay City Rollers as “musical garbage” and clashing with his bosses over an insistence on playing album tracks.</p> <p>After a period broadcasting in California, he returned to the UK in the early 80s and rejoined Radio 1 in 1987 to present a Saturday afternoon show, The Stereo Sequence, as well as working on other stations including Radio 5 (now 5 Live), before joining Radio 2, eventually taking on the Drivetime slot.</p> <p>Walker’s death was announced on air by his friend and colleague, Radio 2’s Bob Harris, who took over presenting Sounds of the 70s in November.</p> <p>Walker’s wife, Tiggy, said: “I couldn’t be more proud of Johnnie – how he kept broadcasting almost to the end and with what dignity and grace he coped with his debilitating lung disease. He remained his charming, humorous self to the end, what a strong, amazing man. It has been a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.</p> <p>“And if I may say – what a day to go. He’ll be celebrating New Year’s Eve with a stash of great musicians in heaven. One year on from his last live show. God bless that extraordinary husband of mine, who is now in a place of peace.”</p> <p>In June 2003, Walker announced to the nation that he was taking time off to be treated for cancer, eventually beating his diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the colon. He returned nine months later and won the Gold award at the Sonys. In 2006 he was awarded an MBE in the Queen’s new year honours list.</p> <p>In 2020, Walker began broadcasting his shows from his Dorset home as a result of being diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an inflammation of the lungs.</p> <p>Announcing his death on air after playing David Bowie’s Golden Years, Harris said: “I’ve known Johnnie since the 1960s when I first started listening to him on pirate radio and we know what an incredible, wonderful, superb broadcaster he was.</p> <p>“We also know how passionate he was about his music, went out on a limb many times to defend the music that he loved, and he was passionate about radio, and as the 60s moved into the 70s he and I became increasingly close friends, a friendship that endured right up to the present day.”</p> <p>Harris said he and Walker had supported each other through their health difficulties. “Johnnie and I were exchanging texts through the time after I took over the show, he wished me well at the beginning of the first programme that I did. ‘Sending you lots of love,’ he said, ‘relax and enjoy, the listeners are lovely, and they’ll look after you, all the very best from Johnnie.’”</p> <p>The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, said: “We are deeply saddened by the news of Johnnie’s passing and our thoughts are with his family and friends, as well as everyone at Radio 2.</p> <p>“Johnnie was a pop radio pioneer and a champion of great music, entertaining millions of beloved listeners on the BBC across decades, most recently hosting two shows on Radio 2. No one loved the audience as much as Johnnie and we loved him back.”</p> <p>In June 2024, Walker and his wife talked about having been informed by doctors that the condition was terminal. On their podcast, Walker and Walker: Johnnie and Tiggy, Tiggy said her husband had been told by a consultant to “prepare to go at any moment”.</p> <p>“[Tiggy] very lovingly helps me get into bed and gives me a nice kiss goodnight, and then she has to wonder whether I’m still going to be alive in the morning. Which must be pretty hard for her,” Walker said.</p> <p>Shaun Keaveny, who took over presenting Radio 2’s Rock Show from Walker, said in a message to Harris’s show: “Johnnie Walker, a rebel, a soul-searcher and a seeker, a rocker and a phenomenal broadcaster. He absolutely lived life to the limit, it was a total privilege to have worked with him.”</p> <p>Walker was born in Birmingham and left school at 15 to train to become a mechanic, later taking a job as a car salesperson.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Teenage girls are outdrinking their male peers in the UK at a greater rate than in any other European country, according to research.</p> <p>More than a third of 15-year-old girls in the UK report getting repeatedly drunk, compared with less than a quarter of boys the same age, the <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/health-at-a-glance-europe-2024_b3704e14-en.html\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (OECD) found.</p> <p>While higher proportions of girls in Denmark, Hungary and Italy admitted regular drunkenness than those in the UK, their rates were much closer to those of boys. For example, in Denmark 43% of girls admitted to getting drunk repeatedly, compared with 46% of boys.</p> <p>It is unclear why British girls appear more susceptible than boys to getting drunk regularly, but it could be connected to marketing and trends among adults.</p> <p>British women have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/07/uk-women-top-list-of-worlds-biggest-female-binge-drinkers-report-finds\">highest rate of binge drinking in the world</a>, with more than a quarter consuming at least six alcoholic drinks in a single session at least once a month. British men are still much more likely than women to binge drink, with 45% having a boozy night at least once a month.</p> <p>Dr Anna Symonds, a clinical psychologist who works with young people, said she thought anxiety and low mood could be a factor in the findings. Britain scored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/29/uk-teenagers-low-life-satisfaction-europe\">lowest for life satisfaction</a> among teenagers in Europe in research published last year, with girls particularly affected.</p> <p>This “happiness recession” could be having an effect on teenage drinking habits, according to Symonds. She said it was possible there was a link “between girls experiencing higher levels of anxiety and social anxiety and using alcohol that way”.</p> <p>She added: “Perhaps they’re using it to manage their emotions and their psychological functioning at the loss of any other strategies … People drink when they feel low to help themselves feel better. Of course, alcohol is a depressant, but teens don’t know that.”</p> <p>The research relied on participants to be honest about whether they got drunk or not. British boys may still have indulged in binge drinking but pretended in the survey that they had a higher tolerance for alcohol.</p> <p>Prof Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, told the Times: “Higher rates of drinking among girls is a real cause for concern, especially given the recent upturn in alcohol-related liver disease that we have seen among women. Although it is unclear what exactly is driving this trend, shifting cultural norms and shrewdly targeted marketing campaigns are likely to play a role.”</p> <p>The OECD noted a general downward trend in adolescent alcohol consumption but said it was still an issue. On average, 23% of 15-year-old boys across Europe reported repeated drunkenness in the latest data from 2022, down from 39% in 2002. Among girls the rate fell from 30% to 23%.</p> <p>The OECD said: “Repeated drunkenness, defined as being drunk on at least two occasions during their lifetime, continues to be common among adolescents in Europe … Early drinking initiation and getting drunk repeatedly among adolescents are of concern since these behaviours can have serious negative health, education and social consequences.”</p> <p>Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive of Alcohol Change UK, said the research highlighted an “urgent need for change” and said alcohol marketing needed to be better controlled.</p> <p>“Women in particular have been heavily targeted by alcohol companies in recent years to drink more alcohol. This creates an environment which glamorises and normalises alcohol, pretending that it is essential to our day-to-day lives,” he said.</p> <p>“What’s more, we should be supporting children to enjoy an alcohol-free childhood as recommended by the chief medical officers. That means having proper controls in place, including sensible limits on alcohol marketing, so that children and young people are not constantly exposed to alcohol marketing, especially online, on TV and at sporting events.”</p>",

The 26-year-old defender will be out of contract in the summer, and is free under regulations to sign a pre-contract deal for next season from New Year’s Day.</p> \n<p>Madrid have long been linked as his eventual destination but an attempt to pre-empt that process has fallen flat, with Liverpool rejecting the move.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/31/why-did-it-come-to-this-with-salah-van-dijk-and-alexander-arnold-contracts\">Why did it come to this with Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold contracts at Liverpool?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Madrid’s approach for Alexander-Arnold was rebuffed before any financial package for buying out the remainder of his contract could be offered. </p> \n<p>Liverpool’s executives continue to be in negotiation with Alexander-Arnold’s advisers and family, with little indication, public or otherwise, that he would like to leave his boyhood club.</p> \n<p>The Alexander-Arnold situation continues to be without a long-term solution, while the club are also still to reach agreements to extend the contracts of Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. If Liverpool’s desire is to keep all three, then finances, profitability and sustainability regulations and wage structure may be issues.</p> \n<p>Last summer, Liverpool made only one senior addition to the squad Arne Slot inherited from Jürgen Klopp; the Italian Federico Chiesa, who has struggled with injuries. Selling Alexander-Arnold in January would release funds as it represents “pure profit” for a former youth-team player but that avenue has been rejected.</p> \n<p>Madrid’s intention is for the England international to be an immediate replacement for veteran right-back Dani Carvajal, 32, who is set to miss the rest of the season with a cruciate knee ligament injury. While Salah and Van Dijk have spoken on the record about ongoing negotiations, Alexander-Arnold is yet to speak in public on the situation.</p> \n<p>At the weekend, Slot distanced himself from the negotiations with the trio, the manager saying: “I think I have a lot of control over what they do if they are on the training pitch or in a meeting with me. But if you’re talking about their private life I don’t have control. I have control over what I expect from them on the pitch and I’m really pleased to see what Trent, Mo and Virgil bring on the pitch.”</p> \n<p>Alexander-Arnold was a mainstay in the Klopp era, and was a Premier League title winner in 2019-20, having lifted the Champions League the previous year. With Liverpool currently running away at the top of the league, Alexander-Arnold, should he move on, sign off from the club he joined as a six-year-old with a second title.</p> \n<p>On the social media platform X, the former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher wrote: “The most important thing for @LFC in 2025 is winning the <a href=\"https://x.com/hashtag/PremierLeague?src=hashtag_click\">#PremierLeague</a> No one’s contract or future should come in the way of that! I love Trent as a lad &amp; a player, but his team would’ve told Real Madrid to bid &amp; also would’ve known LFC would turn it down. It’s to try &amp; cover themselves when he leaves for free. Again it’s something the club/fans don’t need with a huge game coming up.”</p> \n<p>Michael Owen, the former Anfield striker who left Liverpool for Real, posted on X: “The very fact that Real Madrid have now made their intentions clear towards signing Trent Alexander Arnold leads me to believe that it’s only a matter of time before he signs for them. If he was going to sign a contract extension, Madrid wouldn’t have officially made their move. Secretive talks will have taken place. Huge news.”</p>",

In January, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-rule-expand-access-health-information-and-improve-prior-authorization-process\">finalized</a> a new rule to streamline prior authorizations as a way to cut costs.</p> <p>Nearly one-quarter (24%) of doctors say that prior authorization has “led to a serious adverse event for a patient in their care”, according to a <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf\">survey</a> from the American Medical Association (AMA).</p> <p>Yaver interviewed a patient with severe immunodeficiency who was denied medication because her multiple infections were bad, but not yet life-threatening – “a mind-boggling assessment”, Yaver said.</p> <p>The incoming Trump administration has signaled greater support for programs like Medicare Advantage, in which 99% of enrollees are <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/use-of-prior-authorization-in-medicare-advantage-exceeded-46-million-requests-in-2022/#:~:text=Virtually%20all%20enrollees%20in%20Medicare,nursing%20facility%20stays%2C%20and%20chemotherapy.\">required to have prior authorization</a>. That could mean more administrative burdens, more denials and hampered access to care, Yaver said.</p> <p>Medical practices report an average of 43 prior authorization requests per doctor each week, the AMA survey said. That’s why more than a third (35%) employ staff whose only job is to manage prior authorizations.</p> <p>Even so, some requests still make it to physicians.</p> <p>Bosslet usually works with patients in the hospital, but once a week he sees them in a clinic. Every other clinic day, he estimates, he has to appeal denials by insurers of prior authorizations, even after the staff submits all of the necessary paperwork.</p> <p>Recently, that meant battling with an insurer to prescribe a common asthma treatment to a patient who has relied on the medication for more than a year.</p> <p>He called the number listed on the paperwork and eventually reached a person on the other end of the line who directed Bosslet to download a form buried in the insurer’s website.</p> <p>Days after submitting it, he received notice that he hadn’t completed the form quickly enough. To appeal a second time, he had to call a new number, which eventually directed him to a fax number where he could send the new appeal – but without giving him information on what form to use or what information was needed about the prescription.</p> <p>Part of the confusion is that “prior authorization” means something different to each insurer and each plan, with different forms, questions and process for submitting.</p> <p>“It’s like you have to learn a completely new language every time you get an appeal denied,” Bosslet said.</p> <p>And all of this work needs to happen in addition to providers’ time with patients.</p> <p>“I’m trying to handle that in my clinic when I have patients scheduled,” Bosslet said, adding that the whole process seems designed to get providers to give up.</p> <p>“The system is functioning exactly as designed, to be confusing and put people in positions where they have to spend more money,” he said.</p> <p>Bosslet continued: “People are frustrated that health insurance companies make billions of dollars.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of frustration about the fact that these institutions are taking massive amounts of money out of the healthcare system and doing it at the expense of sick people.”</p> <p>The insurer, Wellcare, did not respond to press inquiries. When contacted the first time, an automatic message from Wellcare said to expect a response within 24 hours; when contacted three days later, the message instructed journalists to email a different media account.</p> <p>Bosslet sent the insurer a new form with information it requested – information that was on the original prescription. That still didn’t work.</p> <p>“I’m livid,” Bosslet said.</p> <p>The first issue with the asthma prescription arose on 4 December. As of press time, the medication still hadn’t been approved. It costs $31.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>This fall, my husband and I worked with a family law attorney to write our wills and advance directives. We attempted this 10 years ago, after our first child was born, but abandoned the project amid sleep deprivation and the overwhelm of new responsibilities. Now that we are the parents of two no-longer-little kids, and more accustomed to the many losses and logistics of adulthood, we decided it was time to see it through.</p> <p>During a two-hour meeting with our lawyer, he asked questions regarding end-of-life scenarios: if you were to both pass away, who would you choose to raise your children if they are minors? Who do you choose to manage the assets left in trust for the children until they are old enough to manage assets themselves?</p> <p>While these are standard questions for writing a will, they sent me into an existential spiral. Suddenly, I was considering my past and future. What does it mean to build a life? What do I want to leave behind?</p> <p>Since 5 November, I’ve been thinking about inheritance as I come to terms with the political reality of the United States.</p> <p>In my writing career, I’ve <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/like-a-mother-a-feminist-journey-through-the-science-and-culture-of-pregnancy-angela-garbes/7323780?ean=9780062662958\">argued</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/essential-labor-mothering-as-social-change-angela-garbes/17364605\">advocated</a> for universal healthcare, racial equity in maternal healthcare, paid family leave, living wages for professional domestic workers and wages for housework <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/06/21/1105849291/essential-labor-angela-garbes-child-care-pandemic-mothering\">done for free by mothers</a>. I’ve been <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/program/book-tv/essential-labor/611864\">saying for years</a> that total bodily autonomy for all people may not be possible in my lifetime, but that it could be possible during my children’s lifetime.</p> <p>With the re-election of Trump, I am considering the possibility of living much of my life under a conservative political regime that will pass and uphold legislation antithetical to my beliefs: a government <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-12-16/labor-under-trump-explainer\">opposed to labor protections</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-to-expect-from-the-new-trump-administration-on-climate-and-environmental-policy\">environmental regulation</a>; a government based in <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-abortion-bans-deaths-agonies.html\">cruelty, not care</a>.</p> <p>As our attorney explained some legal maneuvering he would write into our wills to protect our kids’ inheritances from an estate tax, I wanted to say: “Actually, I am fine with taxes! I like the social safety net!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\" data-alt=\"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But I quieted myself with the excuse countless parents use to justify all manner of selfish decisions: I just want what’s best for my children.</p> <p>I’d hoped we would leave the next generation with a better world, that we could be proud of our virtues and accomplishments. Knowing it won’t happen, as well as acknowledging my own complicity in this, leaves me sad and disappointed. My legacy won’t be noble or simple, but it will be human.</p> <p>I’m careful about my personal legacy as well. At six, my younger daughter is prone to call herself “dumb”, “stupid”, “ugly” and “useless”. We’ve never once used those words to describe her, but she has absorbed them nonetheless. They pop up when she is having a hard time listening, when she senses that I am upset or frustrated by her.</p> <p>This, too, is one of her inheritances. I know the tendency to internalize negative feelings. I’ve lived so many years of my life that way, because I was never allowed to fully express sadness and anger and hurt.</p> <p>I want to change that. So I sit with her and urge her not to go down that path. I say that if she will just let me love her and be with her, she won’t have to tell herself terrible things that simply aren’t true. It works more days than it does not.</p> <p>“There is no other world. This is the only world we are in,” writes Alexander Chee in <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/04/19/on-becoming-an-american-writer/\">On Becoming an American Writer</a>, an essay that wrestles with the point of being a writer in the wake of Trump’s first election. Chee urges us to hold on to our art, our values and what matters to us, amid all the uncertainty: “This revisable country, so difficult to change, so easily changed.”</p> <p>What I do every day still matters, I tell myself, even when I don’t believe it. I believe my children should be free to be their whole selves, that it’s my job to allow them to do so and to witness them. And I believe that what is best for my children is what is best for everyone, especially the most vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>More from Angela Garbes’s Halfway there:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/may/23/no-sex-drive-intimacy-middle-age\">No sex drive and a ‘tanking libido’: how I redefined intimacy in midlife</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jul/08/middle-age-knees-injury\">First my left knee, then my right: my middle-aged body’s betrayal</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/27/perimenopause-life-changes\">Perimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peace</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Taped to my other wall is another passage from Chee’s essay, which I wrote out by hand after I read it in 2018.</p> <p>“Write to your dead ...

            "body" : "<p>In the manager-praises-own-player stakes, it is not perhaps what might be expected. “Yeah, Leo naturally is a bit of a moaner,” Mikel Arteta says, as he considers Arsenal’s New Year’s Day game at Brentford and how Leandro Trossard stands to have an impact on it.</p> <p>Everyone at Arsenal knew what Arteta means. We have all got a mate like Trossard, always grumbling and not always about the big things. It is how they are, piping up about this and that; the price of a pint, the weather, how long it takes to get something done, people’s foibles. It does not make you dislike them or love them any less.</p> <p>With Trossard, who has been in and out of Arteta’s Premier League lineup since his move from Brighton in January 2023 – 39 starts, 33 appearances as a substitute – it is tempting to imagine how he is when he is out.</p>    <p>Remember the beginning of the season? Trossard was plainly upset to have been on the bench for the first two games <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/17/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">against Wolves</a> and Aston Villa, having finished the previous campaign strongly – as a starter, ahead of Gabriel Martinelli. Now Arteta preferred Martinelli. When Trossard came on for him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/24/aston-villa-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">at Villa</a> in the 65th minute and scored almost immediately for 1-0, he did not celebrate. The subtext was clear.</p> <p>Arteta loved it. This is the kind of reaction he wants from his players and the thing to say about Trossard is that he can be unhappy when he is out of the team and still a part of the overall chemistry. His good sense of humour makes him popular. His direct nature is a positive.</p> <p>“Leo is very competitive,” Arteta says. “You have training sessions … he’s [also] always busy with the referee’s decision, and it’s because he wants to win. That’s what I love.</p> <p>“He always wants to be the best and when he’s not there [in the lineup], he’s not happy. But that’s what pushes him. That’s where when he comes in the pitch, he can make an impact because he’s got that drive, that anger which says: ‘I’m gonna show you.’”</p> <p>It is a reflection of how highly Trossard is valued at Arsenal that they refused to countenance an offer for him from the Saudi Pro League at the start of September; one that, as an aside, would have brought him eye-watering personal wealth. It is not just Trossard’s statistics, although they are fundamental; the 17 goals in all competitions last time out, the 10 league assists in his first half-season at the club.</p> <p>It is the hunger, the ability to be decisive in a number of positions. Most at home on the left wing, Trossard has also starred in a false 9 role and even as the left-sided No 8. The target for him must be greater consistency because he has it in him to hit the high notes.</p> <p>Trossard has entered a stage of great opportunity. When Arsenal took on Ipswich at the Emirates last Friday, there was a spotlight on their right flank. It was understandable as Bukayo Saka, the team’s poster-boy (with Martin Ødegaard) began a long layoff after undergoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/23/bukayo-saka-out-for-many-weeks-mikel-arteta-arsenal-injury-blow\">hamstring surgery</a>.</p> <p>Raheem Sterling is out with a knee injury, even if the damage is not as bad as was first feared, and Arteta’s move was to switch Martinelli over from the left wing. The pressure was intense. How would Martinelli do? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/28/gabriel-martinelli-fails-his-audition-as-search-begins-for-bukayo-sakas-heir\">Not so well, it turned out</a>. He struggled against compact, well-drilled opposition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/31/why-did-it-come-to-this-with-salah-van-dijk-and-alexander-arnold-contracts\">Why did it come to this with Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold contracts at Liverpool?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Trossard who made it happen. His return to the starting XI on the left had been lower profile. But when he exploded past the Ipswich defender Ben Johnson to tee up Kai Havertz, he had a statement assist and Arsenal the goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/27/arsenal-ipswich-premier-league-match-report\">that gave them a 1-0 victory</a>.</p> <p>Arsenal have become wearily familiar with teams that set up in a low block, especially at the Emirates. It is a byproduct of their progress under Arteta. They simply have to find a way through and so an attacker who can beat his man takes on huge significance. It is possible that Arteta may seek a solution to Saka’s absence in the January transfer window. Trossard intends to show that reinforcements are not needed.</p> <p>“Leo has shown a lot more consistency in the last 12 months,” Arteta says. “He’s had a lot of competition in his position. That’s it, raise the level. If he plays at that level [as he did against Ipswich] then he will play like anyone else. He has the capacity to do something special in the final third.”</p>",

Arsenal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/27/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">drew 2-2 at home against Liverpool</a> in October. The return at Anfield is scheduled for 10 May, the sides’ third-last match of the season.</p> <p>“It doesn’t depend on us,” Arteta said. “But we have to continue to be like a hammer, be there every day, every day. If someone wins all the matches then we congratulate them and go to the next season. If they don’t – and in history, it hasn’t happened – then we will be there.”</p> <p>Arsenal are third in the Champions League table, on course to qualify directly for the last 16 of the new-look competition, and in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, where they will face Newcastle. They have a home draw in the FA Cup third round against Manchester United. Arteta believes his team have grown compared to last season.</p> <p>“We’ve proved that already this season, I’m sure of that,” he said. “If this had happened last season – the number of games we’ve played with 10 men [after red cards], the injuries in the squad, for sure it would be difficult to be in the stages of the competitions we are in now.</p> <p>“So, for sure, the team has made another step. The team is evolving and adapting to new circumstances and now we have another one with more games with less players. So let’s face it.”</p> <p>Arteta said his new year resolution was to “keep everybody fit – that’s it”. He added: “It is full focus on Brentford because our minds have to be on what we have to do. Brentford are very tough, a really good team. If you see their record at home until the Saturday before last [when they lost for the first time this season against Nottingham Forest], it’s remarkable.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A hospital porter of 20 years who was sacked after refusing to wear a face mask during the Covid pandemic because it made him anxious has lost his claim for unfair dismissal and discrimination.</p> <p>The claims of Graham Fordham, who was laid off by his employer, Compass Group, after being off work for nine months, were rejected by an employment tribunal, which found the company had acted lawfully.</p> <p>During the Covid pandemic, staff in clinical settings such as Fordham, whose job as a night porter involved transporting patients and supplies, were required by the government to wear a mask.</p> <p>In March 2021, a nurse at Northwick Park hospital in Harrow, north-west London, complained that Fordham was wearing his mask below his nose, Watford employment tribunal heard.</p> <p>Fordham was spoken to by a manager, but he began to turn up to work without a mask and wearing an exemption badge.</p> <p>Fordham was called in for a meeting where he informed the managers that wearing a mask made him feel anxious and that he felt he could not breathe.</p> <p>Fordham said he was not able to wear a mask when moving patients around the wards because he “did not like things obstructing his face”. He had suffered from anxiety and depression since 2012, the tribunal was told.</p> <p>The hospital’s position was that if an employee decided not to wear a mask they would not be allowed on site. Fordham was suspended with pay so he could be referred to occupational health.</p> <p>He was invited to look at other roles within the hospital, the tribunal was told, but none were found to be suitable because they all required him to wear a mask.</p> <p>After being suspended and signed off work for nine months, the tribunal heard, it was concluded that Fordham was unlikely to return to work and he was sacked in December 2021.</p> <p>Fordham’s claims of unfair dismissal and disability discrimination were dismissed on the grounds that alternative measures to wearing a mask such as social distancing were “not possible”, the employment judge said.</p> <p>“Despite the relaxation of mask-wearing within the general population, the evidence before the tribunal was that this would not be changed within Mr Fordham’s NHS setting,” the judge said. </p> <p>“There was no suggestion that the requirement to wear a mask in clinical settings was due to end at any time. One of his key duties was to transport patients within the hospital setting. This would not only see him come into contact with the patient but also a number of other individuals.”</p> <p>Since Covid safety measures were dropped in 2023, staff in NHS England are no longer required to wear a mask in clinical settings. Healthcare charities and patient groups have called on NHS England to reintroduce the Covid-19 precautions for staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/10/covid-coronavirus-disabled-vulnerable-people\">amid fears</a> that clinically vulnerable patients and medics are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/16/nhs-uk-prepared-covid-winter-pirola-variant\">put at risk</a>. </p>",

Yet the procrastination goes on despite the assessment that decanting is the cheaper option. It would save billions. President Macron acted decisively to rebuild and restore Notre Dame. We should do the same with Westminster.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/aug/30/rats-fires-and-floods-inside-the-houses-of-parliament\">Rats, fires and floods: why Parliament is falling down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The proposals will include plans for three options: a full decant of the Palace of Westminster; a continued presence in the building for some parliamentarians, or a rolling programme of enhanced maintenance and improvement.</p> <p>A vote is expected in both houses on the plans when they are finally delivered. MPs, peers and senior parliamentary officials are bitterly divided on the best way to proceed with the extensive necessary works to the Victorian building. There have been dire warnings about the risks of falling masonry, potentially devastating floods and the danger of fire because of decades-old electrical wiring.</p> <p>Peers and MPs have raised concerns about the potential for mass deaths if a fire were to sweep the building, especially if it coincided with demonstrations or events in Parliament Square, which could impede access for emergency vehicles.</p> <p>The committee overseeing the project had said the decision should be put off until after the general election, with new cost estimates and timescales due this year. The committee was first established in 2013 by both houses.</p> <p>Lord Gardiner, who is on the restoration and renewal board, said in a written answer to peers that the restoration and renewal client board’s detailed work would come at the end of the year and would set out “costs and timescales as well as risks and mitigations for all three options”. There have been warnings that delays will exacerbate costs and dangers for parliamentarians and staff.</p> <p>Options to be considered by MPs are all likely to cost billions. The fastest – which could still take more than a decade – would be for both houses to leave the palace and relocate nearby on a temporary basis while most of the works are completed.</p> <p>The second option would mean a continued presence of the House of Commons chamber and temporary relocation of the House of Lords and other functions. The third would be a rolling programme of works likely to take many decades.</p> <p>Reports over the past decades have said the building is facing multiple crises. Asbestos is hidden throughout the palace, which complicates and prolongs any remedial works. There is a lack of effective fire compartmentalisation, meaning a far greater risk of fire spreading.</p> <p>The complex is the size of more than 1,000 houses, all sharing the same water, electric, sewage and gas system, all well beyond their natural lifespans.</p> <p>Under the building, there are approximately 250 miles of cabling, mainly electrical but also telephone, digital and broadcasting, over 11 hectares (28 acres). The building has up to seven floors in parts, more than 1,100 rooms and approximately 4,000 windows.</p> <p>The cheapest plan involving a full decant of the Palace of Westminster was estimated to cost between £7bn and £13bn. The longest was for the project to be done on a continuous basis, which the last report warned could take 76 years.</p> <p>Amid dissatisfaction with the options and costs that were proposed in 2019, in 2023 the sponsor body for the works was abolished and its functions brought back in-house, transferred to the corporate officers of the two Houses of Parliament – which means they reside with the clerk of the House of Commons and the clerk of parliaments.</p> <p>A parliament spokesperson said: “The Palace of Westminster needs extensive restoration and all three options for the work represent a significant, multibillion-pound investment in the building, supporting jobs and opportunities across the UK including for craftspeople and specialists.</p> <p>“We are on track to bring costed proposals to both houses for a decision in 2025 detailing costs, timescales, risks and benefits of the three delivery options.” </p>",

            "body" : "<p>High winds and heavy rain battering the UK have caused travel problems and the cancellation of a swathe of new year events including firework displays, charity swims, and a bathtub race that takes place in Europe’s largest natural harbour.</p> <p>The predicted strong winds led to the cancellation of displays heralding the arrival of 2025 in places including Blackpool, Newcastle’s quayside, the Isle of Wight, Bangor in north Wales and Ripon in North Yorkshire, joining the already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/30/edinburgh-cancels-new-years-eve-hogmanay-street-parties-and-fireworks-due-to-storm-warning\">cancelled Hogmanay</a> festival in Edinburgh.</p> <p>In Lowestoft, Suffolk, two firework displays scheduled for New Year’s Day were postponed until Saturday. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Newcastle city council said the cancellation of its New Year’s Eve fireworks was a tough decision but “the forecast has made it clear that continuing would pose risks to those attending, as well as our event teams working on site”.</p> <p>They added: “We understand how disappointing this news will be for both residents and visitors, including those who’ve travelled to our city.”</p> <p>The UK Met Office has a <a href=\"https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/warnings-and-advice/uk-warnings#?date=2024-12-31\">patchwork of weather warnings</a> in place for almost every part of the country until Thursday, and people are advised to check forecasts for their area.</p> <p>An amber warning for heavy rain has been put in place across parts of north-west England until 9am on New Year’s Day.</p> <p>The Met Office warning stretches from Settle in the Yorkshire Dales to Preston and down to parts of the Peak District.</p> <p>The warning states that heavy rain is “likely to lead to disruption including flooding in some locations” with a chance some places could see more than 10cm of rain.</p> <p>Steve Willington, a Met Office chief meteorologist, said: “Almost the entire UK is covered by at least one weather warning during the coming week, demonstrating that it is a complicated weather forecast at the moment.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, the most severe warning, an amber one for heavy rain in northern Scotland, was in place until 5pm on New Year’s Eve. A yellow warning for rain and snow in Moray, Orkney and Shetland was in place until 4am.</p> <p>In north-west England and Wales there is a 24-hour yellow warning for heavy rain from 6pm on New Year’s Eve.</p> <p>There is a yellow warning across Wales and southern parts of England for much of New Year’s Day, with predicted coastal winds of up to 75mph (120km/h). A yellow weather warning for strong winds was in place across Northern Ireland until 2pm on New Year’s Eve.</p> <p>North Yorkshire has been hit hard by the weather, with Ripon city council cancelling a New Year’s Eve event in the market square featuring music, dancing and fireworks. The National Trust closed the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estate on Tuesday because of high winds and heavy rain.</p> <p>On the roads, the A66 over the Pennines between Scotch Corner in North Yorkshire and the M6 at Penrith, Cumbria, was closed to “high-sided and vulnerable vehicles” – including all vans and motorcycles – because of the strong winds. National Highways <a href=\"https://x.com/HighwaysNWEST/status/1873963948506030095\">announced the restriction</a> at 5.26am on Tuesday.</p> <p>A landslide closed the A832 between Fortrose and Avoch in the Scottish Highlands on Tuesday morning and police said it would be impassable for some time.</p> <p>National Rail said the weather warnings for rain, wind and snow could affect services across the UK until Thursday and advised passengers to check before travelling.</p> <p>Several ferry services on the west coast of Scotland were disrupted or cancelled. All sailings between Douglas and Heysham were scrapped.</p> <p>Many parts of the UK remain at risk of flooding. Stefan Laeger, a flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, advised people travelling or celebrating new year to be “especially careful”. He urged people to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water, “as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car”.</p> <p>Laeger said: “Heavy and persistent rain tonight and into tomorrow means river levels are likely to be high across the north of England, Pennines and parts of the Midlands until the end of the week, with significant inland flooding possible until Thursday and minor impacts possible on Friday.”</p> <p>In Poole, Dorset, the annual New Year’s Day bathtub race, in which for 40 years people have paddled along the quay in their homemade, mostly bodged boats, was cancelled. The <a href=\"https://x.com/BCPCouncil/status/1873766996296479003\">local council said</a> the expected “severity of the swell of the water” meant rescue ribs would be unable to launch.</p> <p>The prospect of high winds and big waves led to the cancellation of New Year’s Day dips in places including Saltburn in North Yorkshire, Newport in Pembrokeshire and Lyme Regis in Dorset.</p> <p>Announcing the cancellation of the Lyme Lunge fancy dress dip because of forecast winds of 50-60mph, the town’s rotary club said: “I think you will all agree that we must put the safety of Lungers first.”</p> <p>London’s New Year’s Eve firework display on the Thames was still scheduled to go ahead, as authorities said the weather was being closely monitored.</p> <p>The biggest cancellation was Edinburgh’s Hogmanay festival, an event with music, street parties and fireworks that normally attracts about 50,000 revellers. Organisers apologised to international tourists who had travelled to the city for the festivities.</p> <p>Aditi Sahu, 35, and Neeraj Krishnan, 35, had travelled from London and planned their trip around the fireworks. Krishnan said: “We feel like we are stranded. We don’t really know what to do for new year.”</p> <p>The Scottish culture secretary, Angus Robertson, said the decision to cancel was “undoubtedly” correct. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “The organisers believe that they took the decision quite early for the reason that they wanted to be able to communicate to people who have been travelling now.”</p> <p>He said it was “hugely disappointing” but said there was still lots happening in Edinburgh on New Year’s Eve. “There will be all kinds of events, the pubs and clubs will be open. I’m truly sorry for everybody who has travelled but I think given the extent of the weather forecast – it’s really, really bad in some parts of the country – it’s not the right thing to proceed.”</p> <p>There is little sign of the UK’s weather improving. The Met Office’s Craig Snell said: “It will be a tricky couple of days and a wet and windy spell for many into the new year. We’re encouraging anyone who is planning to travel to keep up to date with the weather forecast and news from their local authorities.”</p> <p>While there will be fewer fireworks this year, the Met Office said there was at least a chance of seeing a natural display, the northern lights, in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England on New Year’s Eve. It said conditions would be mostly cloudy but there could be “transient” clear spells between 6pm and 9pm.</p>",

York, for the father and son from Felixstowe, Suffolk, was a particular favourite.</p> <p>Ashley <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0kfy79m\">told BBC Radio Suffolk</a> that his son had loved trains since the age of two.</p> <p>They had been having days out on trains for a couple of years and in 2023 Ashley worked out they must have visited about 25 English cities.</p> <p>He told his son this fact and Austin replied: “‘Well how many are there?’ I looked it up and there were 55 and he said: ‘Well, we should visit them all!’ So I thought … ‘OK, why not?’ I had a look, did some planning and thought this might be possible and then there was no going back. We got started.”</p> <p>They had to negotiate bad weather and intermittent industrial action, and Ashley said there were times when he thought they had bitten off more than they could chew. But they managed it, he said with pride.</p> <p>Incredibly, they were only once the victims of train delays. “It was the luck of the draw really, we were only significantly late on one train,” Ashley said.</p> <p>During their trip the pair also visited depots and had a go at train driver simulations.</p> <p>Ashley said the biggest thing for him was the time spent with Austin. “I spent a bit of time with my dad on the trains when I was younger so it brings back memories for me.” For his son it’s “the excitement of the adventure”.</p> <p>They also made friends with other dads and their boys who love trains, and had made plans to meet up with them in York.</p> <p>Inevitably, the challenge meant father and son spent a lot of time away from home, on trains, but Ashley said he was fortunate: “I’ve got a very patient wife who doesn’t mind.” </p> <p>“We’ve made friends along the way. It’s given us an excuse to meet up with family who live in different parts of the country and it’s great for Austin. It’s great to see his confidence grow.”</p>",

Wall Street has led the charge, helped by the boom in tech stocks which continued over the last 12 months.</p> <p>Investors in the UK stock market have enjoyed gains too – the blue-chip <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> index is on track to record a 5% rise this year, broadly in line with the European average.

            "body" : "<p>In the summer of 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic upended economies around the world, an obscure US software firm decided to diversify. MicroStrategy, whose head office is situated next to a shopping mall and metro station in Tysons Corner, Virginia, had decided the steady business of “software as a service” was not racy enough.</p> <p>Instead, it would branch out by investing up to $250m in alternative assets – “stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as bitcoin or other asset types”.</p> <p>Less than five years later, that bitcoin side hustle has gone stratospheric. MicroStrategy’s share price has swollen twentyfold, lifting its market capitalisation to almost $75bn and catapulting the stock into the Nasdaq 100 index of top technology shares.</p> <p>The audacious bet by its co-founder and chair, Michael Saylor, has made MicroStrategy a top pick with UK investors, as digital currencies and tokens were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/12/gambling-memecoins-donald-trump-hawk-tuah-girl-haliey-welch-crypto\">boosted by Donald Trump’s election victory</a>, despite worries that a sharp reversal in crypto prices could threaten its survival.</p> <p>Saylor’s strategy evolved into the world’s first “bitcoin treasury company”, with MicroStrategy pursuing a seemingly relentless approach of buying up bitcoin, funded by issuing billions of dollars of bonds and new shares. The company’s fans call this process a flywheel, in which issuing debt to buy bitcoin boosts the MSTR stock, allowing it to issue more shares to raise funds to buy more bitcoin.</p> <p>Saylor, who has compared bitcoin to Manhattan real estate in the year 1650, insists the company will pursue a long-term strategy of buying bitcoin, quarter by quarter. </p> <p>An aeronautical and astronautical engineering graduate whose dreams of becoming a pilot or astronaut were thwarted by a medical condition, Saylor told Yahoo Finance recently that he expected to always buy bitcoin at the top of the market, predicting: “It’s going to appreciate against the dollar forever.”</p> <p>Critics point out that Manhattan property offers a guaranteed rental income as well as the prospect of asset value growth. Saylor, though, uses a measure called BTC Yield, which MicroStrategy calls a key performance indicator, tracking changes in the ratio between its bitcoin holdings and the number of company shares.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Yu2GQ/2/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing price of MicroStrategy shares from 2020-2025, with latest at about $300 a share\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Yu2GQ/2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>While non-holders may look at bitcoin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/04/bitcoin-share-price-100-thousand\">$100,000 price tag</a> in December and think they’ve missed the boat, Saylor argued: “You’re getting a 90% discount from $1m a coin. I’m sure that I will be buying bitcoin at $1m a coin – probably a billion dollars a day of bitcoin at a million a coin.”</p> <p>Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, has claimed that MicroStrategy is “preying on investors” and pumping up optimism in bitcoin to drive higher volatility in its stock.</p> <p>“MicroStrategy’s stock valuation is at least double that of the bitcoin it holds. And, as a reminder, its software business has almost no value. One could even argue it has a negative value,” Lebowitz <a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/resources/blog/microstrategy-and-its-convertible-debt-scheme/\">wrote in December</a>. “Accordingly, investors who want to buy bitcoin should just buy bitcoin or the numerous bitcoin ETFs available.”</p> <p>In the third quarter of 2024, total revenues at MicroStrategy’s software business fell by 10.3% year on year, and the company’s net loss more than doubled to $340.2m.</p> <p>During November, MicroStrategy was the most-bought equity by customers at the UK investment service Interactive Investor (ii), ahead of regular favourites such as Nvidia, Tesla and Lloyds Banking Group. </p> <p>As of 31 December, MicroStrategy had spent $27.9bn acquiring a total of 446,400 bitcoins, at an average purchase price of approximately $62,428 each. Those bitcoins – equivalent to about 2% of the 21m bitcoins that can ever be produced – are now worth about $42bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1873716433919803868\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD.

MicroStrategy’s shares surged by 58% in November but have fallen by more than 20% in December.</p> <p>In October, MicroStrategy <a href=\"https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-announces-42-billion-capital-plan_10-30-2024\">announced</a> it planned to issue $21bn of equity and $21bn of fixed income debt over the next three years to fund more bitcoin purchases.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas, the company said it would ask shareholders for permission to issue billions more shares, increasing the number of its class A common stock from 330m shares to 10.33bn.</p> <p>MicroStrategy is attractive to investors who are eager to get exposure to bitcoin without owning the cryptocurrency itself. They can hold its stock through a savings account such as a Roth IRA in the US, or an Isa in the UK.</p> <p>“MicroStrategy has been a popular investment among investors with a high appetite for risk for a couple of years,” said ii’s Lee Wild, describing it as “a bitcoin proxy”. “Further interest has been piqued by significant increases in the price of bitcoin, especially in February and November this year.” </p> <p>A key part of MicroStrategy’s approach is to issue convertible bonds with low, or no, interest payments. They are structured so that investors could be repaid in the company’s shares if the price rises sharply by the time the bond matures, in effect giving bond investors exposure to bitcoin.</p> <p>In December, the company <a href=\"https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-completes-3-billion-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes-due-2029-at-0-coupon-and-55-conversion-premium_11-21-2024\">sold $3bn of convertible debt</a> which matures in 2029. Those notes pay no interest but could be converted to stock at a price of $672, 55% higher than MicroStrategy’s share price of $433 on the day the debt was sold. </p> <p>RIA Advisors’ Lebowitz said MicroStrategy’s convertible bondholders would profit if the price of its shares is higher than the conversion price when their debt matures. But if not, they only get their original money back – missing out on years of interest payments had they lent the money elsewhere.</p> <p>The worst-case scenario could be that MicroStrategy sells bitcoins to repay its $7.2bn of convertible debt as it matures, which Lebowitz said would be “very problematic if the price is much lower” than when the crypto was bought.</p> <p>He called MicroStrategy “essentially a leveraged bitcoin holding company”. “The problem with such a leveraged scheme is that the company is putting all its eggs into bitcoin,” he said. “A sharp decline in bitcoin will likely accompany the collapse of MicroStrategy. The other risk, although less likely under the Trump presidency than Biden, is if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to investigate MicroStrategy over their ‘unique’ strategy.”</p> <p>Saylor, before he took up his role as one of bitcoin’s loudest evangelists, was most famous for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/apr/02/observerbusiness.theobserver11\">losing $6bn of personal wealth</a> in a single day in 2000, when MicroStrategy was forced to restate two years of revenues and its stock promptly dropped by 62%.</p> <p>MicroStrategy is not the only company pursuing the goal of becoming a bitcoin treasury. The crypto miner RiotPlatforms announced earlier this month it had acquired more than 5,000 bitcoins at an average price of $99,669 each, funded by a $525m convertible bond, while Tesla owns 11,509 bitcoins. But Microsoft’s shareholders <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-shareholders-vote-against-bitcoin-172000696.html\">voted against</a> adding bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet this month.</p> <p>Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, has cautioned that MicroStrategy would be vulnerable to a drop in the value of bitcoin. “For now, bitcoin’s favourable price movement allows MicroStrategy to sustain a positive feedback loop: rising MSTR stock prices enable additional fundraising, which funds further bitcoin purchases, driving up bitcoin prices and stock value,” he said this month. “While effective during a bull market, this strategy’s sustainability depends heavily on continued bitcoin price appreciation.”</p> <p>While bitcoin’s loyal fans believe in holding on to their crypto during downturns, it is not yet clear whether MicroStrategy investors will take the same approach.</p>",

During her visit, Hochul met with prisoners to discuss the facility’s conditions and announced the appointment of a new permanent superintendent for the Marcy prison.</p> <p>“Today, as I stood in the room where Robert Brooks was killed, I was once again heartbroken by this unnecessary loss of life and further sickened to think of the actions of depraved individuals with no regard for human life,” Hochul said in a <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-visits-marcy-correctional-facility-demanding-answers-following-death-robert\">statement</a>.</p> <p>“The system failed Mr Brooks and I will not be satisfied until there has been significant culture change.”</p> <p>Hochul also announced the state will be expediting $400m to purchase more body and fixed cameras for facilities across the state, the expansion of a DOCCS special investigations team, an expansion of a whistleblower hotline and new partnerships with organizations to monitor facilities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/27/robert-brooks-body-camera-video-released\">Body-camera video released of beating preceding New York prisoner’s death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guards at the Marcy facility beat Brooks, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/27/robert-brooks-body-camera-video-released\">handcuffed</a> with his hands behind his back, on 9 December. Brooks died the next day at a hospital in Utica.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the state’s attorney general <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/osi/footage/robert-brooks\">released body-camera footage</a> of the beating, showing a team of correctional guards carrying a handcuffed and face-down Brooks into an examining room, and then repeatedly punching and kicking him for about 10 minutes.</p> <p>In the footage, he does not appear to threaten or resist the guards. Brooks is seen motionless on an examining table. A medical examiner determined Brooks may have died of “asphyxia due to compression of the neck”.</p> <p>Brooks’s death and the footage of his beating has led to rage and condemnation. Members of Brooks’s family reviewed the footage of the beating.</p> <p>“We will not rest until we have secured justice for Robert’s memory, and safety for the prisoners at Marcy correctional facility,” said Elizabeth Mazur, the attorney for Brooks’ family.</p> <p>The New York attorney general’s office of special investigations and the FBI are conducting investigations into Brooks’s death. In the days after Brooks’s death, Hochul <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/26/kathy-hochul-prison-attack\">ordered the DOCCS</a> to fire 14 Marcy facility staff members, including 13 guards and one nurse.</p> <p>The Marcy prison in upstate New York has been criticized in the past for its conditions and treatment of detained people.

            "body" : "<p>As investigators set to work unpicking the cause of Sunday’s devastating plane crash in South Korea, the black boxes carried on the aircraft will be of prime importance, with retrieval of data from the cockpit voice recorder under way.</p> <p>All but two of the 181 people onboard died in the disaster, with the victims aged from three to 78. The Korean airline’s chief executive, Kim E-bae, said he wanted “to bow my head and apologise”, according to a statement on the company’s website, adding it was “difficult to determine the cause of the accident”.</p> <p>Experts will hope the flight recorders offer crucial insights. Often called black boxes despite being orange in colour, these shoebox-sized electronic devices are often found at the rear of an aircraft to minimise damage in the case of a crash. However, while the devices are built to withstand extreme temperatures and underwater immersion, they are not immune to the effects of a crash.</p> <p>The devices store flight data such as speed, altitude and fuel levels, as well as voice recordings from the cockpit and other sounds including engine noise and radio transmissions. In some aircraft, both types of data are stored in the same device, while in others the data is stored in two separate devices, as appears to be the case for Jeju Air’s flight 7C2216.</p> <p>With both devices having been reported as discovered, they could provide vital clues as to how the Boeing 737-800 aircraft ended up skidding along a runway and colliding with an antenna array.</p> <p>However, reports in South Korean media suggest the flight data recorder is partially damaged, <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/12/113_389364.html\">potentially delaying its analysis</a>, with officials saying that decoding it <a href=\"https://m.koreaherald.com/article/10097476\">could take a month</a> or more. According to the Yonhap news agency, the second black box containing the cockpit voice recorder was in better condition. </p> <p>Among key questions are why the plane stopped broadcasting automated tracking data shortly before it hit the runway, why the plane’s landing gear failed to deploy as it prepared to land, and whether the crash could have been down to a bird strike, given air traffic controllers had issued a warning about just such a hazard as the plane approached the runway.</p> <p>It has already emerged that the aircraft aborted its first attempt at landing and issued a distress call before its second, while video footage suggests flaps on the wings were not deployed to slow the aircraft.</p>    <p>Flight recorders have proved crucial to solving such conundrums before: among other examples, it was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/01/air-france-crash-black-box\">retrieval of the black boxes</a> from deep beneath the waves that allowed experts to finally piece together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/29/air-france-crash-pilot-error\">what happened to Air France flight 447</a> – an Airbus A330 that crashed into the Atlantic in June 2009, killing all onboard. The final report concluded that the plane crashed after a catastrophic series of events that began with the failure of speed sensors and led to the pilots pulling the aircraft up to 37,500ft to slow it down, resulting in the aircraft stalling. </p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/12/113_389364.html\">Korea Times</a>, Joo Jong-wan, the director of aviation policy at the transport ministry, said at a briefing on Monday that the damaged flight data recorder would be transported to Gimpo airport the following day so that experts could assess the extent of the harm and determine how much data could be extracted.</p> <p>Frank E Turney, the chair of the aviation department for Capitol Technology University in the US, said that while the black boxes could be helpful in an investigation, they were only part of the puzzle.</p> <p>“The [black] box or the flight data recorder is not going to sit there and tell you this is what caused this accident. What it’s going to do, it’s going to give you all of the underlying factual data that you can use to try to assess how the accident occurred,” he said. </p> <p>“Sometimes the data that you’re getting from the flight data recorder will be very conclusive on what the cause of the accident was, but most of the time it is going to be a piece of the overall investigation, and not necessarily a slam dunk on ‘this is what caused this accident’.” </p> <p>One important point, he added, was that it was often not a single thing that caused an accident but a series of steps – known as the “accident chain” – that can include an initial problem, subsequent developments, and the response of the pilots.</p> <p>Turney said investigators would explore many other avenues to understand a crash, including the structure of the plane, whether there was a mechanical error, and factors relating to the pilots – such as whether they had had enough sleep or were adequately trained.</p> <p>“They’re going to go through all of that, and then at some point they’re going to sit down and go through all of this information to figure it out,” he said. “But the flight data recorder is usually a fairly sizeable piece of the puzzle that they use to determine the accident.”</p> <p>Aviation experts have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/final-tragedy-experts-debate-role-of-concrete-barriers-and-runway-design-in-south-korean-plane-crash\">raised safety questions</a> over the placement of a concrete embankment 250 metres beyond the end of the runway at Muan international airport, into which the plane crashed before bursting into a fireball.</p> <p>While the investigation continues, South Korea has launched an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/30/south-korea-emergency-safety-inspection-airline-operations-jeju-air-crash\">emergency safety inspection</a> of the country’s entire airline operations, including a separate check of all Boeing 737-800s. </p>",

            "body" : "<p>Yuriy Bengus, a biologist, surveyed a scene of destruction. The Zhuravli forest, on the northern edge of Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, was a blackened mess. Rooks cawed from burned pine trees and hopped between stumps. A dead bird lay in an abandoned military dugout. War was down the road. From somewhere to the north of Kharkiv came a muffled boom.</p> <p>Bengus plunged his spade into the sandy earth. “From an ecological point of view, oaks are most suitable,” he said. His assistant, Yulia Kucherevska, a 16-year-old volunteer, reached into a plastic bag, pulling out three acorns that she tossed into a shallow hole. The pair moved on to the next spot and threw in three more. Behind them a No 16 tram rattled past.</p> <p>In spring 2022 Russian troops had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/fighting-on-streets-of-kharkiv-ukraines-second-largest-city-as-west-bars-russian-banks-from-swift\">tried to seize Kharkiv</a>, home to a million people. The city’s defenders dug trenches in the forest and blocked the road – now named Invincible Street and previously called Hero of Labour Alley – with concrete blocks and tank traps. Meeting fierce resistance, the Russians pulled back.</p> <p>Ever since, the Russian army has been bombing Kharkiv, using ballistic and other missiles. The forest is near the city’s most pummelled district – Saltivka, its high-rise blocks gutted shells – and a hydropark, a park based around a body of water. On 17 September a Russian warplane hit the green site with an aerial bomb. Four firefighters tackling an existing fire were injured, with one losing an arm. The blaze swallowed up four acres of woodland, killing animals and scaring away coots on the water nearby.</p> <p>Bengus, along with a group of volunteers, is now attempting to restore the forest. Why bother, given that Russian forces might come back and with fighting continuing a mere 12 miles away? “The oaks will take 25 years to reach maturity. But I’m certain the forest will survive. I’m more optimistic now than before. Where we are standing will be Ukraine,” he said.</p>    <p>He added: “Russia has been trying to destroy us for hundreds of years, in particular our language and culture. But we always come back to life as a people and a nation. They can bomb us, of course, but I don’t think they can take over Kharkiv.” He continued: “We have a different mentality. Russians obey power. Our government listens to us.”</p> <p>The biologist’s ambitious plan is to replace the charred trees with English oaks, <em>Quercus robur, </em>which are native to Ukraine and Europe. A virulent root fungus has already wiped out many of Kharkiv’s Scots pines, causing them to shed their orange bark. “Oaks encourage biodiversity. They help mycelium growth and are good for insects and birds,” he said.</p> <p>After Bengus posted about the forest on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bengusyuri\">Facebook page</a>, he was inundated with offers of help. Children from a neighbourhood school, lycee number 23, collected 50kg of acorns. A scientist in Kyiv sent a box belonging to a pyramid-shaped oak variety. The students put the acorns in water, rejecting any that floated to the top – healthy ones will sink.</p> <p>Kucherevska, who studies at the school, visits the forest three times a week after classes before it gets dark. “It’s fun. I come here with my friends,” she said, adding: “If there’s an air raid alert my parents won’t let me go.” So far, she had buried “around 40,000 acorns”. Not all would survive, but this meant many new trees, she said.</p>    <p>She and her biology teacher, Anna Bozhko, joined a digging party earlier this week, along with Bengus and his wife, Lyudmila. Bozhko made a note of where saplings would sprout. What about the risk from bombs? “We’ve got used to it. We’ve adapted. I refuse to be terrified. Everyone is doing what they do. In our case that’s planting oaks. I believe Kharkiv has a future,” she said.</p> <p>Beyond the city, the situation is grim. Both sides build fortifications in wooded frontline areas, and use trees to conceal armoured vehicles and firing positions. In May the Russians launched a cross-border attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/under-a-drone-filled-sky-ukraine-tries-to-retake-a-town-one-house-at-a-time\">on the city of Vovchansk</a>, now a wreck, in Kharkiv oblast. They are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/kupiansk-russian-forces-ukraine\">closing in on Kupiansk</a> – seized by Russians at the start of the full-scale invasion, liberated, and in danger of being captured again. Russian airstrikes against Ukraine energy infrastructure and cities on Christmas Day left half a million people in the Kharkiv region without heating.</p> <p>Yevhen Vasylenko, the spokesperson for Kharkiv’s regional emergency department, said more than 300 forest fires had been recorded in 2024, the worst year ever. He said Russian shelling was often the cause, with the dense mining of forests adding to the problem. One fire in September <a href=\"https://babel.ua/en/texts/110531-on-september-2-half-of-the-village-of-studenok-near-izyum-city-burned-down-and-almost-all-the-residents-left-it-grim-report-about-people-who-lost-everything-overnight\">ripped through the village of Studenok</a>, near the city of Izium, burning down 236 houses and forcing 200 people to flee. It went on for a week.</p>    <p>“We can’t use helicopters to extinguish fires from the air because of the war. It’s impossible. And you can’t walk in the forest because of mines. We use sappers to put the fire out,” Vasylenko said. He added: “I don’t think anyone has experience of working in a situation when you can be shelled and attacked by drones, or can step on a mine at any time. It’s very hard.”</p> <p>The Studenok fire destroyed 4,000 acres of forest, located between Kharkiv and the war-torn Donetsk region, he said. Smoke made it difficult for people to breathe. Firefighters saved residents and – where possible – rescued rabbits, hedgehogs and turtles. Ducks and many dogs died. “The problem is Russia wants to destroy our country. They are ruining our ecosystem as well,” he said.</p> <p>After seeding new oak trees, Begnus went back to his flat in Kharkiv and collected more acorns from the local park. He pointed to trees he had planted back in the 1980s next to his high-rise block: an exotic ginkgo and a towering white fir. “The neighbours on the first floor are not happy about the fir. They complain it blots out their light,” he said. “But when it comes to nature and biodiversity, we have to do something.”</p>",

All but two of the 181 people onboard died when the plane slid down the runway at Muan international airport and burst into flames after hitting the dirt-and-concrete embankment built to house navigation equipment.</p> <p>A report by the <a href=\"https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2024/12/31/TJNGK4NVE5GUXPFT372LB4CS5E/\">Chosun Ilbo newspaper</a> on Tuesday said the airport’s operating manual, uploaded early in 2024, had noted that the raised ground was too close to the end of the runway, at 199 metres (652ft) away. Airport officials responded at the time by saying “adjustments would be considered” during future development, Chosun reported.</p> <p>The embankment was built to house a localiser, an antenna system that emits radio signals to guide aircraft toward the runway. It is essential for safe landings and needs to be placed relatively in line with the runway.</p> <p>The embankment has been a focus of attention but it is not unusual to have obstacles and hazards near the end of runways – not only navigation equipment but also major roads, warehouses, trees and often open water.</p> <p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommends a 240-metre safety area at the end of runways but only mandates a 90-metre area.</p> <p>Several other key questions remain for investigators, including why the jet touched down late on the runway at such a high speed with no landing gear deployed and no apparent use of the wing flaps, which are used to slow a plane down.</p> <p>South Korea’s director general for airport policy, Kim Hong-rak, told a news briefing that officials would “conduct an additional review of our airport safety standards”.</p> <p>The US National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday that it had sent investigators to South Korea to assist with the investigation.</p> <p>Families of the dead remained at Muan international airport on Tuesday to demand more information from authorities.</p> <p>The national police agency said it had enlisted additional officials and would use rapid DNA analysers to speed up the identification of five bodies.

The plane, powered by two CFM International 56-7B26 engines, appeared to be travelling at great speed when the pilot attempted what is known as a belly landing.</p> <p>“I can’t think of any reason for being forced to make a landing like this,” said John Nance, an aviation safety expert and former military and commercial pilot who flew 737s for Alaska Airlines.</p> <p>Jeju Air’s chief executive, Kim Yi-bae, said maintenance staff had not flagged any problems with the aircraft when it was inspected before takeoff on Sunday.</p> <p>Speaking at a televised press conference, Kim said the airline would reduce its winter services by 10-15% and strive to win back the trust of the travelling public.</p> <p>The crash poses a serious challenge to South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, who has ordered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/30/south-korea-emergency-safety-inspection-airline-operations-jeju-air-crash\">emergency safety inspection</a> of the county’s entire airline operation, while the transport ministry will inspect all 101 Boeing 737-800s in operation in the country by the end of the week.</p> <p>Choi, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/27/south-korea-constitutional-court-parliament-saga\">replaced</a> the impeached former acting president Han Duck-soo at the weekend, said the priority was to identify the remaining victims and support the passengers’ families. “Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families,” he said at a disaster management meeting.</p>    <p>Choi had immediately declared a seven-day period of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/29/south-korea-jeju-air-plane-crash-mourning\">mourning</a> and paid his respect at a memorial at the crash site. Similar memorials have been set up at other locations around the country, and flags were flying at half mast.</p> <p>Representatives from the US NTSB, the US Federal Aviation Administration and the aircraft manufacturer Boeing planned to meet in Muan on Tuesday.</p> <p>Establishing the cause of the accident could prove more complicated and time-consuming than usual, after the ministry said the plane’s damaged flight data recorder was missing key pieces, making it more difficult to extract its data. The second “black box” containing the cockpit voice recorder was in better condition, the Yonhap news agency said.</p> <p>Park Han-shin, whose brother died in the crash, said he had been told by authorities that his brother had been identified but said he had not been able to see his body.</p> <p>South Korean authorities will be under pressure to avoid a repeat of the aftermath of the Sewol ferry disaster in April 2014, in which more than 300 people died, mostly high school students. Many relatives of the victims complained it took authorities too long to identify the dead and to establish the cause of the accident.</p> <p>The bodies of four of the identified victims in Sunday’s crash have been handed over to their families, Yonhap said, citing local officials.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>She was a working-class woman who took amazing photographs for 70 years, yet she is little known precisely because, some would argue, she was a working-class woman.</p> <p>Alice Longstaff, who died in 1992, was well known in her home town of Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire but not elsewhere. Her fans hope a new book of her photographs will change that.</p> <p>“People who knew her say she was a real force of nature,” said Andrew McTominey, the heritage manager of the <a href=\"https://www.pennineheritage.org.uk/\">Hebden Bridge-based charity Pennine Heritage</a>, which holds Longstaff’s archive. “She was a brilliant photographer. She deserves to be known to the wider world.”</p>    <p>Born on a farm in 1907 in the village of Heptonstall, Longstaff was, her report shows, a good pupil but she left school at 14, apparently determined to become a photographer.</p>    <p>Most women of her age and status would have gone to work in the mills or domestic service but Longstaff managed to get an apprenticeship at Westerman’s photography studio in Hebden Bridge.</p> <p>In 1935, she took charge of West End Studios and became the go-to photographer for generations of Hebden Bridge residents getting married or needing passport photos.</p> <p>In the late 1930s, she bought a cutting-edge Rolleiflex camera, like that <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/collectors-item-lee-miller-could-fix-her-rolleiflex-camera-in-the-dark\">used by the American photographer Lee Miller</a>, this year portrayed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/15/lee-review-kate-winslet-remarkable-portrait-of-war-photographer-lee-miller-ellen-kuras\">Kate Winslet in the film Lee</a>. It allowed Longstaff to take photographs “on the go”, something she later described as “heaven”.</p> <p>After Longstaff’s death, Pennine Heritage was given her vast collection of negatives. There were tens of thousands of them, mostly her studio work.</p> <p>Researchers were also thrilled to find a wealth of “end-of-the roll” photographs that charted the people and everyday life of Hebden Bridge as well as the distinctive beauty of the town and its surrounding Calder Valley landscape.</p> <p>It is these negatives that have been restored and are being seen for the first time.</p> <p>Most of the people in the photographs are unknown, although the charity hopes local people will come forward with names as well as insights and stories.</p> <p>McTominey said the photographs showed what a remarkable photographer Longstaff was. She was a pioneer and someone who deserved to be recognised alongside better-known peers, he said.</p> <p>“She was a real character. So many people come here and say, ‘oh I was photographed by her’.”</p>    <p>• Copies of the book End of the Roll: the Photographs of Alice Longstaff<em><strong> </strong></em>can be ordered by contacting <a href=\"mailto:info@pennineheritage.org.uk\">info@pennineheritage.org.uk</a>.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When he learned that series two of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/oct/07/utopia-one-of-the-decades-most-electrifying-and-criminally-under-seen-thrillers\">Utopia</a> would be airing in July of 2014, Dennis Kelly knew the end was nigh. “I remember us going ‘summer’s terrible isn’t it?’”, the writer says. “And they were going: ‘No! Summer’s the new winter!’ … Never believe anyone when they say this shit to you.” By October, the cult Channel 4 thriller had been axed. For Kelly, who had a third series mapped out, it was “heartbreaking” to bid farewell before he had planned to. “But I’m quite stoic. I learned a long time ago not to take things personally.”</p> <p>Today, TV cancellations seem to be a weekly occurrence and this year alone has seen the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/29/kaos-review-jeff-goldblums-furiously-fun-greek-gods-drama-is-a-masterpiece#:~:text=Multi%2Dstranded%2C%20immaculately%20paced%20and,It%20flies.\">Kaos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/21/constellation-review-apple-science-fiction-series\">Constellation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/05/the-acolyte-review-star-wars-gets-a-thrilling-new-hero\">The Acolyte</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/27/my-lady-jane-review-you-know-what-tudor-dramas-are-missing-magic-animals\">My Lady Jane </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/25/dead-boy-detectives-review-this-fun-paranormal-romp-will-make-you-feel-young-again\">Dead Boy Detectives</a> bow out after just one season. But shows being cut off mid-sentence is nothing new. What made Utopia brilliant – its full throttle conspiracy paranoia, highly stylised aesthetic, dark comedy and graphic violence – also made it a challenging sell. But Kelly says that Channel 4 were all in … until they weren’t: “I never want to beat up Channel 4, not because I feel loyalty to them because I don’t, but I feel like they really gave it a go and they never pushed back on anything … If I were to criticise them, I’d say you should be able to see through how many people are watching something now to its value beyond that.”</p> <p>From what Kelly remembers, Utopia’s first series debuted to about 1.5 million viewers, dipping to 300,000 or 400,000 in the second. “They didn’t exactly say [it was the numbers] but I can’t think it’s anything else,” he says. “I kind of wish they had said that actually! It’s odd to me that people would say ‘we’re really proud of it but we think it’s done its thing’ when clearly it hasn’t finished. Because I get it, I’m a grownup. I don’t take offence … I don’t have a right to make my series: if people aren’t watching, [they] aren’t watching.”</p> <p>Kelly had been through a previous cancellation with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/05/pullingblackcomedyinthetr\">Pulling</a>, the BBC sitcom he co-wrote with Sharon Horgan, although that show was afforded an hour-long special to conclude. Utopia’s end was “bruising in a different way,” Kelly says. “Immediately you do go into a bit of a slump … Then you get to a point where you can move on. I don’t know if I’ve totally moved on, though … This is like a therapy session!” When he sensed the writing was on the wall, Kelly wasn’t tempted to wrap things up neatly. “Maybe it’s my stupid optimism,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t write a series thinking we weren’t going to get another.”</p>    <p>For Victor Fresco, leaving his series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/29/santa-clarita-diet-review-netflix-zomcom-drew-barrymore\">Santa Clarita Diet</a> on a cliffhanger was a calculated move. “We had an inkling it might not come into a fourth year,” he says of the Netflix “zomcom” that starred Drew Barrymore as a real estate agent who turns into a zombie, and Timothy Olyphant as her husband, attempting to conceal her appetite for human flesh. “We didn’t want to make it easier for them to cancel us,” says Fresco. “We thought ‘Why are we doing their work for them?’”</p> <p>Airing from 2017 to 2019, Santa Clarita Diet was a wacky, gory, high camp affair with a dedicated following. Despite Fresco’s inkling, it still “blindsided” him when, while in the edit suite for season three, his assistant producer walked in to tell him the show’s sets were being dismantled: “That’s how I heard it was definitively not coming back.’”</p> <p>Like Kelly, Fresco had been through cancellations before, on his network shows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/23/better-off-ted-cable-girl#:~:text=The%20writing%20is%20weak.,is%20really%20only%20halfway%20there.\">Better Off Ted</a> and Andy Richter Controls the Universe. But with Santa Clarita Diet being one of Netflix’s early original commissions, he was naive to the way the streaming model would pan out: “It was explained to us that you don’t have to be popular with everybody. This was one of the appeals: just find a niche audience.”</p> <p>What he came to understand was that “you really have, at best, a three-year run” unless your show is a “monster hit” like Stranger Things. This is in part down to Netflix contracts including a series of inbuilt bonuses that increase annually: “If you look closely at your deal, you’ll see that there’s a huge disincentive for them to order seasons four and five because they’re really making a big payout then.”</p>    <p>But while streamers have garnered a reputation for swift cancellations, they have also offered an afterlife to shows like Tracey Wigfield’s sitcom Great News, which found an audience on Netflix after being cancelled by NBC in 2018 after two seasons. Following an ambitious young cable TV producer as she dealt with her overbearing mother landing an internship on her news programme, it was Wigfield’s first solo project after working on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/04/30-rock-tina-fey-final-season\">30 Rock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/oct/04/the-mindy-project-mindy-kalings-quirky-irreverent-sitcom-is-an-ode-to-romance\">The Mindy Project</a>. The central mother-daughter relationship was based on Wigfield’s with her own mother Kathy, who, Wigfield jokes, took the cancellation harder than the cast and crew: “She took it as a personal affront that people didn’t like her!”</p> <p>Wigfield herself kept perspective: “If you’ve been in the business a while, you get it … People write dozens of scripts that never get shot and then the ones that do get shot, most of them don’t ever get seen. It’s such a waste.”</p>    <p>While Great News didn’t get the numbers NBC wanted, Wigfield says there are “a million reasons why shows stay on the air or don’t”. Another project of hers – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/24/saved-by-the-bell-review-self-aware-reboot-isnt-quite-smart-enough\">Peacock’s revival of Saved by the Bell</a>, also cancelled after two seasons – likely suffered because ongoing shows don’t bring in enough new streaming subscribers. In that sense, Wigfield says she can only do so much. “I’m not just writing things because I’m an artiste,” she says. “I want to make a hit! But I can only make things I think are interesting and funny and I will succeed and fail at that from project to project. The actual getting it to be Squid Game? Some of that is just out of my control. Or at least I tell myself that to not drive myself crazy.” Nonetheless, she concedes: “It’s a bummer, and I think it’s a bummer every time … But it’s also like, I’ve created this and I can create something else.”</p> <p>That’s what Abi Morgan told herself when she discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/19/tv-review-the-hour\">The Hour</a>, her acclaimed drama about a 1950s BBC current affairs show, would not be renewed. “It was such a visceral, physical, emotional relationship I had with that show that I acted quite tough in the beginning,” says Morgan, who vividly remembers receiving the bad news in 2013 on speakerphone in her car from her longtime producer Jane Featherstone. “I was sort of ‘OK, never mind. I’ll move on to something else’’. As a writer I always run away to another project anyway.”</p>    <p>But with an “incredible constellation of talent”, led by Ben Whishaw, Romola Garai and Dominic West, the show was a global hit, so its cancellation came as a shock. “There was a split within the BBC,” says Morgan. “I know Ben Stephenson [the BBC’s then head of drama] was really upset and wanted it to go forward but the commissioner at the time [Janice Hadlow] had culled a whole load of shows of which mine was one.” Having left audiences dangling – wondering if Whishaw’s dogged journalist Freddie had survived a vicious beating – Morgan had already plotted a third series moving into the 1960s: “You were going to discover that actually Freddie was a spy, that Freddie was the one who betrayed his country.” Instead, she was left in the “very weird” position of winning an Emmy seven months after the show had been cancelled: “I lost my palette. I was like ‘is this a successful show or is it not?’”</p> <p>Today she has mixed feelings. “There’s a whole load of work I wouldn’t have done if I had stayed on,” she says. “And it probably made room and budget for someone else’s show and that’s a good thing.” But there is still frustration: “It does take a lot of energy to build a show like that and when you’ve got the engine in place, I think that’s when you really want to let it run a bit. Because you just don’t know the way it’s gonna grow. And for us, there was that feeling that it would grow.” People talking to her about The Hour now, as they often do, is “slightly uncomfortable”. “It’s like someone talking about your ex who dumped you,” she says. “And I still love him but it’s OK, he’s gone on and had a nice life and I’ve had to move forward.”</p> <p>Of course, the question the creators of cancelled shows always face is whether or not they would resurrect their darlings should the opportunity arise. Wigfield is game for Great News – “Oh my god, yes! … I love money and television shows: I will take it!” – and Fresco thinks a short run of episodes or even a movie to tie up Santa Clarita Diet would be “really satisfying”. Meanwhile, Kelly has, for 10 years, refused to tell anyone how Utopia would end because “you never know”. Morgan sits somewhere in the middle on The Hour. “I’ve always said I’d love to come back,” she says. “But in some ways I guess I’ve moved on and it would be quite peculiar going back to that world. Maybe it would be a little bit like Miss Havisham, dragging everyone back to the past.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When the Gwinnett county board of elections held its monthly meeting on 20 November just outside of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/atlanta\">Atlanta</a>, the county’s election director, Zach Manifold, noticed something was different.</p> <p>For months leading up to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024\">presidential election</a>, there had been a steady stream of people who would come to speak at the board’s meetings, many of them concerned about the potential for fraud or wrongdoing. But this time around, weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s victory both in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> and in the US presidential election, fewer than a half-dozen people signed up to speak during the public comment portion of the meeting.</p> <p>“Everybody was very happy,” Manifold said. “I have not had anyone contact me with any questions really about the election.”</p> <p>Until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020 election</a>, local election officials worked in obscurity and anonymity, ensuring that the election was fairly administered and complied with state and federal laws. But ever since the president-elect’s loss in 2020, they have borne the brunt of his efforts to sow doubt about the integrity of US elections. They have faced vicious harassment campaigns, been bombarded with public records requests, and been on the frontlines combating misinformation about voting. A number <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/09/1242811437/election-voting-officials-threats-turnover\">left the profession</a> altogether.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/dec/23/did-democracy-survive-the-2024-global-election-marathon\">Did democracy survive the 2024 global election marathon?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/election-office-georgia-arizona-michigan-pennsylvania-california\">election officials</a> had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/trump-2024-election-subversion\">preparing for an intense period</a> of uncertainty after election day, concerned that, as in the 2020 election, the winner of the presidential election would be uncertain and they would face immense pressure as Trump and his allies sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/trump-2024-election-subversion-explainer\">subvert the election results</a>. But when the race was called fairly quickly for Trump, the results were widely accepted, with few questions about who won.</p> <p>“I think the age of election denialism is, for all intents and purposes, dead,” Adrian Fontes, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrat</a> who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona\">Arizona</a>’s top election official, <a href=\"https://www.kjzz.org/elections/2024-11-25/as-arizona-certifies-2024-results-officials-hope-for-the-end-of-election-denialism\">said</a> when he certified his state’s election results in late November.</p> <p>But in interviews, several local election officials said the story was more complex. While they hoped the uncontested outcome of the 2024 election would pave the way for a return to normalcy after four bruising years, they doubted it would end election denialism altogether.</p> <p>“The temperature certainly needed to be brought down, and as a result of the election, the temperature seems to have frozen,” said Barb Byrum, a Democrat who oversees elections in Ingham county in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan\">Michigan</a>.</p> <p>“I don’t think it’s the end of election denialism, but the louder conspiracy believers, their candidate won,” Byrum said. “It has been evident that when that particular group, when their candidate is victorious, they’re quiet. But that does not mean that they won’t be louder for the next election.”</p> <p>Eighty-eight per cent of voters say that the 2024 elections were administered well, a significant increase from 2020, when just 59% said so, according to a recent survey by <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/12/04/voters-evaluations-of-the-2024-election-process/\">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>    <p>Among Trump supporters, that shift was even more pronounced. After the 2020 election, just 21% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republican</a> voters said they thought the election was well run and 79% said they did not. This November, 93% of Republican voters thought the election was run well. Only 7% said they did not.</p> <p>Eighty-four per cent of Democrats said they thought the election was well-run, a 10-point drop from 2020, according to Pew.</p> <p>Indeed, after election day, Byrum spent time pushing back on conspiracy theories from some Democrats. She said that the skepticism among Democrats wasn’t equivalent to the deep skepticism from Republicans since 2020. When she responded to concerns about this election, she said, Democrats were willing to accept her explanations.</p> <p>Tammy Patrick, the chief program officer at the National Association of Election Officials, observed strains of election denial in places where there were particularly close contests. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, the state senate president, Phil Berger, a Republican, has suggested there was foul play in a state supreme court election.</p> <p>Allison Riggs, a Democrat, trailed her Republican opponent by 10,000 votes on election night but pulled ahead and won the race by a few hundred votes. Berger called it “another episode of count until someone you want to win, wins”.</p> <p>According to Patrick, “what this tells us is that it really has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the election. It has everything to do with whether or not a particular party or candidate has been victorious.”</p> <p>Paul Gronke, a political science professor at Reed College who leads a survey of local election officials across the country, said that many election officials “generally breathed a sigh of relief” when the election results were decisive.</p> <p>Still, he said there was evidence of the toll that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/election-office-security-threats\">pressure had taken on officials</a>. At a recent conference on election administration hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington DC, he said, some election officials said 2020 and 2024 were “night and day”, while others broke into tears, underscoring the tension they had been experiencing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/04/local-officials-hostility-election\">Local elected officials in US faced uptick in hostility in lead-up to 2024 election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It is good that we do not have national figures constantly questioning the validity of the outcomes and calling into question the behaviors in individual jurisdictions,” he said. But officials must still navigate “the stress related with the jobs and hours that people are saying that they’re working”.</p> <p>A survey of local election officials this year by the <a href=\"https://evic.reed.edu/\">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</a>, which Gronke leads, found that 14% of respondents said they had considered leaving their job because they were concerned about safety. And while over three-quarters of respondents said they were satisfied with their job, just 22% said they would recommend that their children go into election administration.</p> <p>Joseph Kirk, the elections supervisor in Bartow county, Georgia, said he wanted to spend the time outside of the main election season speaking to voters and educating them about the election process.</p> <p>“I’m glad things are calming down,” he said. “But if we don’t keep folks engaged, we’re going to repeat.”</p>",

He said risks in key areas were effectively addressed, while employment and prices remained steady.</p> <p>The speech followed the December meeting of the Communist party politburo, which was widely viewed as signalling the strongest commitment to economic stimulus in a decade, marking a shift towards more aggressive subsidies and cuts to the cost of borrowing.</p> <p>“The current economic operation faces some new situations, challenges from the uncertainty of the external environment and pressure of transformation from old drivers of growth into new ones, but these can be overcome through hard work,” Xi said.</p> <p>Trump is preparing to impose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/trump-mexico-canada-tariffs-border\">high tariffs on Chinese imports</a> to punish what the incoming US president believes are unfair subsidies for Chinese industrial products.</p> <p>China is expected to respond with restrictions on US companies operating inside China, including Elon Musk’s Tesla car company. Musk became a key adviser to Trump during his presidential campaign.</p> <p>Xi,<strong> </strong>ratcheting up tensions between the world’s two largest economies, said “no one can stop” unification with Taiwan and that he would not rule out the use of force to bring the island under Beijing’s control.</p> <p>Taiwan, which exports many of the most sophisticated computer chips used by US manufacturers, is a key point of contention between Beijing and Washington. The US does not officially recognise Taiwan diplomatically but is its strategic ally and largest supplier of weapons.</p> <p>China has staged three rounds of large-scale military drills since Taiwan’s leader, Lai Ching-te, came to power in May.</p> <p>“Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties, and no one can stop the historical trend of the reunification of the motherland,” said Xi.</p> <p>China’s economic policymakers have yet to announce a precise growth target for 2025, but officials have flagged that 5% will be the outcome when they meet later in January.</p> <p>A series of stimulus measures since September 2024 are likely to have kept growth from falling below 4.8% in the last year. However, economists at Bloomberg have estimated a growth rate of only 4.5% for 2025, well below the 5% expected level and significantly lower than the 6% average reached before the pandemic.</p> <p>Growth rates could be even lower than official figures suggest. The Chinese authorities have faced persistent accusations of massaging economic data to suit official forecasts, especially during the pandemic, when Beijing ordered one of the most severe lockdowns of any major economy. Many analysts said the move depressed consumer spending and business activity by more than was shown in official data.</p> <p>Senior policymakers are known to want China’s stock markets to grow at a stronger pace and more consistently to support wealth creation and private sector investment. Share prices improved in 2024 despite a dip on the last day, but the modest rise over the last year followed an unprecedented three-year decline.</p> <p>Among the stimulus measures is a boost to public sector pay. It is understood the first significant pay rise for civil servants in several years was awarded before Christmas, as policymakers try to boost morale and spur spending.</p> <p>According to a Bloomberg report, the basic salaries of many government employees were bolstered by at least 500 yuan ($68.51) a month, backdated to July.</p> <p>China’s central bank is expected to make it easier for households and businesses to borrow after a slump in the housing market caused many property firms to go bust.</p> <p>Xi also praised Russia and said the two countries would move forward “hand in hand” on the right path, months after the two countries struck a “new era strategic partnership” on key issues.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/16/vladimir-putin-xi-jinping-announce-plans-strengthen-military-ties-beijing\">Xi and Vladimir Putin agreed in May to deepen bilateral ties</a> and cooperate on areas of mutual interest such as Taiwan, Ukraine and with respect to mutual rival the US.</p> <p>Russia’s state-run RIA news agency also quoted Moscow’s ambassador to Beijing as saying last Friday that Xi would visit <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/chinas-xi-jinping-will-visit-russia-2025-russian-ambassador-says-2024-12-27/\">Russia</a> in 2025.</p>",

Elections in November saw the defeat of the progressive district attorney George Gascón, who previously said he was open to the brothers’ resentencing.</p> <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez have been in prison 35 years for the crime with no possibility of parole. They have consistently claimed they killed their parents out of fear for their lives following years of sexual abuse.</p> <p>Gascón <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/arts/menendez-brothers-district-attorney-los-angeles.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/arts/menendez-brothers-district-attorney-los-angeles.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare\">said</a> his office was evaluating whether the brothers should remain in prison for the rest of their lives and that he had a “moral and ethical obligation to review what is being presented”.</p> <p>An extraordinary push for the Menendez brothers to be freed bubbled up in the wake of a sympathetic Netflix documentary and new claims that Jose Menendez, a former RCA Records executive, had also allegedly abused Roy Rosselló, a former member of the 1980s Puerto Rican boyband Menudo. There was also the recent discovery of a letter from Erik Menendez to a cousin that was penned before the murders in which he discussed his father’s abuse.</p> <p>The incoming Los Angeles district attorney, Nathan Hochman, is an independent and may be less sympathetic to the Menendez brothers’ resentencing drive. Hochman has said that he plans to review all the evidence in the brothers’ case.</p> <p>Bryan Freedman, the lawyer representing the 24 relatives who support the brothers’ release, has accused Hochman of “playing politics” with the case.</p> <p>Freedman told <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/video/menendez-brothers-attorney-case-transferred-state-117193605\">Good Morning America</a> that Hochman should meet with the family members.</p> <p>“The family members are victims. They suffered loss. They have also seen the rehabilitation. They are the best people to talk to,” Freedman said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/31/erik-lyle-menedez-brothers-2024-resentencing\">Menendez brothers’ 2024 saw hopes of release soar but ended in uncertainty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Menendez brothers have long claimed that they acted in self-defense when they fatally shot their parents as they watched TV in August 1989. But prosecutors claimed the crimes were committed for money after the brothers went on a $700,000 spending spree in the aftermath of their parents’ deaths.</p> <p>The first trial, which had separate juries for each brother, ended in a mistrial. A second trial in 1996, which took place soon after OJ Simpson’s acquittal for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, found the brothers guilty. They were sentenced to two consecutive terms of life without parole.</p> <p>However, some of the evidence that the brothers may have been abused by their father was excluded from that trial, which is the groundwork for the resentencing push. Hochman recently told Deadline: “Erik Menendez was able to testify in great detail about all the sexual abuse he experienced. He was even able to testify about sexual abuse that Lyle experienced.”</p> <p>But Freedman, the family lawyer, rejected that claim, saying that “[there was] a number of witnesses, a number of family members, who weren’t able to testify about the abuse that they saw”.</p> <p>Hochman’s office has rejected conflict of interest that might justify moving the resentencing case from county prosecutors to state prosecutors as “meritless”.</p> <p>“All Menendez victim family members who want the opportunity to personally speak with the district attorney before any final decisions are made have been invited to do so and these discussions should be completed in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson for the district attorney told <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-menendez-brothers-prosecutor-slams-meritless-conflict-claim-push-take-case-out-los-angeles\">Fox News Digital</a>.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Israel’s pattern of sustained attacks on Gaza’s hospitals and medical workers has brought the coastal strip’s healthcare system to the brink of “total collapse”, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office.</p> <p>The report, which catalogues the besieging and targeting of hospitals and their immediate grounds with explosive weapons, the killing of hundreds of medical workers, and the destruction of critical life-saving equipment, said that in certain circumstances the attacks could “amount to war crimes”. Israel has consistently denied committing war crimes in Gaza.</p> <p>The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said the report’s findings pointed to “blatant disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law”.</p> <p>“As if the relentless bombing and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza were not enough, the one sanctuary where Palestinians should have felt safe in fact became a death trap,” Türk said in a statement.</p> <p>While the Israeli military has repeatedly sought to justify its attacks on Gaza’s hospitals, accusing armed groups including Hamas of using medical facilities as command posts, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said the evidence provided by Israel to back up its assertions had been “vague”.</p> <p>This week Israel ordered the closure of the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly in recent weeks, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/30/gaza-hospital-director-israeli-prison\">detained its injured director</a>, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, who has reportedly been interned in the notorious Sde Teiman detention camp.</p> <p>Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 45,500 Palestinians, was triggered by the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage.</p> <p>Covering the period from 12 October 2023 to 30 June 2024, the rights office said: “The situation has deteriorated to a catastrophic level since October 2023, as this already damaged health system has been targeted, resulting in the killing of hundreds of health and medical professionals.</p> <p>“The attacks on hospitals often followed a similar pattern, involving missile strikes on hospital buildings, the destruction of hospital facilities, shooting of civilians, sieges, as well as temporarily taking over hospital buildings.”</p> <p>It added: “A fundamental rule of international humanitarian law is that the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. All wounded and sick persons, including civilians and persons hors de combat, are afforded protection. Furthermore, IHL [international humanitarian law] provides specific protections to medical personnel and medical units where the wounded and sick are cared for, including hospitals.”</p> <p>It concluded: “The destruction of the healthcare system in Gaza, and the extent of killing of patients, staff and other civilians in these attacks, is a direct consequence of the disregard of international humanitarian and human rights law.”</p> <p>Noting that about 80% of Gaza’s healthcare system had been destroyed, the report said this had led to preventable deaths, including of mothers, and to newborn babies being denied care.</p> <p>Responding to claims that Israeli forces had directed sniper fire at hospitals, the report said: “Another feature of attacks on hospitals has been the apparent precision targeting, by long-barrel weapons, of people inside hospitals, including medical staff.</p> <p>“In most cases it has been difficult to determine attribution, particularly where there were reports of armed clashes in the vicinity.”</p> <p>The Israeli military did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the report. The UN said that, responding to its report, the Israeli government had said its military took extensive measures to mitigate civilian harm and minimise disruption, including the provision of aid and evacuation routes, and the setting up of field hospitals.</p> <p>Israel has in the past few days conducted operations against hospitals in Gaza that drew criticism from the head of the World Health Organization.</p> <p>The report said deliberately directing attacks against hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are would, provided they are not military objectives, be war crimes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/30/photojournalism-world-at-war-2024-women-expose-human-cost-ukraine-sudan-gaza-drc-colombia\">‘It’s not our job to make photos that are easy to look at’: the female photographers exposing the cost of conflict in 2024</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“In each operation on a hospital documented by OHCHR, after multiple strikes on structures in the vicinity, the Israeli military besieged the premises. The siege cut off access and isolated those inside, including patients, medical staff and IDPs [internally displaced people], while preventing the entry of medical supplies and other necessities of life, negatively impacting individuals’ rights to health and life,” the report said.</p> <p>“The siege of Kamal Adwan hospital in north of Gaza and al-Amal hospital in south of Gaza are two of six emblematic cases monitored and documented by OHCHR.”</p> <p>“If any of the strikes on at least 27 hospitals and 12 other medical facilities, totalling 136 strikes between 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024, were deliberately targeting civilians including doctors, nurses and medics not taking a direct part in hostilities, or civilian objects not being used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, rather than military objectives, these would amount to war crimes,” the report concluded.</p> <p>Israel has consistently rejected such claims from multiple organisations, including human rights groups.</p> <p>The report was released as Gaza health authorities said 45 patients and wounded people, accompanied by more than 100 relatives, were evacuated to receive treatment in the United Arab Emirates.</p>",

They were followed by NatWest bank, whose shares rose by 82%, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/20/ds-smith-takeover-us-rival-international-paper\">packaging firm DS Smith which gained 77% amid a takeover by a US rival</a>.</p> <p>“Air travel and holiday stocks have been flying high, with IAG and Rolls-Royce soaring to the top of the UK’s performance charts,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>“Despite facing headwinds from rising costs, consumers seem determined to prioritise pleasure over prudence, proving they’re all-in on making memories – even when the budget’s tight,” Britzman added.</p> <p>Bottom of the list was JD Sports, whose shares fell 42% this year, after the company bookended the year with profits warnings in January and November.</p> <p>Another retailer, Frasers, was ejected from the FTSE 100 this year after its valuation fell, a fate that also befell building group Vistry, online grocery Ocado and fashion firm Burberry during the year.</p> <p>America’s technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30% during 2024, rising five times faster than the FTSE 100, which contains more old economy stocks such as banks, oil companies and miners.</p> <p>The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized firms listed in London rose by 4.75% during the year.</p> <p>Most equity markets recorded gains for 2024, with both Japan’s Nikkei and Germany’s DAX rising by about 19%.</p> <p>Lori Heinel, global chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, said: “2024 was no ordinary year, with elections around the world, persistent inflation and market volatility all playing their part in building an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Despite these challenges, markets continued to be resilient.”</p> <p>MSCI’s index of global stocks rose by more than 17% during 2024, and jumped by 4.5% in November alone after Donald Trump won the US election, followed by a 2.4% drop in December.</p> <p>“The euphoria about Fed rate cuts and Trump’s pro-business policies that dominated the market theme in November soon turned into caution,” said Raffi Boyadjian, lead market analyst at XM.</p> <p>“The Fed may have slashed interest rates by a full percentage point in 2024 but the overriding message of its final policy decision of the year was that it will likely go on pause in early 2025, with traders eyeing May as the earliest possible meeting for a 25-basis-point rate cut,” Boyadjian added.</p> <p>The US dollar had a strong year, with the pound dipping by about 1.6% to end the year about $1.253. Sterling rose more than 4% against the euro, to finish about €1.2066.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>This Christmas, bailiffs have been busy. Evictions in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.propertyreporter.co.uk/worrying-trends-emerging-as-evictions-set-to-spike-before-christmas.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">rose by 11.2%</a> compared with the same period last year, leaving thousands of families without a home in the coldest months. Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/27/nearly-two-thirds-of-working-private-renters-in-england-struggle-to-pay-rent\">new research</a> has revealed that private landlords in England are charging such high rents that nearly two-thirds of workers are struggling to pay it.</p> <p>The study, commissioned by the housing charity Shelter, found that nearly 4.5 million people are falling behind on their rent or having trouble covering its rising cost. It is gloomy news for the government, which has put fixing Britain’s chronic housing-affordability crisis at the heart of its agenda, but under whose watch life for private renters continues to deteriorate.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has pledged the government will deliver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/08/labour-15m-homes-new-towns\">1.5m new homes</a> over the next five years, with many in Labour hoping more private landlords will compete to drive down prices. However, sobering <a href=\"https://institute.global/insights/economic-prosperity/the-urgent-need-to-build-more-homes\">research</a> from the Tony Blair Institute concludes that “building homes alone will not fix the UK’s housing-affordability problems”, and that even a fourfold increase in housebuilding will not provide the relief renters desperately need.</p> <p>If Britain’s private rental sector is so broken that the vast majority of tenants are already scrabbling to keep up with payments, simply expanding this rotten system will only drive more people into poverty and <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7328/#:~:text=The%20PRS%20has%20the%20worst%20housing%20conditions&amp;text=The%20English%20Housing%20Survey%20(EHS,%25%20of%20social%2Drented%20homes.\">poor living conditions</a>; 23% of dwellings in the hands of private landlords do not even meet decent homes standards. Rather than more cowboy landlords renting out crummy flats at unreasonable prices, we need a genuine alternative to compete with the private rental sector outright. We need a huge expansion of social housing.</p> <p>Limited land, capacity in the development sector and the UK’s legally binding <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carbon-budgets\">carbon budgets</a> mean that, without radically more sustainable construction practices, there’s a finite number of new homes the country can realistically build each year. Solving the housing crisis, therefore, is a question of priorities: will allowing the market to build as it pleases bring down prices most quickly, or should Britain be more strategic in specifying what kind of new homes we commission in 2025 and beyond?</p> <p>Imagine a neighbourhood with brutally high rents but space to build some new homes. Which tenure of new rented accommodation would most alleviate the dire cost of living crisis tenants are experiencing: private or social? New privately rented homes will provide shelter for families in need, and ease pressure for housing in the area. But the cost to those households will be high, in line with already onerous local rents. More people will be housed, but average housing costs in the neighbourhood will have barely changed.</p> <p>Choosing to build social-rent homes, on the other hand, will have a much bigger impact on the neighbourhood. The new flats will still provide accommodation for the same number of families in need, relieving an identical burden of pressure from local housing demand. But this time rents for the new homes will be capped in line with local incomes – social rents are often <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/investing_in_social_housing_could_add_over_50bn_to_the_economy_\">50% lower</a> than private rents – driving down the local average.</p> <p>With lower average rents, communities as a whole have more money left to spend in the local economy, fuelling greater prosperity for all. The housing crisis is primarily a humanitarian disaster, but it is also an economic millstone around the neck of Britain. The more the nation’s salaries are sucked up by high rents, the less there is for anything else. Shelter estimates that building <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6sxvmndnpn0s/5nQCiTlJiqFDyFCWkvZSYP/9700aa188cc52c49212f0b0c0af23668/Cebr_report.pdf\">90,000 new social-housing units</a> would make Britain £50bn better off. In a letter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, Shelter’s chief executive, Polly Neate, Ikea boss Peter Jelkeby and other industry leaders urged the government to build nearly a million<strong> </strong>socially rented homes over the next decade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/28/two-income-households-need-social-housing-too-heres-why\">Two-income households need social housing too. Here’s why</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The social rental sector is not just more affordable, but superior to privately renting in other ways, too.Secure tenancies, for example, allow residents to put down roots without constantly living in fear of being turfed out. While Labour has plans to clamp down on landlords imposing impossible rent hikes and no-fault eviction notices, for now private renters have a fraction of the long-term stability that social renters enjoy. And while private renters are frequently policed by landlords’ swineging rules dictating what tenants can and can’t do in their homes (even sometimes banning posters affixed to walls), social renters generally benefit from strong rights to decorate and customise their homes.</p> <p>A further reason to prioritise growing the social rental sector is the dizzying cost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/27/councils-in-england-paying-17bn-a-year-to-house-people-in-temporary-homes\">temporary accommodation</a>. Without enough council housing to go round, local authorities in England are forced to spend eye-watering sums leasing emergency accommodation at jacked-up prices for homeless families. Hastings council, for example, spent about <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/crisis-hit-councils-spend-up-to-50-percent-of-budgets-on-temporary-housing-vwsq88p50#:~:text=Hastings%20borough%20council%20in%20East,only%20%C2%A3730%2C000%20a%20year.\">half its annual budget</a> on temporary accommodation last year, while London boroughs are spending <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/london-boroughs-spending-on-temporary-accommodation-hits-4m-a-day-89013\">£4m a day</a> providing emergency shelter.</p> <p>This month, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called on the government to make the mass building of new council homes <a href=\"https://x.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1872622543854833920\">its defining purpose</a>. “No other policy, achievable within a parliament,” he declared, “would have greater social and economic benefits.” He is right. Given Britain can only build a limited number of homes each year without a <a href=\"https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5\">total revolution</a> in green architecture, the absolute priority should be expanding social housing.</p> <p>For too long we have allowed too much housing, a commodity as vital to wellbeing as water and energy, to be controlled by a predatory private rental market without robust competition or proper regulation. Decent housing should be the cornerstone of a dignified and stable life, but unchecked private landlordism has failed to provide either. After a Christmas of evictions and renters struggling to get by, Labour’s new year’s resolution must be bold. Only a new generation of genuinely affordable social homes can solve Britain’s housing crisis. It is time to get building.</p> <ul> <li><p>Phineas Harper is a writer and curator</p></li> </ul>",

The director has spent five years culling thousands of hours of footage for The Way of the Wind, which bodes well for maximum Malickican chaos.</p> <p>Other films all but guaranteed a Cannes spot come May are Orphan, from the Son of Saul director László Nemes; Jupiter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/06/leviathan-review-story-of-job\">Andrey “Leviathan” Zvyagintsev</a>’s film about the reckoning of a Russian oligarch, his first since a near fatal bout of Covid; and Die, My Love, AKA the return of Lynne Ramsay. Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattison star in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/03/repulsion-review\">a Repulsion-esque drama</a> of postpartum unravelling in rural Montana.</p> <p>Claire Denis and Lucrecia Martel will probably appear on the Croisette, too, the former with a drama starring Matt Dillon, the latter a documentary about the murder of the Indigenous Argentinian leader Javier Chocobar.</p> <p>Martel’s last film, Zama, was released more than seven years ago, as was Kathryn Bigelow’s Detroit. She has a White House thriller due out this year, while Celine Song follows up Past Lives with a romcom starring Chris Evans and Dakota Johnson.

Luca Guadagnino gave us two movies in 2024; in 2025, he is back again with After the Hunt, a thriller with Julia Roberts as a university professor with a dubious past, co-starring Andrew Garfield, Ayo Edebiri and Chloë Sevigny.

The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/19/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-5-licorice-pizza\">Licorice Pizza</a>’s Alana Haim.</p> <p>Finally, Tom Cruise may just be straddling next year’s biggest box office hit – the final Mission: Impossible – and its splashiest arthouse hot ticket. He is starring in Judy – not a quickie remake of the Judy Garland biopic, but Alejandro González Iñárritu’s drama, co starring Riz Ahmed and Sandra Hüller, about “the most powerful man in the world, who embarks on a frantic mission to prove he is humanity’s saviour before the disaster he’s unleashed destroyed everything”.

            "body" : "<p>Last week, we looked back at how 2024 made Elon Musk the world’s most powerful man. Today, we’re looking at a few other important themes that will influence the online and offline worlds in 2025.</p> <h2>Tech takes a legal beating</h2>    <p><strong>Google:</strong> Ruled an illegal monopoly in August, Google could be broken up. The results are anybody’s guess, but what seemed impossible for a company worth $2.5tn is at play. The US has asked the judge in the case for a wholesale breakup of the giant, which would force it to divest Chrome, the world’s most popular browser and one of Google’s core businesses.</p> <p><strong>TikTok:</strong> The US passed a law that will, in t-minus three weeks, either force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell its popular video app, or push it entirely dark in the US. Of the two possibilities, a ban is more likely, as ByteDance has said divestment is impossible, and Beijing has opposed a sale. As with Google, what seemed so implausible is now very possible: TikTok could be well and truly banned. Only the US supreme court now stands between TikTok and its closure. If you had told me a year ago that TikTok would disappear at the same time we published a story cheekily headlined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/31/us-tiktok-ban-federal\">How 2023 became the year Congress forgot to ban TikTok</a>, I would have laughed. TikTok has become the center of American online culture, though perhaps Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts will fill the absence.</p> <p>Social media companies likewise faced difficult legal headwinds in Australia. Read on to the next section for more on that.</p> <h2>Should kids have tech?</h2>    <p>The dual revolutions of smartphones and social media have made their way to the youngest among us. Now, as their guardians, we’re tasked with setting the boundaries for them. However, we don’t yet know where those guardrails should be.</p> <p>The wildfire-hot debate over kids and social media began in earnest in March, when psychologist and social scientist Jonathan Haidt published The Anxious Generation. Haidt attributes today’s crisis in teen mental health to social media and the loss of unstructured playtime. The book shot to the top of bestseller lists, where it remains; Haidt’s explanation has hit a nerve. I think he’s wrong; you can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/27/anxious-generation-jonathan-haidt\">read why here</a>.</p> <p>Schools across the US instituted policies that prohibit smartphone usage during the school day to varying degrees. Los Angeles’s school district, the second-largest in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/18/los-angeles-schools-cell-phone-ban\">announced its phone prohibition in June</a>. Parents fought back while simultaneously bemoaning how much time their children spend on their phones. The UK, which has banned phones from schools nationwide, looked on with perplexity.</p> <p>Australia took the most extreme step in November when it banned any child under 16 from social media, though the new law will only go into effect in a year after tests of age-gating software in the country. Much remains unknown about the law – particularly, how it will be enforced – but it is the most restrictive in the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/28/australia-passes-world-first-law-banning-under-16s-from-social-media-despite-safety-concerns\">Read more about it here.</a></p> <p>The Guardian’s series on social media’s role in the exploitation and trafficking of children has been shortlisted for a Fetisov Journalism award for outstanding contributions to civil rights.</p> <p><strong>You can read the first story in the series here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/feb/02/mother-hunt-houston-daughter-instagram-meta-sex-trafficking-grooming\">‘If Instagram didn’t exist, it wouldn’t have happened’: a mother’s search for her trafficked daughter</a></strong></p> <h2>Crypto bounces back</h2>    <p>Of any niche in tech, cryptocurrency had the worst 2023. Sam Bankman-Fried’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/02/sam-bankman-guilty-ftx-alameda\">multibillion-dollar fraud at FTX </a>became worldwide news, and crypto’s most famous man became the mascot for its worst impulses as he was convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Then the US went after Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. That company admitted to money laundering, paid a fine and lost its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. Bitcoin ended the year at a price of roughly $42,000.</p> <p>Then, like Elon Musk and AI, cryptocurrency had a great time in 2024. Bitcoin soared to $100,000. Chalk that up to the close alliance between Donald Trump and the cryptocurrency industry. He’s the first US presidential candidate to accept donations in crypto, after all, and he’s started his own cryptocurrency venture. Polymarket and Kalshi, prediction betting markets built on blockchain technology, rose to prominence as a new and influential type of political polling. Polymarket’s CEO bragged that Trump had called him from Mar-a-Lago to talk about the odds on the site and to praise it as more reliable than traditional polling, which continues to lose trust.</p> <p><strong>Listen to our podcast about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/dec/09/how-trumps-victory-sparked-a-crypto-boom-podcast\">the bromance between Trump and cryptocurrency here</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Read about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/online-betting-markets-expansion-after-presidential-election\">success of prediction betting markets like Polymarket and Kalshi</a> and how they’re planning to capitalize on it in 2025.</strong></p> <h2>AI and its chips dominate the stock market</h2>    <p>Nvidia, the maker of the chips most coveted for programming artificial intelligence, is the biggest financial winner of 2024. Its share price has tripled since the start of the year. Consider the headlines the Guardian ran in coverage of its earnings reports:</p> <p>• <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/20/nvidia-earnings-ai-chipmaker\">November</a>:</strong> Nvidia earnings: AI chip leader shows no signs of stopping mammoth growth<br>• <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-earnings-report\">August</a>:</strong> Nvidia rides big tech’s AI investment to beat Wall Street’s sky-high expectations. (There was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/29/nvidia-shares-fall-after-investors-spooked-by-slowing-growth-delays-next-generation-ai-chips\">brief but precipitous dip</a> in the share price in late August that was quickly erased.)<br>• <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/22/nvidia-quarterly-earnings\">May</a>:</strong> Nvidia reports stratospheric growth as AI boom shows no sign of stopping</p> <p>Google likewise reaped enormous benefits from the financial frenzy for AI. Even as it endured a flogging in US courts, its stock value climbed higher and higher with each announcement of each new AI thingamajig, more than doubling its share price since the start of 2024. There were multiple versions of Gemini, Google’s flagship AI assistant capable of understanding images and words as well as generating them. The model underpins Google’s AI-generated search result summaries, perhaps its most visible AI product. I would characterize the investor reaction to Google’s announcements as such: “An AI that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/16/i-ai-generated-some-podcasts-and-the-results-are-uncanny\">summarizes your notes and makes a podcast</a> out of them? How neat! Hard to see that finding a long-term use case. Regardless, here’s $50bn in market cap.” Would AI podcasting software become a $50bn company on its own? No, certainly not. But in Google’s hands, who knows? Google is likewise not known as a chipmaker, yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/09/google-unveils-mindboggling-quantum-computing-chip\">announcement this month</a> that the company had developed an AI chip in-house with improved performance and less energy consumption caused its stock to rise 12%, a $250bn growth for its market capitalization.</p> <p>A slew of other smaller companies have likewise financially drafted off the AI boom: OpenAI raised $6.5bn this year; Reddit, the beneficiary of deals for its archive of high-quality text data, debuted on the US stock market this year and saw its share price steadily rise to more than triple its starting share price; Databricks, which provides software for storing and analyzing huge amounts of data, brought in $10bn in investment; Broadcom, which makes chips and data-center software, is worth $1tn as of 13 December. Taiwan Semiconductor, an integral part of the AI supply chain, hit the same market cap milestone in October.</p> <h2>The arrest of Telegram’s CEO prompts change</h2>    <p>Pavel Durov’s arrest in August put Telegram’s lax approach to content moderation in the spotlight. The founder and CEO of the app, which boasts nearly a billion users, was detained in France and indicted on 12 charges, including “allowing criminal activity” on his app. French authorities accused him of complicity in the distribution of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking, which he denies. His case is still pending as he remains on bail in France.</p> <p>Prior to the arrest, Telegram was known for how little it policed what its users said and what they sent. Now, it’s publishing reports on how effective its moderation is. It announced it would crack down on harmful content like fraud and terrorism in September, and this month, it announced AI had enabled it to remove some 15m groups and channels dedicated to illegal behavior. The change, though confined to one corner of the internet, means that a billion people now speak to each other in quite a different landscape than before.</p> <h2>My favorite Guardian tech stories of 2024</h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/30/why-i-regret-using-23andme-i-gave-up-my-dna-just-to-find-out-im-british\">Why I regret using 23andMe: I gave up my DNA just to find out I’m British</a> </strong><br>Kari Paul gave away her genetic information to a now imploding company for results that inspired nothing but ambivalence.</p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/24/trump-taylor-swift-deepfakes-ai\">How did Donald Trump end up posting Taylor Swift deepfakes?</a> </strong><strong><br></strong>AI images posted on Truth Social bore the watermark of a tiny Texas non-profit looking to bankroll X users.</p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2024/oct/26/ai-child-sexual-abuse-images-kaylin-hayman\">A predator used her 12-year-old face to make porn.

            "body" : "<p>In early December, Emily Zobel Marshall completed her mountain leader training for the walking group Black Girls Hike: a two-night expedition in Snowdonia that involved wild camping at -6C and night-time navigation.</p> <p>Speaking just before she left, Zobel Marshall, an academic from Leeds Beckett University, insisted she was thrilled by the challenge ahead.</p> <p>“Putting up a tent at night, in driving rain and strong wind, could be seen as admirable or bonkers – but I’ll be taking my lipstick with me too, so it can’t be all bad!” she said, laughing. “But in all seriousness, we really need to get more black women leaders out there, so it has to be done.</p> <p>“Black women can face rural racism when they go walking in the countryside,” she added. “While there’s rarely the ‘You don’t belong round here’ type of direct racism any more, you’re often the only black woman and often made to feel you don’t belong in so many direct and indirect ways: being stared at, aggressively asked if you’re lost, or repeatedly asked why you’re there.</p> <p>“This is why black walking groups that specifically support black girls to feel that the outside is a safe landscape, are so important,” she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/01/black-girls-hike-rewards-of-walking-group\">Rhiane Fatinikun set up Black Girls Hike</a> (BGH) in 2019. Initially intended for a few women in her local area, the organisation now has more than 5,000 members and runs national and international walks, weekend trips and holidays. For younger people of ethnic minorities, it offers the Duke of Edinburgh award and youth walks.</p>    <p>Fatinikun recently published her first book, Finding Your Feet. In January, the group will have its own <a href=\"https://www.museum.manchester.ac.uk/wild/\">exhibition space at Manchester Museum</a> as the winter partner for its Wild exhibition, addressing institutionalised racism and its impact on access to green spaces.</p> <p>“We wanted people to understand and reflect on how white a lot of climate and environmental action groups are,” said Chloe Cousins, the museum’s social justice manager. “These action groups aren’t overtly exclusive but if you’ve got a group that’s predominantly white and is run by white people, then how welcome will black people feel?”</p> <p>Fatinikun created BGH to challenge this status quo. “I wanted to create a safe space for black women to reconnect with nature so that we could explore the countryside together free from prejudice,” she said. “I want to diversify the countryside and let other people know that it is a place for everyone to enjoy.”</p>    <p>But, she said, the group is more than that. “It is a support system, a sisterhood where we can just be,” she said. “Many of us live with the pressure of constant code-switching, often being the only one in our working lives. In the outdoors, among people who look like us, BGH provides a place to breath.”</p> <p>BGH is not the only walking group for ethnic minorities: Moja Collective, the East Midlands African Caribbean Women Walking Group, Muslim Hikers, Wanderlust Women’s Group, Ebony Hikers, Bristol Steppin Sistas and Wild in the City, are just a few of the others.</p> <p>Maxwell Ayamba, of another hiking group, Kinder in Colour, said he thinks walking groups are key to raising awareness of the “history of the countryside’s rootedness in colonialism and exclusion”.</p> <p>“With just under 1 per cent of minorities accessing the countryside, issues of inequality and accessibility remain ever present,” he said. “These problems have to do with the erasure of the historiography of the black presence in Britain which continues to be fed into prevailing narratives of English rural culture.”</p> <p>Ayamba agreed that no one stops black and people of colour from visiting the countryside. But, he said, the historical narrative of the English landscape as “white space”, “results in some form of internal control by some rural folk and other walkers which can be interpreted as racist, and which makes specific groups feel they cannot engage with such spaces”.</p> <p>Ayamba points to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/31/the-muslim-hiker-inspiring-his-community-to-hit-the-hills\">Muslim Hikers who went up Mam Tor</a> in the Peak District national park on Christmas Day in 2021, and were <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/muslim-hiking-group-vile-racists-22601503\">described</a> as a “migration of the Serengeti wildebeest”.</p> <p>Julie Cordice, a volunteer leader with BGH, agreed with the need to challenge the myth – sometimes subconsciously held – that the countryside is not for black people.</p> <p>“Whenever we have new people on our hikes, their reason for not coming out before is that they thought the countryside was where white folk lived and so they wouldn’t be welcome,” she said. “The only reason they had the courage to face this deep, embedded cultural thing was because they knew they would be in a group of other black women, all doing it together.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 January 2025. An earlier version misnamed the hiking group Moja Collective.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It was the spring of 2014 and I was at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington to interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter\">Jimmy Carter</a>. The former president had just published a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/24/jimmy-carter-call-to-action-women-girls-abuse\">book on women’s rights</a> and was keen to make his case. The abuse of women and girls was, he believed, the worst <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-rights\">human rights</a> violation of the time and he was determined to issue a global call to action on the subject.</p> <p>He argued passionately and eloquently, rolling though a litany of abuses women and girls around the world face: rape and violence in war, trafficking, infanticide and, in his own country, an epidemic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/rape\">sexual assault</a> at universities<strong>.</strong></p> <p>“This is something on which I’m going to continue to work with a very high degree of my priority for the rest of my life,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/31/jimmy-carter-hometown-georgia\">‘He chose to come back’: Jimmy Carter’s Georgia home town celebrates his life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was typical of a man who, more than any other US leader, showed that the crowning achievements of a career could come after having the most powerful job in the world rather than during it. And they were no small achievements: Carter was, by general consensus, a tireless campaigner for human rights, democracy and, perhaps most significantly, global public health.</p> <p>His Carter Foundation, set up by the former president and his wife, Rosalynn, in 1982 – a year after he left the White House – has worked for nearly four decades to eradicate the painful and debilitating Guinea worm disease. An estimated 3.5 million people in 20 countries were afflicted in 1986 when his foundation launched the campaign. Last year, 14 human cases were reported.</p> <p>Yet, even as the then 89-year-old Carter determinedly and convincingly spoke to me about his latest campaign, what stood out most was his humility and lack of ego.</p> <p>There we were in one of the US capital’s grandest hotels with Secret Service agents stationed all around, the trappings of the office he vacated 30 years before still very much visible. But as I sat down to interview him, the peanut farmer turned president was quickly finishing up a snack of, well, nuts, before standing up to greet me warmly as if the suite were his own living room.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He believed some things were more important than re-election – things like integrity, respect and compassion</p> <footer> <cite>Barack Obama</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By all accounts, that luxury suite was notably grander than his own living room: he famously moved back to the modest home in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/31/jimmy-carter-hometown-georgia\">childhood town of Plains, Georgia</a>, that he built with Rosalynn.</p> <p>“It’s where our family has always lived. It’s where we own our land, our home – the only home we’ve ever owned,” he said. “It’s where our church is, it’s where our friends are. It’s a haven for us.”</p> <p>That church, Maranatha Baptist, was where Carter taught Sunday school for more than three decades, into his 90s, attracting an international congregation not often seen in rural corners of the American south.</p> <p>“If I get home at midnight on Saturday, I still teach on Sunday morning,” Carter said.</p> <p>His undiluted devotion to Rosalynn was abundantly clear. He delighted in revealing that she was in the neighbouring half of the hotel suite as we spoke and that she had been the driving force behind his campaigning for women’s rights. Looking slightly awestruck, he insisted that Rosalynn was “probably the world champion of human rights now”. Overblown though that assessment may have been, it spoke to Carter’s commitment to his wife, to whom he was married for 77 years and whom he will be buried alongside next week at that very same family home in Plains.</p> <p>True to his younger days of working on the family farm, Carter spoke about how he rose with the sun and would be ready for action, while exhausted younger aides were still bleary-eyed. He had been in interviews since 7am on the day we met, I was told.</p> <p>Later that day, he said, Rosalynn and he were planning to meet their grandson Jason, who was standing at the time for governor of Georgia in the 2014 midterm elections. (In the event, Jason lost to the Republican incumbent, Nathan Deal.)</p> <p>Although Carter took the decision to make his mark outside politics and often in other countries after leaving office, it was clear that the state of his home nation still mattered deeply to him. He was frank in his view that the US had a long way to go on women’s rights (“it’s an embarrassment to our country, but it’s not changing”). And though he tried to be generous to his successor of the day, Barack Obama, it clearly rankled that he had not sought Carter’s advice more generally.</p> <p>“I’m not complaining … It’s natural for a president to call on someone who’s been there more recently,” he said diplomatically. Yet, with a twinkle in his eye, he added: “That’s what I prefer to think,” before confirming that the other presidents who succeeded him had called for his guidance. “Oh yes. All of them.”</p> <p>In the end, though, it is Obama’s own tribute to Carter that ultimately seems to do a more than reasonable job of capturing the man.</p> <p>“He believed some things were more important than re-election – things like integrity, respect and compassion … Whenever I had a chance to spend time with President Carter, it was clear that he didn’t just profess these values. He embodied them.”</p>",

The 61-year-old was not prosecuted after an FBI investigation, and Jolie declined to press charges.</p> <p>The long and bitter 99-month battle that followed centred on visitation and custody of their six biological and adopted children, who were all minors at the time of the separation but now range in age from 23 to 16. The warring actors have also been locked in dispute over their jointly owned winery and estate in France, Chateau Miraval, <a href=\"https://drinks-intel.com/wine/stoli-group-seeks-answers-from-campari-group-in-chateau-miraval-dispute/\">reportedly valued</a> at $162m (£130m).</p> <p>The story of Pitt and Jolie’s relationship began in 2004 when the couple, two of the highest-profile and highest-paid actors of their generation, were filming Mr and Mrs Smith, the tale of two married contract killers assigned to murder each other. He was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time; though Pitt and Jolie have said there was <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a140748/pitt-i-didnt-cheat-on-aniston/\">no infidelity</a> before he and Aniston <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/aug/23/news1\">divorced in 2005</a>, Pitt has since said he “<a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/brad-pitt-fell-for-angelina-on-mr-and-mrs-smith\">fell in love</a>” on the set of the movie.</p> <p>In January 2006 the couple confirmed they were expecting their <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1493502\">first child</a> together, adding to the two Jolie had already adopted from Cambodia and Ethiopia, whom she named Maddox and Zahara. The first photographs of Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, born in Namibia later that year and described by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501187.html\">one paparazzo</a> as “the most anticipated baby since Jesus Christ”, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/06/pressandpublishing.marketingandpr\">sold for millions</a>, with the proceeds donated to charity.</p> <p>They adopted another boy, Pax, from Vietnam the following year, and in 2007 their twins, Vivienne and Knox, were born, the photographs selling for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/pressandpublishing.celebrity1\">record £7m</a>. After years of feverish speculation the celebrity couple married at their French villa in August 2014, the photos <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/09/02/why-the-brangelina-wedding-pics-nabbed-just-2m/\">once again sold</a> for millions to People and Hello magazines. Two years later it was all over.</p> <p>Initially at least, there were some attempts to keep the dispute civilised. The couple released <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-reach-agreement-to-handle-divorce-privately/\">a joint statement </a>in January 2017 saying they were “committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification”, and announcing they had contracted a private judge to handle the divorce privately rather than through public court filings.</p> <p>In 2019, the divorce was “bifurcated”, a legal process allowing the couple to be legally <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-single-divorce/\">declared single</a> while the outstanding financial and custody matters remained unresolved. The private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon afterwards that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start again.</p> <p>They continued to battle over Chateau Miraval, with the warring parties locked in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/18/brad-pitt-sues-angelina-jolie-selling-stake-french-winery-chateau-miraval\">suits</a> <a href=\"https://people.com/movies/angelina-jolie-countersues-brad-pitt-over-winery-sale-dispute/\">and</a> <a href=\"https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1189620-brad-pitt-under-fire-over-misusing-chteau-miraval-funds-in-new-countersuit\">countersuits</a> after Jolie sold her stake in the Provence winery to a company owned by a Russian oligarch.</p> <p>It is not known whether the divorce agreement has resolved that dispute.</p>",

I’m not some nomophobic sheep who can’t go a week without checking their notifications. But anxiety rises like the tide. Soon I was frantically clicking “buy” and realising for once it’s not that simple.</p> <p>Smartphones have evolved since the last time I dropped one in a toilet. Now, losing my phone means losing my wallet with my credit cards, my driver’s licence and Medicare card. It means losing the access key fob to my office and the apps which I use for everything from booking classes at the gym to remotely controlling my TV and three-factor authentication for my work’s online systems.

I made my phone the guardian of so much of my identity that it’s now hard to prove I have one without it.</p> <p>Life was not always like this. I was a teenager when little black Nokia phones started appearing surreptitiously under desks at the back of classrooms. They had green calculator screens, stubby antennas and erupted with an earworm tune I hummed under my breath for most of 1997. They were sci-fi harbingers of “Beyond 2000” and I wanted nothing to do with them.</p> <p>“I’ll buy you one,” my dad pleaded but I was savvy to this trap. If I had a phone, I’d have to pick up when he called. Then he’d ask rude questions like “Where are you?” and “Are you OK?”. I simply wasn’t prepared to accommodate this intrusion into my adolescent freedom. Besides, who would I call? The first mobile phones were a divisive commodity. My friends and I mocked the clean-cut kids who phoned each other as they strode on to the oval for lunch. We called them the “business ladies”. They thought it was cool to have a mobile phone. We thought we were cool for not having them. We tussled over this for the last few years of the 20th century without any inkling of the stakes.</p> <p>Twenty-five years later and we are all business ladies. We all rush about, clutching our phones, ping-ponging between real and virtual spaces. Even high school kids seem tired these days and the idea that parents might at any time be ignorant of their location sends a ripple of moral horror through us all. Parental worries now extend beyond their kids’ wellbeing IRL and into the digital space, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/29/how-australias-tough-social-media-ban-compares-to-laws-in-other-countries\">Australia becoming the first country to attempt to ban social media</a> for under-16s.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/services/economics/perspectives/mobile-nation.html\">Deloitte reports</a> tracking Australian mobile use from 2019 to 2022 found that 90% of us use smartphones and forecast 5G technology will<a href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/impacts-5g-productivity-economic-growth.pdf\"> add between $1,300 and $2,000 per capita</a> to the gross domestic product by 2030. So whether we are coerced to upgrade by unsupported apps and smashed screens, or our lust for Apple AI or cameras that make our lives appear ready for fashion or food magazines, having a smartphone has become civic labour gussied up like privilege.

            "body" : "<p>Since Trump’s election win in the US, the idea of a “sex strike”, linked to a form of women’s activism that began in South Korea, has taken hold on social media. Like many things that become a mainstream buzzword, it is in fact about much more than the literal meaning of those words.</p> <p>This iteration of the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/15/4b-south-korea-feminist-movement-donald-trump-election-backlash\">4B movement</a>” is giving a voice and useful banner to women’s fear and rage across a nation that is increasingly refusing to provide basic reproductive rights and healthcare. Women are understandably scared about the consequences of unplanned pregnancy or pregnancy complications after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">repeal of Roe v Wade</a>. In addition, the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/feb/01/gen-z-boys-and-men-more-likely-than-baby-boomers-to-believe-feminism-harmful-says-poll\">attitude gap</a> between young adult women and men – that has seen young men move to the political right, while young women have remained largely more liberal – is no doubt also adding to what is being labelled by policy experts as a fertility crisis, but which is, in fact, a crisis in women’s lack of choice.</p> <p>Faced with these conditions, the idea of intentionally withdrawing from sexual relationships with men, domestic partnerships and motherhood begins to look like a practical option.</p> <p>The US 4B trend has been widely received as a feminist initiative, and has even been linked to the separatist movement and political lesbianism. Yet this is a misunderstanding of the intention and conditions giving rise to it. Such responses are also an indicator of the dearth of knowledge around feminist political theory and the history of feminism as a revolutionary social justice movement.</p> <p>The main problem with the idea of a women’s sex strike is that rape exists. Much of the commentary in response to women’s videos and content openly makes this point, as young men reply that women don’t always have a choice. The slogan “your body, my choice”, which has circulated online since Trump’s victory, bleakly summarises this stance.</p> <p>It is also debatable whether the idea of a sex strike is inherently a feminist act. A problem with seeing a sex ban alone as somehow revolutionary is that it plays into the very problems that arguably created the need for activism in the first place. In this framing, sex is labour – work that women do for men, and can then limit, manipulate or withhold alongside demands for improved conditions. That is not radical. Sex has long been defined under patriarchy as something men want and women should do. Such understandings of sex are why it took so long for rape in marriage to be recognised as a crime, for example – because how could a husband take from his wife what was rightfully his by the law of marriage? Framing sex as women’s labour for men results in sex being commodified and objectified, and the problem is that what can be bartered, exchanged or sold can also be taken. This is not an empowering position from which to call for revolution between the sexes.</p> <p>It was also never what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-election-sex-men-misogyny-feminism\">separatism</a> or political lesbianism was actually calling for – and maybe there is something we could learn from a real understanding of the tactics of these movements.</p> <p>Within the women’s liberation movement across the western world at least, separatism was a full-time women-living-with-women strategy. Examples included the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/24/style/womyns-land-movement-lesbian-communities.html\">women’s land movement</a> – women-only communes, smallholdings and businesses that spread across the US and Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. The point of separatism was to show that women could run things themselves, particularly with skills and knowledge traditionally denied to women, such as in construction, engineering and mechanics. Women-only communities empowered women by skilling up practically, but also by raising women’s confidence and providing a real-life example of their strength. Separatist living showed that women do not need men. That is not the same thing as saying that women did not <em>want</em> men. While there were lesbian communes and businesses, separatism was not an exclusively lesbian activity; it was women-only living and politics, often with no requirement or rules over individual women’s sexual orientation.</p> <p>Political lesbianism in the UK, meanwhile, can be traced back to a document titled Love Your Enemy?, which started life as a conference paper for a <a href=\"http://feministarchivenorth.org.uk/intro/\">revolutionary radical feminist conference</a>, written by a collective of radical and revolutionary feminists based in Leeds, Yorkshire. It was distributed in 1979 in Wires, the national feminist newsletter of the Women’s Information and Referral Enquiry Service. The paper proved so contentious that it was later published, along with a selection of letters of complaint and comment, in 1981, for a wider audience by the women-only publishing house Onlywomen Press. The article attempted to open up debate on sexuality generally and to trouble heterosexuality within the women’s liberation movement. It argued that sexuality is subject to degrees of social conditioning, and that, to some extent at least, heterosexuality is expected and institutionalised, with little societal tolerance for any alternative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/12/donald-trump-election-sex-men-misogyny-feminism\">After Trump’s election, women are swearing off sex with men. This has been a long time coming | Cécile Simmons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the height of the women’s liberation movement and intersecting social justice movements in gay liberation and Black Power, many felt that the revolution was just around the corner. Within feminism, radical activists believed that women should be spending all their energies on the women’s movement, not being distracted – least of all by caretaking for a male partner in the domestic sphere, where women are subjected to unequal care burdens and high levels of violence and control. The mirage of the idealised heterosexual nuclear family had already been blown apart by this time. Political lesbianism was not enforced sexual or romantic relationships between women, but the promotion of full-time focus on the women’s liberation movement.</p> <p>The mainstream take on 4B frames it as a sex strike by young, marketable, heterosexual women. An alternative would be to reject such sexist constructs of sex and sexuality, and to imagine, and work towards, an egalitarian future where men and women are not divided up into predator and prey. Rather than a sex strike, there is another tried and tested form of activism, utilised by women and men the world over: a workers strike, the withdrawal of our wage labour that fuels the systems of capital that dare to govern us. Ban patriarchy, not sex.</p> <ul> <li><p>Finn Mackay is the author of Female Masculinities and the Gender Wars, and a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of the West of England in Bristol</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>My most used and most terrifying app on my phone is the bewildering swamp wilderness of the Notes app. For those unaware, the app has a simple function – it’s a place to jot down notes. It’s like a notebook but on your phone. A simple way to organise your life across your various devices. Genius!</p> <p>And yet nothing causes me more existential dread than my Notes app because, for years now, instead of creating an ordered system of lists and separate topic-defined notes, I have shoved every single thought and message and draft and recipe and quote and password into one lumbering, behemoth note. A method of organisation turned into a scary hoarder’s lair, full of trash and secrets (my wifi password is in there, as well as several polite breakup texts).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/23/how-to-choose-new-years-resolution\">How to choose a new year’s resolution, according to clinical psychologists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s hundreds and hundreds of pages long, so hard to find anything important that it’s almost unusable, and is often hilarious in its contrasts. One memorable moment was copying a carefully worded answer to a job application from my giant note and accidentally pasting in the ingredient list for a Sri Lankan curry. Why am I perfect for this role? Cumin and garam masala, of course. I also regularly use it for work – a pithy celebrity quote I’ve taken from an article, sitting next to a middle-of-the-night concept for a novel about “huge sassy birds” and my tax file number.</p> <p>Almost tanking my job prospects via curry has been a wake-up call, so my resolution for 2025 is to finally destroy my giant note and create some order out of the chaos.</p> <p>There’s a superstition that says the manner in which you celebrate your New Year’s Eve sets the tone for the year to follow – so, if you’re surrounded by family and loved ones, you’ll spend the year blessed with the same situation. If you’re partying and dancing and smooching strangers on a dancefloor, you’ll have an adventurous 2025. Last New Year’s Eve I drank alone and force-fed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/15/my-greyhound-basil-is-an-awkward-loner-weirdo-now-i-know-how-my-parents-felt\">my greyhound</a> Valium while he shivered and cried every time a firework went off. That’s a good enough description of my 2024 to give credence to this theory.</p> <p>It’s also because of this concept that I’ve stopped setting myself new year resolutions – it seems a bad precedent to set yourself up for so much flagrant disappointment at the top of the year. We all know I’m not going to “get into hiking” or “understand superannuation” or “become less vengeful”. I don’t want to spend the entire year knowing I’ve failed, that I have a delusional goal hanging over my head.</p>    <p>Instead of trying to undertake herculean tasks like becoming a reward points person or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/27/deciding-to-read-a-book-a-week-was-the-best-new-year-resolution-i-ever-made\">reading a book a week</a>, or tackling giant existential concepts like “becoming more social” or being incredibly boring and doing any kind of exercise- or diet-related resolution, for the past few years I’ve started creating “new year’s treats” instead. The basic concept is to give myself something small, achievable and mostly unimportant to attempt in the new year. Last year my goal was to try lemon-flavoured yoghurt. I did and it was *drumroll* quite nice.</p> <p>It seems as though more and more people have decided to move away from the upsetting pressure of big new year goals. On social media there’s a new trend for “2025 bingo cards”. These act almost as a kind of vision board and can even provide a balance between more aspirational resolutions and the lemon yoghurt-style goals. The nice thing about this is it implies that you’ll never achieve all the goals – just enough to get a bingo. On the other hand, the spectre of an unfulfilled bingo card at the end of the year will be just as, if not more, depressing.</p> <p>Originally, I thought my resolution to destroy my Notes app was small, insignificant, even cute – a digital lemon yoghurt, a fun little task that might help me organise my life more. But as we tick over into 2025, I’m filled with a familiar dread at the concept.</p> <p>While the Notes app is small, it is symbolic, and I’ve accidentally fallen into the trap of thinking I can exert control over the chaos of existence through sheer new year resolution-based tenacity. And what does my swollen and lumbering Notes app represent if not the symptoms of a large and silly and busy life? Maybe it’s not a problem but something I should be proud of. Maybe instead of deleting my app, I’ll embrace it.</p> <p>Maybe instead of setting myself up for another failure, I’ll write my new year resolution in my even bigger note and, at the end of 2025, I’ll try to scroll all the way back and see which new flavour of yoghurt I’ve failed to try this year.</p> <ul> <li><p>Patrick Lenton is a writer.

            "body" : "<p>Growing up in Sydney, I knew the city prided itself on its “first light culture” long before the state government <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/brunch-and-wellness-to-drive-major-shake-up-of-nsw-tourism-strategy-20241007-p5kgcg.html\">made it the focal point of its tourism campaign</a>. It’s hard to miss the golden rays lighting the masses returning in their Lycra from runs in Centennial Park or surfing Bondi’s waves long before the work day has even begun. For one glorious morning, I joined them getting myself up to go to a 6am pilates class followed by a dip in the ocean. The beauty of the morning combined with the supercilious sense of having accomplished so much before my alarm normally went off was intoxicating. </p> <p>There was only one problem. I cannot get to bed early to save my life.</p> <p>As a child, I would get out of bed and feign an interest in overseas tennis tournaments to join my mother watching them late on television. In my teenage years I’d stay up past my bedtime to watch interviews on YouTube, and at university pulled more all-nighters than I care to remember. In recent years, influenced by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/15/sleep-perfectionists-the-exhausting-rise-of-orthosomnia\">culture increasingly concerned about sleep hygiene</a>, I have tried my best to curb what feels like a bad habit born out of a lack of self-control. </p> <p>In my mind, accepting this challenge of getting better sleep was synonymous with becoming a morning person, something I have never been able to do. So it is somewhat of a relief when Dr Moira Junge, the chief executive of the Sleep Health Foundation and an adjunct clinical associate professor at Monash University, tells me this is not a result of laziness on my part but <a href=\"https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/education-training/public-education/sleep-and-health-education-program/sleep-health-education-80#:~:text=The%20circadian%20rhythms%20generated%20by,determined%E2%80%94at%20least%20in%20part.\">a product of my genetics</a>. “It’s like our eye colour and our hair colour, we are predisposed to being naturally a night owl or a morning lark. But because of work and family commitments, not many of us have the luxury of living true to our chronotype,” Junge says.</p> <p>Junge’s advice is that I need to embrace my chronotype, sleep in as late as I can manage within the constraints of my work life and not try get up for a 6.30am yoga class if it’s going to make me feel tired all week. When it comes to what time I go to bed, Junge also wants to help me reorient certain beliefs I have around sleep. If my melatonin – <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=youtube+meaklim+2+process+model+of+sleep&amp;mid=E5A680AA72088BE52B8EE5A680AA72088BE52B8E&amp;FORM=VIRE\">the hormone the brain produces at night when it’s dark as part of the process that makes us want to sleep</a> – doesn’t come out till closer to midnight, “let’s not characterise [being awake at]<strong> </strong>midnight as naughty,” Junge says. She only wants me to be in my bed for the amount of time I’m realistically going to get sleep. Sleep is extremely individual, Junge says, but much of contemporary culture’s anxieties about what ideal sleep looks like makes us rigid and preoccupied in a way that is actually counterproductive.</p> <h2>Week one</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/01/australian-protein-bar-taste-test-summer24\">Australian protein bar taste test: the winner is ‘giving fitness, but not entirely unpleasant’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p>I go with my own plans; trying to get into bed before 11pm and leaving my curtains open so I can wake up with the natural light. Much of the week is marked by a familiar pattern of spending the day feeling tired, looking forward to an early night, but getting a second wind around 9pm. I persist but by Saturday afternoon I am utterly listless. I manage to muster up the energy to meet friends for dinner but don’t quite feel like the best version of myself.</p> <h2>Week two</h2> <p>I speak to Junge and am enlightened. The advice that’s easiest to implement immediately is to embrace “strategic napping” (planned naps no longer than 30 minutes) on days I have to get up early or otherwise feel I haven’t been able to get enough sleep. I have an especially busy weekend and have ended up staying out quite late Friday and Saturday night, exacerbated by the fact I’ve lost an hour of sleep with daylight saving. Nevertheless, I end up feeling much better this weekend than last because I nap and don’t try to soldier on despite feeling tired.</p> <h2>Week three</h2> <p>The change that’s starting to come over me feels quite miraculous. Instead of being anxious that I’m not asleep or even in bed by 11pm, I’m allowing myself to read until I notice I’m starting to yawn. I turn the lights off and instead of tossing and turning in bed, I nod off to sleep seamlessly. Actually being able to home in and recognise my own body’s signals for sleep is a change I can only compare to learning to listen and eat according to its hunger cues.</p> <h2>Week four</h2> <p>Despite last week’s success I have a bit more on my plate this week and face a familiar problem. Despite implementing my winding down routine – reading while having a cup of tea and chocolate, even scrolling on my phone if I want – I find myself alone in the darkness of my room with my mind still buzzing. I follow Junge’s advice that no matter the reason I shouldn’t be lying in bed for longer than a half hour and, if I am still alert or frustrated, I should get up from bed and unwind a bit more. I choose to write down some of the tasks I need to do the next day and try some mindfulness exercises.</p>    <h2>Week five</h2> <p>My sleep is definitely feeling more consistent than it ever has been because I am not oscillating between pushing myself to get up early some mornings and then catching up on sleep on others. Instead, I am just consistently allowing myself to go to bed at the time generally between 11 and 12 when I feel tired and get up as late as my work schedule permits. This week I am on a late work shift so I have the luxury of not even needing to set an alarm and waking up a little after 8am.</p> <h2>Week six</h2> <p>Instead of reading, one night I wind down talking to my sister who has called me from overseas. Luckily, I am less stressed about technology interfering with my sleep as Junge says the whole idea of needing to put your phone away two hours before you sleep is a “myth” and argues the problem of phones and blue light has been overstated. While it’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/its-almost-impossible-to-keep-teens-off-their-phones-in-bed-but-new-research-shows-it-really-does-affect-their-sleep-237955#:~:text=Sleep%20guidelines%20recommend%20no%20screen%20use%20in%20the,screen%20time%20once%20in%20bed%20that%20caused%20problems.\">not good to use your phone in bed</a>, Junge says it’s fine to use your phone before bed at night if it’s a relaxing use and the light is turned to night mode.</p> <h2>Week seven</h2> <p>A certain international election this week (it’s early November) sees my winding down routine again insufficient. I try to go to sleep but find my mind still alert so I get up and allow myself to read some more. When this happens, I don’t look at my phone or what time it is. I am getting better at being less preoccupied with how many hours sleep I am getting.</p> <h2>Week eight</h2> <p>I am noticing with more consistency in my sleep I am feeling more energised during the day, with far fewer days enduring a state of tired grogginess. Junge emphasises that “good sleep begets good sleep” – as ironically being sleep-deprived does not help that night’s sleep – so I feel like the work of the past few weeks are building on one another.</p> <h2>Week nine … the end</h2> <p>It’s perhaps the first time in my life I have a consistent sleep routine. I feel empowered by having better knowledge of what good sleep means and that I don’t have to harbour guilt for staying up later. The routine is definitely more bedded in, but at the same time the 66 days has gone more easily than I anticipated because part of my work has been to let go of the anxiety around trying to attain perfect sleep.</p>",

            "body" : "<p> I have a confession to make: I’ve eaten a lot of protein bars in my time. Back when I was working in hospitality, I kept a stash in my backpack in case of emergency. The emergency was if the staff meal looked inedible, or I didn’t have enough time to take a break and just needed something in my stomach. They were a means to an end. I didn’t focus very hard on registering their edibility.</p> <p>Thankfully, protein bars have come a long way. They are no longer hyper-sweet logs of cardboard and there are many more varieties, deriving their protein sources from whey to soy. Does this mean protein bars are now delicious? Hmm, questionable.</p>    <p>In this taste test, I chose bars that mark themselves as protein bars as well as a couple of energy bars to add variety to the mix. I picked energy bars with a higher protein content than an average muesli bar. For reference, I once had a nutrition coach who said that unless a bar is at least 40% protein, it’s technically an energy bar.</p> <p>These bars were judged by taste and texture, and while macros were taken into account, they did not contribute to the overall score. I also opted for the chocolate flavour of each brand to standardise the test, which made me appreciate real chocolate a whole lot more than I ever thought I could.</p>    <h2><strong>Best overall and best value</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Musashi Protein Crisp Bar Choc Peanut, 60g, $4.50 ($7.50 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 8/10</strong></p> <p>This one took me by surprise. At 20g per serve, it had one of the highest quantities of protein, bucking the general rule that the more protein a bar contains, the less enjoyable it tastes. The better score is probably because, instead of trying to mimic a chocolate bar, this one is a crispy treat made with soy protein “nuggets”. Texture-wise, it crumbles as soon as you bite into it and the protein nuggets are chalky on the palate after a chew or two. What saves the experience is actual chocolate (even if it relies on sweetener rather than sugar), peanuts and peanut butter. In other words: fat. Fat fixes all. Will it trick you into thinking you’re not eating a protein bar? No. But is it worth trying if you’re looking to bump up your protein? Definitely. It’s still giving fitness, but at least it’s not entirely unpleasant.</p> <h2><strong>Best energy bar</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Hillcrest On-the-Go Boost Protein Bars Triple Choc, 200g (5 bars), $3.99, ($1.99 per 100g), available at Aldi</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 8/10</strong></p> <p>If you like eating real food rather than compacted bars of protein powder, this one’s for you. It doesn’t contain a lot of protein (just 10.3g each serve), but a third of its composition is roasted peanuts and it’s drizzled in actual chocolate. Despite being made with real sugar, it wasn’t as sweet as some of the artificially sweetened bars I tried, which was a welcome change. Having actual food to chew was a plus, but there was a dusty aftertaste from the soy nuggets (again, with the nuggets!). While it technically isn’t a protein bar by nutritional value, it’s an easy way to bump up your protein consumption. It’s cheating without actually cheating.</p> <h2><strong>The rest</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Fibre Boost Cold Pressed Protein Bar Choc Choc Chip, 60g, $4.95 ($8.25 per 100g), available at health food shops and online</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 6/10</strong></p> <p>Holy fibre, Batman! At 26g of fibre per serve derived from corn (I am resisting the urge to make a joke about your body never really digesting corn, only renting it), not only does this bar live up to its name, it contains the same amount of fibre that an average human eats in a day, if not more. About 15 years ago I lived with a bodybuilder who confessed that all the protein he consumed backed him up. I assume this product was developed as an antidote to that problem, without forcing you to consume excess calories. The protein content is also notably high at 21g a bar, with negligible amounts of fat and carbohydrates. It was the softest bar I tried, sticking to the foil wrapper then to my teeth. The chocolate chips were artificially sweet without being offensive. Overall, it ate like a piece of function fudge cake (read: kind of stale). For people on a hardcore shred.</p>    <p><strong>Muscle Nation Custard Protein Bar Choc Fudge Brownie, 60g, $4.50 ($7.50 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 6/10</strong></p> <p>There is a gooey layer in the centre of this bar made from Muscle Nation custard powder, and this bar is trying hard to trick you into thinking it’s a chocolate bar through its soft, crunchy and chewy textures. It is almost successful. Where does the crunch come from, you ask. More of those chalky, soy protein crisps. All the artificial sweeteners (there are enough for it to come with an “excess consumption may have a laxative effect” warning) were at least balanced with salt. It wasn’t as stick-to-your-teeth as some of the other bars, but it did leave my mouth coated in a fatty film. Serviceable at 16.5g of protein per serve, but it didn’t rock my world.</p>    <p><strong>Crankt Protein + Energy Bar Chocolate Mudcake, 60g, $4.50 ($7.50 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 5/10</strong></p> <p>You know people who say they eat for function, not enjoyment? This is what I picture those people eating. The packaging claims this is both a protein and energy bar, but the nutritional panel indicates the energy doesn’t come from carbohydrates, but stimulants. Caffeine and guarana, to be exact – though the quantity is so low you’d get more pep from a cup of coffee. It tastes like an old-school protein bar in that it is soft and powdery from the first chew. It turned into paste in my mouth and had a strangely tangy aftertaste. Exactly what you’d imagine 20g of protein in a bar would taste like. </p>    <p><strong>BSC Soft Protein Bar Double Choc, 55g, $4.50 ($8.18 per 100g), available at major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 5/10</strong></p> <p>Even though the flavour is double choc, the sheer chocolatiness of this bar came as a surprise. On the softness scale, it fell somewhere in the middle, and ate like a solid Milky Way. Texturally, it was as sticky as higher protein bars, but only offers 16g per serve. The very definition of mid. If the texture was better, it would probably trick you into thinking it isn’t a protein bar. </p>    <p><strong>True Protein Bar Rich Chocolate, 63g, $5.50 ($8.73 per 100g), available at Woolworths, health food stores and online</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 5/10</strong></p> <p>This bar came with the shortest ingredients list. Primarily consisting of almonds and dates, it claims to be an “excellent source of dietary fibre”, clocking in at 11.4g. For a real food bar, it is also surprisingly high in protein (17.2g per serve). It is dried-fruit-sticky without glueing to your teeth and tastes much like those fruit and nut balls everyone was obsessed with making a few years ago, just with added protein. It’s probably the most “health food aisle” – tasting protein bar – in a wholefood, <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/almond-mom-viral-on-tiktok-diet-culture\">Almond Mum </a>way. You might hate it depending on your childhood trauma.</p>    <p><strong>Tasti Protein Fix Triple Choc, 225g (5 bars), $5.99 ($2.34 per 100g), available at Aldi</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 5/10</strong></p> <p>As I eat this, it becomes more and more evident the main ingredient bumping up the protein is the dreaded chalky soy protein crisp/nugget/puff. At least in this bar, it is smothered in chocolate, hidden among a rubble of peanuts and suspended in a super-sweet, chocolate-flavoured syrup. Still, its dustiness lingers. While this bar is aided in flavour by a hefty 33% real milk chocolate as well as real sugar, it swings too hard and is far too sweet. </p>    <p><strong>Hillcrest Protein Oat Bar Choc Chip Coconut, 200g (5 bars), $4.49 ($2.24 per 100g), available at Aldi</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 4/10</strong></p> <p>For a product with such little protein (5.6g per bar), I expected this to perform a lot better. Instead, I was shocked by how dry and crumbly it was. When I took a bite, more of the bar ended up on the floor than in my mouth. It tastes like those “rum” balls sold at school fetes that contain no rum and are made from coconut, condensed milk, crushed biscuits, cocoa powder and children’s fingerprints – except worse. Once I managed to swallow the dry oat mass, I was left with an unpleasant layer of fat on my palate that I can only put down to the margarine in the ingredients. </p>    <p><strong>Quest Protein Bar Dipped Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, 50g, $4.80 ($9.60 per 100g), available at </strong><strong> major supermarkets</strong></p> <p><strong>Score: 3/10</strong></p> <p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Back in the day, Quest bars were the gold standard of flavour and macros, but compared with newer options on the market, they come up short. As the sweetest bar of the batch, it was obviously an American product heavy on the artificial sweeteners. It had all the characteristics I fear from protein bars: chalky, plasticky and tacky. The chocolate coating dissipated as soon as it hit my tongue and it had an unpleasant, persistent caramel flavour. I wanted to brush and floss my teeth immediately after consumption.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>“Pastry and cheese are the best food groups,” says Sarah Rossi, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/whats-for-christmas-dinner-9780008685591/\">What’s for Christmas Dinner?</a> Happily, those two worlds collide in her brie and cranberry bites, AKA an easy, scalable canape that minimises time in the kitchen. Cut a sheet of puff pastry into squares, then push them into the greased holes of a muffin tin. “Dollop each one with leftover cranberry sauce and top with leftover brie. Brush with beaten egg, then bake at 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 for about 20 minutes, until golden.”</p> <p>Lettuce is another great carrier of leftovers, and especially Conor Gadd’s turkey and ham fried rice. The chef/co-owner of <a href=\"https://www.trullorestaurant.com/\">Trullo</a> in London starts by separating the leaves of a little gem. “Fry thinly chopped brussels sprouts, get some leftover turkey and ham in there, some [cooked and cooled] rice, sesame oil, fish sauce and a load of chopped spring onions and chilli.” Scoop the mix into the lettuce cups, and you’re done: “It’s a nice contrast from the traditional Christmas flavours,” Gadd says, though, to keep your snack game strong, he suggests perhaps finishing off with a scattering of chopped cashews.</p> <p>If, meanwhile, your party is a sit-down affair and you’re actually up for even more cooking, it’s got to be pie. After all, crisp, golden pastry welcomes a multitude of festive leftovers. Will Stoyle, head chef at <a href=\"https://www.silolondon.com/\">Silo</a> in London, starts by melting a knob of butter in a pan on a medium heat, then adds two sliced leeks and cooks them until soft. Meanwhile, he knocks together a bechamel (you want 300ml for this), then stirs in 150ml leftover gravy. “Add the cooked leeks, 300g chopped leftover turkey, 200g chopped leftover smoked gammon and some chopped fresh herbs [parsley, sage, thyme, say], and season.” Spoon the lot into a pie dish and spread evenly (Stoyle recommends putting a pie funnel in the middle), then top with flaky pastry. “Press the edges to seal, brush with beaten egg and bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20-25 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp.”</p> <p>Ravioli is also just the ticket for putting a bunch of Christmas dinner leftovers to good use. “Blitz any turkey, ham, sprouts, potatoes to a paste, then season with parmesan, salt and a big old crack of pepper,” says Gadd, who uses this to fill fresh pasta. And if you’ve got any leftover gravy knocking around, you’ve got an almost readymade sauce. “Melt some butter in a pan, pour in the gravy and that’s it!”</p> <p>Near-empty selection boxes, meanwhile, mean you’re well on your way to pudding. Whether it’s a dinner party or a New Year’s Eve buffet, one of Rossi’s favourite things to do is to reincarnate mini Maltesers and Cadbury Heroes (Dinky Deckers, in particular) as brownies. Other chocolates are, of course, available, and which you go for, Rossi says, is “more a personality question”, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/09/how-to-make-perfect-brownies\">a basic brownie batter</a> really does welcome all. Alternatively, Rossi suggests combining spent chocolate (melted, of course), biscuits and nuts, then rolling them into a salami and chilling. “It’s a really fun thing to do, and you get a lot of portions from it,” she says. Just add espresso (martini or otherwise).</p> <ul> <li><p>Got a culinary dilemma? Email <a href=\"mailto:feast@theguardian.com\">feast@theguardian.com</a></p></li> </ul>",

However, experts and advocates say that lawsuits that aim to hold the fossil fuel sector responsible for deceiving the public about the climate crisis still “have a clear path forward”.</p> <p>“The overwhelming evidence of the industry’s lies and ongoing deception does not change with administrations,” said Richard Wiles, president of the non-profit Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports the litigation. There are <a href=\"https://climateintegrity.org/lawsuits\">more than 30 accountability lawsuits</a> active around the US brought by states and municipalities accusing fossil fuel interests of covering up the climate risks of their products or seeking damages for impacts. “Climate deception lawsuits against big oil have a clear path forward no matter who is in the White House.”</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Trump <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/09/11/trump-vows-to-block-climate-litigation-against-big-oil-00114744\">pledged</a> to “stop the wave of frivolous litigation from environmental extremists”. </p> <p>But the administration’s ability to block the suits will be limited, Wiles said.</p> <p>Since the federal government is neither plaintiff nor defendant in any of the suits, Trump’s election will not directly affect their outcome. And since each case was filed in state court, the president cannot appoint judges who will oversee them.</p> <p>However, if any of the cases are sent to the federal courts – something oil companies have long pushed for but have not achieved – Trump’s rightwing appointees could rule in favor of fossil fuel companies.</p> <p>“The most important impact that Trump will have on the climate accountability litigation is the justices he has appointed to the supreme court,” said Michael Gerrard, the faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.</p> <p>In his first term, Trump appointed three justices to the high court, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/jan/16/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-case-recuse-philip-anshutz\">two</a> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/24/amy-coney-barrett-shell-recusal-supreme-court\">ties</a> to the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>In early December, Joe Biden’s solicitor general urged the supreme court to reject requests from fossil fuel interests to <a href=\"https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.2QDJN49wxP8WtGDlIEKgZUj6SCVamObnd0vSg6TK5FgAktoeGx8O3xI5Uq6wPtFE0H6h62oCsdYy4Cush8AYPEpx2IUHrLAIGJtUaOhiOvvQdJ1khsPx01wFkFNHukvj5FvK2fkuBQCS0Tb10voZjA-3D-3DzQ9E_9zSeFP1w5uBM-2FrFVTZzTH7D8qX16e0hB7b1f0c81TGsENPaaIQ2nJI4iWgJqb1lGmJhdKVS9g85xUSZO7E7CSg3d5d5NB6BSV-2FDAhukx1C2DcObZuaK59s1y7Lk-2BBLZWGJc68hGgRx08KwIiJelXV25rO9jetkEHqVmnCTfXZrlR7d8954U8GvyEgGPTsvNZRQjs50aMm13eQ9xcxsr5vqkrQah1ipK1xg7ZAf1tDWUIatV1aSz8rQLaVyj-2FsYSOpRDSwsoX5LRUFHA68REcPVqBWTZZzwpXevnunJQPwsEqpPByGHDP8Un3VIgiKAzwjmMUfUdRHcQ622IdqtHu8O2xC37QVlPXq-2Fbbvxiu4QkqhfWOiKfuVF879VyM7wG3PHzsXoR1XUkdQuYskrSqUA-3D-3D\">quash</a> two climate accountability <a href=\"https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.2QDJN49wxP8WtGDlIEKgZUj6SCVamObnd0vSg6TK5FgAktoeGx8O3xI5Uq6wPtFEe4Vo0KOyhpWs3zm2J-2BGLOuZ7rvXBof6ELDeqibd9mEqrC8ZcMUDXlzsTaJ-2BvmU5slCkd_9zSeFP1w5uBM-2FrFVTZzTH7D8qX16e0hB7b1f0c81TGsENPaaIQ2nJI4iWgJqb1lGmJhdKVS9g85xUSZO7E7CSg3d5d5NB6BSV-2FDAhukx1C2DcObZuaK59s1y7Lk-2BBLZWGJc68hGgRx08KwIiJelXV25rO9jetkEHqVmnCTfXZrlR7d8954U8GvyEgGPTsvNZRQjs50aMm13eQ9xcxsr5vqkrQah1ipK1xg7ZAf1tDWVg-2BsDYj1xUu9-2Btk1GE1an7l9AND0AkdtITgm4aeObLfaXaqPBJbibF5Bth5lYQFw7EoVH-2BVsleebKhanOmo5jd5FkVhsUD5JDehVgsGd443ck5LSPsY0U-2FTGss2QrtnQ6mxxz92L9fZziTWwYF8DI8VVZz5EA9Gd05GiHoiXtAVA-3D-3D\">lawsuits</a>, after a July call from the court <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061024zor_d18f.pdf\">for the administration</a> to weigh in. Experts say Trump’s White House could attempt to politically tip the scales in favor of the oil companies. </p> <p>“The views of the federal government tend to carry weight with the supreme court, so if Trump did that it would give a bit of a boost to the oil companies,” said Daniel Farber, who directs the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy &amp; the Environment.</p> <p>But that doesn’t guarantee that the court would agree with the administration, he said. “The court doesn’t always listen to the government’s view, and it would really depend on how persuasively they were able to argue the point,” Farber said.</p> <p>Trump’s justice department could also file influential “friend of the court” briefs in the cases, said Gerrard.. The Biden administration filed such a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1550/259222/20230316134530410_21-1550%20Suncor.pdf\">brief</a> in support of the plaintiff last year, whereas Trump’s previous<strong> </strong>administration reliably <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2020/19-1189_k53m.pdf\">supported</a> the defendants and is expected to do so again. </p> <p>These can have a significant impact on the outcome of a case, but similarly do not guarantee an outcome. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Another possibility advocates are preparing for: Trump could work with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress to attempt to <a href=\"https://climateintegrity.org/uploads/media/Pushing-Preemption-Report-2022.pdf\">offer legal immunity</a> to the fossil fuel industry from the lawsuits.</p> <p>But such a measure is unlikely to succeed, even with a Republican trifecta, said Farber.</p> <p>“You’d need 60 votes to break the filibuster in the Senate, and that means they would need to pick up seven Democrats,” he said. “I just don’t see that happening.”</p> <p>The firearms industry <a href=\"https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/other-laws-policies/gun-industry-immunity/#:~:text=In%202005%2C%20Congress%20passed%20the,of%20a%20firearm%20or%20ammunition.\">successfully</a> won a liability waiver in 2005 which has <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/frequently-asked-questions-gun-industry-immunity/\">successfully blocked most attempts to hold them accountable for violence.</a> Fossil fuel companies have <a href=\"https://clcouncil.org/about/partners/\">pushed to be granted</a> the same treatment, but have failed so far.</p> <p>The Trump administration’s pledges to roll back environmental regulation and boost fossil fuels could inspire additional climate accountability litigation. </p> <p>“If they feel like other channels for change have gotten cut off, maybe that would make the legal channel more appealing,” said Farber.</p> <p>Climate accountability suits<strong> </strong>filed by cities and states have gained steam in recent months. In December, a North Carolina town <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/04/carrboro-north-carolina-duke-energy-lawsuit\">launched</a> the nation’s first-ever climate accountability lawsuit against an electric utility.

Timothy West was perilously close to being a national treasure. Though in no way grand, he was the man you went to for Important People, mostly real and always played without comment. And he was also our dad.</p> <p>As the son and grandson of actors, he remained a fan of performers doing other things. Before a chance encounter with Harold Hobson at the first ever National Student Drama Festival made up his mind, he sold office furniture and worked as a recording engineer for EMI. To the end of his life he could quote you the catalogue numbers of their famous LPs.</p> <p>Da never liked staying in one place for long. He was a strolling player, a love of touring written through him like seaside rock. With ETT and Prospect Theatre Company, he played many of the great classical roles in dozens of theatres all over the country and the world. “In London,” he said, “people ask me who the director is. In Truro, they come up to me and say: “I’ve always wanted to see this play.” I suspect he would have liked to die doing his fifth <em>King Lear</em>, somewhere like Leicester.</p>    <p>On my parents’ 25th wedding anniversary, Tim gave a speech. “I’ve been married to Pru for a quarter of a century now,” he said. “She’s been asleep for about half that time. I’ve been quite busy. We do pass occasionally on the stairs. She seems very nice, I’m looking forward to getting to know her.” They chose to celebrate their golden wedding aboard the paddle steamer Waverley. Friends and family cruised under Tower Bridge, which opened for us. The 50th anniversary speeches were shorter: as the happy recipient of half a century of loving stability, all my brother Joe could think of to say was, “Mummy: thank you for having us. Daddy: thank you for coming.”</p> <p>Tim and Pru had a working marriage, and it worked. They put its success down to “prolonged and frequent separation”, though their natural reluctance to be seen as a showbiz couple melted a bit over the years. In 1984 they did a play together, <em>Big in Brazil</em><em>,</em> by Bamber Gascoigne (yes, that one), directed by Mel Smith (yes, that one). The critics didn’t care for it. But Pru and Tim – him in sock suspenders, her in Victorian underwear (aged 52, playing a 36-year-old) – had a ball. They decided that working together wasn’t the horror show they’d imagined, and did more of it.</p> <p>Two years later they shared a dressing room for <em>When We Are Married</em><em> </em>at the Whitehall, and were the happiest I had ever known, heading off together on the bus like&nbsp;teenagers.</p> <p>The cherry on the cake of working together was <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/great-canal-journeys-prunella-scales-timothy-west\">Great Canal Journeys</a>. </em>As a family, we’d been on narrowboat holidays since 1976; our parents knew their stuff. Their flirtatious, wine-fuelled wanderings over seven years made Slow Telly cool: they also grew a devoted younger audience, who used the show as part of their chillout routine.</p> <p>But appearing on screen with Pru meant confronting something that had become an open secret in the profession: my mother’s dementia. The first episode of <em>GCJ</em>, to Da’s surprise, became front-page news. The two of them took the chance to discuss Pru’s condition openly, and her philosophy, “I don’t always know where I’m going, but I always enjoy getting there”, became a favourite. Joe and I put in the odd appearance, and our half-sister, Juliet, went around the world with them doing Pru’s hair and makeup. Juliet no longer had a mum and Pru had never had a daughter, and the circle was closed to beautiful effect.</p> <p>Eventually the number of boats Tim and Pru hit became unreasonable and they had to stop. But it was a fine final act in a long life. My father maintained that <em>GCJ </em>was a show about industrial architecture. We knew that it was really a love story.</p>    <p>Da was a very good writer; as well as an autobiography and books on the canals and acting, he wrote hundreds of letters, and never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Long, funny tales of life on the road arrived regularly through my childhood (I think the love the envelopes contained is the reason I’m still a stamp collector). Months at home doing a play went unrecorded; a weekend trip to meet the pope produced an eight-page masterpiece. His enthusiasm and curiosity were infectious, and he wore a great heart lightly.</p> <p>Alan Bennett says: “If you live to be 90 in England and can still eat a boiled egg they think you deserve the Nobel prize.” At 90, Tim’s last screen role in the penultimate episode of <em>Doctors </em>was broadcast, by chance, the day after he died. It was a cough and a spit, but when you’re him, a tiny part gets called a cameo; he was just happy to be working.</p> <p>The outpouring of love and appreciation for our father has been extraordinary; the family has had thousands of messages from people who never met him, but to whom his life and work meant something. It’s comforting, and it’s also distracting. We’re finding our way through the fog. If you want to hear his voice as much as I do, head back to his recordings of Trollope novels: they’re the thing he was most proud of, and they’re all available free on Audible.</p>",

The director went from helming Hollywood blockbusters to <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-alex-proyas-get-his-next-feature-r-u-r-made#/\">asking fans</a> to cough up for his next project, which sounds quite fun: an adaptation of a 1920 Czech play about a robot-producing factory and the potential end of the world. It claims to be like “Brazil and Dr Strangelove meets Young Frankenstein and The Greatest Showman”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In a church built on stilts facing the sea, two 19-year-old American Mormon priests sit in front of the altar chatting to young Guna people. Elder Burr and Elder Aba, from the US states of Utah and Oregon respectively, reached the island of Kanir-Dup, in the Guna Yala (San Blas) archipelago in Panama, by pirogue more than four months ago, sent by their movement to teach the Indigenous community about the Latter-day Saints church.</p> <p>Since their arrival, the missionaries’ daily routines have been on a loop of prayers, sports, meals, Bible studies and services. Yet Burr does not seem to mind the repetition; he has his mind on the greater aim of his proselytising mission: “We are here to convert these natives,” he says.</p>    <p>History suggests that Burr and Aba’s task will not be simple: preachers are nothing new for the Guna people. For more than 500 years, <a href=\"https://sanblas-islands.com/info/history/\">these Indigenous people</a>, originally from northern Colombia and the Darién Gap, have been harassed by <em>conquistador</em><em>s</em>, Christian evangelicals, authoritarian governments and other Indigenous peoples who have tried to massacre, conquer or convert them. They have constantly been confronted with the outside world and fought against it, trying to preserve their identity at all costs.</p> <p>The first Spanish expeditions to the American continent began to be a threat in the 15th century, eventually forcing the Guna people to migrate to what is now known as the Guna Yala region. There they faced clashes with the Catios or Emberá people, who shared the same region of the Darién Gap, and with whom they had periods of tension and conflict over land and resources, mostly during the 19th century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/panama-zip/giv-4559g2FiVnYTyPU4\" data-alt=\"A map of Panama showing the Guna Yala archipelago and territory.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/panama-zip/giv-4559g2FiVnYTyPU4\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>From the 15th to the 19th centuries, the Guna people alternated between the mainland and the islands. Today, about <a href=\"https://www.tourismpanama.com/culture-cuisine/indigenous-communities/guna/\">62,000 of them</a> make their living from fishing, hunting, agriculture and subsistence farming of crops including rice, manioc, yams and coconuts, mostly in the archipelago but also on the mainland.</p>    <p>In 1925, they were the first Indigenous people <a href=\"https://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/la-revolucion-dule-una-rebelion-indigena-del-siglo-xx-920055/\">to proclaim independence</a>, fighting to found a republic that lasted <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/native-rebellion-and-us-intervention-central-america\">just a few days</a>, based on a federation of small groups, each with their own political, moral and religious council, practising an original form of shamanism and united by the same language.</p> <p>In February the Guna will celebrate the centenary of their ephemeral independence amid a new struggle for survival. This community is now fighting threats such as the climate crisis, mass tourism and the pressure to acculturate, as it tries to maintain its traditions and way of life.</p> <p>The Guna Yala islands are one of Central America’s most exposed maritime zones in the path of climatic phenomena. Their inhabitants face <a href=\"https://www.copernicus.eu/en/media/image-day-gallery/rising-sea-levels-threaten-panamas-san-blas-islands\">rising sea levels due to the climate crisis</a>, and pollution such as plastic waste and fuel from tourist boats.</p>    <p>In August, about 300 Guna families who lived in Gardi Sugdub <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2024/nov/06/panama-guna-people-forced-to-move-as-the-sea-swallows-their-island-in-pictures\">had to relocate</a> due to rising sea levels, coastal erosion and frequent flooding. Overpopulation and limited resources on the island further strained their ability to live sustainably on the island.</p> <p>These challenges, combined with government measures supposed to provide safer living conditions, have led to a plan for resettlement in Isber Yala, a purpose-built town on the mainland featuring new homes, schools and health facilities. </p> <p>***</p> <p>Adapting to changes created by the climate crisis or moving inland appear to be the only options for securing the Guna people’s future in this mosaic of more than 365 islands – 49 of them inhabited. In Gardi Sugdub, several chiefs representing those Guna people who remain on the island discuss the limits of offshore fishing. The lively debates reflect an inextricable situation: they have to navigate at night in a pirogue at sea for more than three hours in the hope of finding fry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are biodiversity. If we no longer exist, part of the world’s biodiversity will disappear</p> <footer> <cite>Iniquilipi Chiari</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nelson Mogran, 59, the head of the Guna community on the island, does not hide his discomfort with the changes he sees in the environment and the impact of too many visitors. “We’re being subjected to these hordes of tourists,” he complains.</p> <p>“Not only are there no more fish, but our corals are all dead because of mass tourism and the gas from motorboats.”</p>    <p>Yet 80% of the Gunas’ income comes from tourists, through offering services such as tours and accommodation. In the distance, dozens of the latest Zodiac motorboats speed off to the tourist beaches. Americans, South Americans and Europeans visit the archipelago on holiday, most of them unaware of the consequences their visits have on the Guna people.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Traditions play a central role for the Guna people. In this matriarchal culture, a newly married man must move into the home of his spouse and submit to the authority of his father-in-law. For young girls, the passage from puberty to adulthood is crystallised during unique spiritual ceremonies.</p> <p>On the day of one of these ceremonies, the whole village gathers in a hut measuring several dozen square metres. A banana leaf is placed over the entrance to scare away demons. As the hours pass, everyone drinks an alcoholic coffee concoction brewed locally.</p> <p>Crowded together, the Guna people dance and sing amid the scent of alcohol and pipe smoke. When the air becomes almost unbreathable, two wizards run into the middle of the hut wearing fish-tooth necklaces; no one may approach them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/sep/10/were-flooded-with-trash-human-tragedy-unleashes-environmental-disaster-as-thousands-attempt-crossing-to-us-darien-gap\">‘We’re flooded with trash’: pollution crisis as 500,000 migrants a year attempt perilous Darién Gap crossing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such Indigenous rituals are now mixed with Christian practices. The Catholic faith has been followed by many Guna people since the 15th century, after the colonisation of their lands by Spanish <em>conquistadors</em>, guided by Christopher Columbus. The Catholic Guna people throughout the archipelago also believe in the presence of a mother and father who watch over them from heaven. This heavenly protection is said to shield them from storms and rising waters.</p> <p>“Without religion, we couldn’t survive here,” says a Guna woman wearing a traditional tunic made from <em>molas, </em>colourful layers of fabric, cut and hand-sewn into designs.</p> <p>Burr and Alba’s mission is to attract new believers. Wearing a Guna tie over his meticulously ironed white shirt, Burr, a young blond man with bright blue eyes, leads the 10am Sunday service. In the Guna dialect, the Mormon priest reads passages from the Bible and distributes the sacrament to the 30 faithful present.</p>    <p>Sitting quietly in the back row, a young girl holds the Mormon Bible in Spanish on her lap. “We like them.

            "body" : "<p>Volker Kersting, Mainz academy director, sighed. Thomas Tuchel, as of Wednesday England’s new manager, had that look in his eyes. “He just said, ‘<em>Volker</em>’ and I knew what was coming,” Kersting said in Rulebreaker<em>,</em> the Tuchel biography by Daniel Meuren and Tobias Schächter. “I’d been dreading it. He really wanted to go up the mountain and dig up that pin.” </p> <p>“The pin” was a grubby, small Mainz badge which during a summer pre-season training trip in Austria for Tuchel’s then Mainz under-19s team had assumed almost sanctified status. Alongside four-hour training sessions – something of a shock for teenagers – Tuchel also displayed the gift for team bonding that he will require for the England job. One day in Austria, Tuchel insisted the whole squad hire mountain bikes and ride to the summit of the Simmering mountain, where they had lunch and admired the beautiful views before the head coach demonstrated his rhetorical powers, using the moment to tell the team that their goal was to win the league, something never achieved previously by Mainz’s youngsters. Tuchel wanted a ceremony to mark the covenant between team and coach so made do with Kersting’s Mainz badge, which was solemnly wrapped in a Snickers<em> </em>wrapper and buried at the mountain top. “When we reach our final, we will return to dig up our treasure!” Tuchel told them.</p> <p>Fast forward 11 months to June 2009 when Mainz had qualified for the Bundesliga under-19 final, the title being decided in an end-of-season playoff. The semi-final had just been won when Tuchel turned to Kersting: he wanted to go back to Austria, climb the mountain and recover the pin. So Tuchel, Kersting and another club official drove the 300 miles south to Obsteig, Austria, climbed the mountain, dug up the pin and returned to Mainz, unbeknown to the players.</p>    <p>Another coach might have improvised and found a pin in the club shop. The effect would have surely been the same? Tuchel’s nature meant that authenticity mattered. He even filmed the digging up of the pin so the players knew it was real. As they prepared for the final, against Borussia Dortmund’s equivalent age-group team, Tuchel’s team talk rose to a climax and he lifted the lid from a covered bell jar in the centre of the dressing room to reveal the pin. “Here is our treasure!” he cried triumphantly. “We have kept our promise, we retrieved our pin! Now complete our dream and win our treasure, the cup!”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2024/dec/31/david-squires-on-footballs-headline-grabbing-acts-from-2024\">David Squires on … football’s headline-grabbing acts from 2024</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The boys were so pumped you can’t even describe it,” Kersting recalled in Rulebreaker. “They could have beaten anyone.” And Mainz did beat Dortmund 2-1, with two future World Cup winners in Mario Götze, scorer of the winning goal in the 2014 final against Argentina, and André Schürrle competing for Dortmund and Mainz respectively. Also in the crowd was Dortmund’s first-team coach, Jürgen Klopp, formerly of Mainz. “Today the best team beat a team with the better players,” Klopp told his friend and former boss, Christian Heidel, Mainz’s then managing director. It was a huge compliment to Tuchel, who would eventually be Klopp’s successor at Mainz and surpass even his feats there.</p> <p>For Tuchel is a tactical guru, graduate of Germany’s <em>Stuttgarter Schule</em> of coaching, which includes his mentor Ralf Rangnick, the Germany coach, Julian Nagelsmann, and Klopp. He has the instinct and gameplan to upset the odds in major finals, which was evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/manchester-city-chelsea-champions-league-final-match-report-kai-havertz\">Chelsea’s 2021 Champions League final win</a> over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City, which is why he has been appointed by the Football Association, his brief being to add tactical edge to Gareth Southgate’s cultural reboot so that the national team can respond in clutch moments when previously they froze.</p> <p>The fear is that he will lose what Southgate had painstakingly rebuilt in terms of morale. Southgate inherited a squad where players routinely made excuses not to turn up and banished that negativity with overnight camping on Dartmoor and ending alone phone-time in hotel rooms with ensemble board games such as Werewolf<em> </em>and Uno<em>, </em>all<em> </em>supplemented by touchy-feely psychotherapy. Yet the mass withdrawals of senior players before the Greece and Republic of Ireland games in November under Lee Carsley signalled that work might be quickly undone. “It takes a long time to build, and maybe not so long to lose if you’re not careful,” said Harry Kane of team culture.</p>    <p>So Tuchel’s EQ, as demonstrated in his treasure hunt, will be as crucial as his IQ if England are to win the 2026 World Cup. And there are definitely two sides to the new England coach. He is both the man who inspired those teenagers but also the coach whom Schürrle had to approach after a few months with the under-19 squad to ask him to dial down his intensity because it was demoralising the youngsters. He is the man who brought on 20-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi for Chelsea at Southampton and then substituted him after 31 minutes, seemingly oblivious to the fuss it would create. Yet he is also the man who won Hudson-Odoi around the very next day with a heart-to-heart chat where he explained his reasons and his belief in the player, who would go on to play important roles in the starting 11 in the 2021 Super Cup final and the Club World Cup final, trophies won under Tuchel at Chelsea.</p> <p>Tuchel is well attuned to the importance of sensitivity to young players, even if his touchline demeanour, gurning in disgust when a mistake is made, belies that fact. When he failed to make it as a player at Stuttgarter Kickers he had worked under a coach, Rolf Schafstall, who was popular with many but was “poison for a player like Thomas” according to a teammate. “Tuchel, why don’t you learn to tackle? What should we do with you?” were examples of the tough love relayed by Schafstall which destroyed Tuchel’s confidence as a young man, according to Rulebreaker<em>.</em> The impact was clear. When he graduated from the German FA’s coaching course in 2006, the psychology section Tuchel presented focused exclusively on this relationship and its effect on him.</p> <p>Yet his interactions with players at his last club, Bayern Munich, at times seem to provoke tension and relationships were mixed. You can’t take entirely at face value the former Bayern president Uli Hoeness’s assessment that he was a “disaster”; there is an element of corporate face-saving in that prognosis after the club failed to win the Bundesliga title for the first time in 11 years. Yet there is no doubt that an icy chill blew through sections of the Bayern dressing room at times. Joshua Kimmich, club captain and Bayern stalwart, was one made to feel unwanted.</p> <p>It remains to be seen which coach turns up for England duty. Some will doubtless feel a few home truths wouldn’t go amiss to England’s lauded national team, while Southgate lovers will fear for fragile team unity. All those concerns, however, will be subsumed by the biggest question of all: whether, at the end of 18 months, Tuchel will finally end England’s 60-year long treasure hunt. If he does, no one will care how he does it.</p>",

They seemed accustomed to the attention that comes with being the home town of the longest-lived and, by many measures, most active former occupant of the White House.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/30/jimmy-carter-foreign-policy-\">From Panama to Palestine, Jimmy Carter refused to let his moral voice be silenced</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All those who spoke to the Guardian had an anecdote on hand about the man they considered a neighbor, a “regular guy” who just happened to have helped eradicate guinea worm in Africa, won the Nobel peace prize and led a disastrous operation to free US hostages in Iran, among many other milestones.</p> <p>Only a few minutes down US highway 280 from where Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, lived in town, Haley Beverly, 29, and her daughter, Rosemary, two, were picking up their mail shortly after noon. Beverly’s husband, Robert, has been the pastor at Plains Methodist church, next door to their house, for eight years.</p>    <p>“It’s the same church where Jimmy and Rosalynn were married,” Beverly volunteered. That was on 7 July 1946, and the couple stayed married for 77 years, until Rosalynn’s death in 2023. “We used to see them walking in front of our house, holding hands – and the black Escalade [of the Secret Service] following slowly behind,” she recalled. “Just like a pair of sweethearts, so down to earth.”</p> <p>The repeated scene made an impact on Beverly. “We’re a young couple – to see a family built like that, in a pressure cooker like the presidency … that was a big inspiration for us,” she said.</p>    <p>Down the road toward the center of town, the Plains mayor, Joseph “Joey” Recker, was unlocking the door to city hall, covering for the city clerk while she was on her lunch break. Recker, elected in May after the previous mayor had been in office for 40 years, said he and Carter were “backdoor neighbors”, meaning “my house butts up to his property”.</p> <p>Recker, who is 60, said his children used to play on the Carters’ land, “shooting squirrels with a BB gun”, adding: “Of course, I would call the Secret Service first.” Noting the reaction the anecdote caused, he said: “That’s a normal way of living in Plains – though it might look odd to others.”</p> <p>The mayor is also a musician, and remembers being hired to play piano at a birthday party for Carter when he was a young man. “He always made you feel like an equal,” Recker said. “I could talk to him like I’m talking to you.”</p> <p>The mayor of Plains said that Carter “came along at a time when this nation needed honesty at the highest level. You could see he was an honest man, and that’s why he got elected. Whether as President Carter or Jimmy Carter, he lived what he believed. What you see is what you get … I don’t know if there’s a higher compliment you can pay to a man.”</p> <p>As for his role following Carter’s death, Recker said, “My job, as mayor, is to wrap my arms around the locals, and make sure they get to grieve” – including fielding media requests, like a CNN interview he was scheduled for several hours later.</p> <p>Across the railroad tracks from city hall, Milton Mills came out of the Plains Pharmacy, having left his bicycle unlocked in front. Now 62, Mills has lived in Plains since he was an infant. “I worked for him when I was 15 or 16,” he said, referring to the Carter family’s peanut farm, where Mills would pack peanuts into bags during summers, “to have money for school clothes”.</p>    <p>Mills, who is Black, said that Carter “would talk up for Black people – but it was hard to make change”. When elected Georgia’s governor in 1970 , Carter made <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/13/archives/new-governor-of-georgia-urges-end-of-racial-bias-georgia-governor.html\">national headlines</a>, memorably saying in his inaugural speech that “the time for racial discrimination is over”.</p> <p>Yet Plains itself bears lingering after-effects when it comes to race. Mills pointed in one direction across the railroad tracks and said: “That’s where most white folks live.” In the opposite direction: “That’s the Black side.” The <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/georgia/plains\">population</a> of Plains is about 56% Black.</p> <p>A retired welder, Mills said now that Carter is dead, “two or three years from now, there’ll probably be no stores open here, and this whole town’s gonna be a historic site”. For decades, visitors have come to Plains, to catch a glimpse of the former presidential couple, or to see Carter <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/carter-was-nations-sunday-school-teacher/KO453X6YWZCEFFMJPKLE2KAU34/\">teach Sunday school</a> at Maranatha Baptist church.</p> <p>Over at Bonita’s restaurant, the only Black-owned business in the center of town, Bonita Hightower was juggling TV interviews and catfish and meatloaf orders. “I’m sad/happy,” she told a CNN reporter. “He left so much; he left a happy path for anyone who wants to do anything great. He did it, and came back to rest – and that’s what you’re supposed to do.”</p>    <p>Hightower repeated an anecdote she has <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/carters-legacy-among-towns-black-residents-as-strong-as-ever/DGDKFIB4X5AKRJRD6HUPCFYBG4/\">told elsewhere</a>, about how Carter’s family would order fried catfish, cheese grits and coleslaw for the former president. “He could’ve chosen to live anywhere,” Hightower said. “He chose to come back home.”</p> <p>Just then, three elderly Black women entered the restaurant. They had driven from Lafayette, Alabama. Barbara King, 84, said she “admired” Carter, as the “first to express his views on race relationships openly like that”, referring to the former president’s opposition to segregation and discrimination.</p> <p>“I just wanted to be here,” said 77-year-old Sara Calloway, sitting across the table. “I cried for President Carter yesterday,” she said. “He was just a plain old white man who wanted to do good – nothing fancy about him.”</p>",

And we weren’t just dependent on this one single announcement from the Americans.”</p> <p>The absence of weapons was not confirmed publicly until 2004, when the US Senate and then the CIA published reports finding no evidence. Speaking last month, Howard said he was “disappointed” but not surprised.</p> <p>“That was a blow,” Howard said. “I still tenaciously maintain the decision [to deploy] was taken in good faith.</p> <p>“We never thought for a moment Australia would pull out of the reconstruction. Definitely not.”</p>    <p>The 10 February 2004 record reveals the government resolved to emphasise concern about weapons in its public messaging.</p> <p>“The committee also noted the importance of highlighting in the government’s public remarks that Iraq had failed to account for significant quantities of weapons of mass destruction that had been documented by the previous UN inspection process,” the NSC minute said.</p> <p>Although Howard cited the presence and potential of weapons as a key justification for joining the war in his 18 March 2003 announcement, the archives’ cabinet historian, UNSW associate professor David Lee, said it was never the main reason.</p> <p>“The balance of evidence we’ve seen from the cabinet records from 2003 and 2004 indicate that weapons of mass destruction is not the casus belli – the cause of war – for Australia, but rather Australia’s desire to strengthen the US alliance,” Lee said. He said Howard had been determined to do more to boost the alliance than his predecessors Paul Keating and Bob Hawke had done.</p> <p>Last year, 82 records were found to be missing, including what turned out to be 14 documents on the Iraq conflict, 13 of those from the NSC.</p> <p>The missing files were located and a review by former defence department secretary Dennis Richardson found the omission was not deliberate. The archives released the missing Iraq-related records on 14 March.</p> <p>The Iraq deployment comprised three operations – Bastille, covering pre-deployment and training which transitioned to Falconer, covering combat operations until Saddam Hussein’s government was disarmed, and then Catalyst, through Iraq’s anticipated stabilisation and recovery.</p> <p>Operation Catalyst began on 16 July, a 12-month commitment of up to 999 Australian personnel. The then defence minister, Robert Hill, went back to cabinet on 29 July seeking more money, explaining the cost of all operations had been underestimated by $637.9m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/israel-hospital-attacks-gaza-healthcare-on-brink-of-collapse-says-un\">Israel’s hospital attacks have put Gaza healthcare on brink of collapse, says UN</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The documents show there was growing unease about the cost. In its comments on the July submission, the finance department pushed back on aspects of the request.</p> <p>It noted that Hill was seeking “retrospective funding approval” for elements of Operation Catalyst. The department said the funding should be approved, then capped.</p> <p>“Should Defence seek any further expansion or extension of Operation Catalyst, it should absorb the cost,” it said bluntly.</p> <p>It pointedly noted “rapid acquisition funds” allocated initially were still unspent and that Hill was now seeking to transfer them to current operations. Finance said since the funds were “claimed to be urgently needed before the troops were to deploy to Iraq, where possible any contracts that have not been delivered be cancelled and the saved funds returned to the budget”.</p> <p>It tallied the cost of all other current operations in Afghanistan, Bougainville and Solomon Islands and the border-protection operation Relex off northern Australia, warning any contemplation of extending the Iraq contribution further should have regard to what had already been spent.</p> <p>But later that year, cabinet was turning its focus to the commercial opportunities for Australia in a post-Saddam Iraq, especially the lucrative wheat trade, which would become the subject of international controversy by 2005.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 January 2025 to correct the spelling and rank of Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The day parliament was dissolved for the 2004 federal election, senior Howard government ministers met to authorise almost $4bn in sweeteners to announce during the election campaign.</p> \n<p>A cabinet minute from 31 August 2004 records that three of the biggest spending promises Howard announced in the five ensuing weeks were signed off at that meeting in the government’s final hours.</p> \n<p>Released by the National Archives on 1 January, the records of cabinet’s deliberations throughout 2004 show Howard and his colleagues were acutely conscious of the politics of their decisions as they prepared to seek re-election.</p> \n<p>In that 11th-hour meeting, a pared-down cabinet of unnamed “senior ministers” allocated more than $1.7bn to increase the Medicare rebate for all GP visits from 85% to 100%, to take effect from the following January. They spent another $1bn for a new tax rebate of up to $500 for mature-age workers – backdated to 1 July – and $83m increasing the rebate for local medical services to veterans from 100% to 115% of the schedule fee. That was on top of a veterans’ access payment which Howard had authorised the day before.</p> \n<p>The previous day, cabinet’s national security committee had directed that legislation be drafted to implement the recommendations of a recently completed national intelligence review and authorised millions of dollars in extra funding for agencies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f1759ea1-118a-4bb2-88b3-43fd1e32edee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PLG8iwgB00Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Cost of living ‘all-pervasive’</h2> \n<p>Speaking last month ahead of the release, Howard noted that then, as now, Australians were under financial pressure in an election year.</p> \n<p>“The cost of living was all-pervasive,” Howard recalled. “And although things have changed a lot, one thing hasn’t changed and that is the dominance of cost of living as a pervasive political issue.”</p> \n<p>Howard described 2004 as “a year that went up and down – and ended very agreeably”.</p> \n<p>The records show cabinet grappling with major issues of global and national security, including climate change, the war in Iraq and the fear of terrorism, ever-present since the 11 September 2001 attacks and the 2002 Bali bombings. Several of the 2004 cabinet records relating to terrorism remain sealed.</p> \n<p>Two years on from the devastating Bali attacks, cabinet was focused on devising a plan to protect critical infrastructure, with agencies directed to conduct “red team” testing to identify vulnerabilities. Ministers Philip Ruddock, Daryl Williams and Ian Macfarlane secured $50.6m in a decision taken swiftly to “counter criticism of alleged ‘slow progress’”.</p> \n<p>After a bomb went off outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta on 9 September 2004, the cabinet moved fast to fund blast-proofing of the windows of all diplomatic missions worldwide.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/01/eyes-on-the-poll-five-themes-that-will-mark-australias-politics-in-election-year\">Eyes on the poll: five themes that will mark Australia’s politics in an election year</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The government’s hardline policy against asylum seekers remained a key focus. On 29 March, the cabinet received an update on its strategy to combat people-smuggling and discussed creating new offences, among other measures aimed at avoiding Australia receiving an adverse listing in a US congressional report on countries not doing enough.</p> \n<p>In the same month the immigration minister, Amanda Vanstone, sought cabinet’s agreement to increase the number of skilled migrants and expand the humanitarian category by 1,000 places and the refugee intake by 2,000. The prime minister’s department opposed the refugee increase, warning that a rise from 4,000 to 6,000 would carry “higher costs and greater risks of unsuccessful integration into the broader community”.</p> \n<h2>Howard’s confidence in spy agencies</h2> \n<p>The cabinet commissioned an official history of peacekeeping, not including operations in Timor-Leste, and endorsed the view of the veterans’ affairs minister, Danna Vale, that it must not be subject to “censorship” other than to protect official secrets. Vale noted the Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq operations would be handled separately, but counselled against the delays that had plagued histories of the Vietnam and Korean conflicts.</p> \n<p>She said the Iraq volume was slated for 2009. Like the volumes on the Afghan conflict, it had still not been published in 2024. The second Timor volume <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/16/dfat-accused-of-attempting-to-censor-official-history-of-military-operations-in-timor-leste\">is still being vetted</a>.</p> \n<p>In August, the cabinet was briefed on negotiations with Timor-Leste over maritime boundaries. Much of that record is redacted and one other on the subject has been withheld. Nine years later, leaked information revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/10/witness-k-and-the-outrageous-spy-scandal-that-failed-to-shame-australia\">Australia’s secret intelligence services had bugged the Timorese cabinet room</a>.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the release of the records last month, Howard said he could not remember “the detailed discussions” about relations with Timor.</p> \n<p>“I had such confidence in our external intelligence services that I think they would have always behaved in a way that promoted the Australian national interest.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/israel-hospital-attacks-gaza-healthcare-on-brink-of-collapse-says-un\">Israel’s hospital attacks have put Gaza healthcare on brink of collapse, says UN</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On 1 April 2004, the government had legislated to allow Asis to work more closely with foreign counterpart agencies, even those that might employ violence, and to use weapons to protect themselves.</p> \n<p>But the cabinet explicitly directed that Asis officers were not permitted to engage in violent or paramilitary activities themselves, nor use weapons for anything other than self-protection. </p> \n<p>Earlier in the year, ministers had wrestled with the cost of placing air marshals on planes – and the refusal of Qantas to provide free seats for them.</p> \n<p>In a minute marked “Australian eyes only”, cabinet’s expenditure review committee authorised increasing the number of air marshals available for domestic and international flights, especially on Asian routes where the risk of a terrorist attack was deemed greatest. A trio of ministers sought an extra $43m over four years for the AFP, $14m of which was to pay for seats for the marshals. They reported that Qantas was only willing to provide seats free of charge on domestic flights and a 50-50 funding agreement for international flights was due to expire.</p> \n<p>Ministers warned that unless the funding issue was resolved, Qantas was likely to accuse the government publicly of failing to provide support for counter-terrorism.</p> \n<p>One domestic policy was proposed but then abandoned. On 22 March, the cabinet endorsed Howard’s proposal to seek to change the constitution so re-elected governments could use a joint sitting of both houses to pass legislation blocked in the previous term without having to call a double dissolution. But the public response was so negative he dropped it less than three months later.</p> \n<p>Howard went on to win a majority in both houses at the election on 9 October, but would overreach with his WorkChoices legislation, resulting in him being tossed out of office – and his own seat – three years later.</p> \n<p>The prime minister was also accused of playing wedge politics with a bill to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to allow scholarships specifically for male teachers. The education minister, Brendan Nelson, wrote to Howard about the issue in February 2004. Without receiving a formal submission, cabinet authorised the attorney general, Philip Ruddock, to draft legislation.</p> \n<p>The move enraged some in the Labor party, with the WA MP and former premier Carmen Lawrence writing in the Sydney Morning Herald that the government was “using a potentially divisive social issue to political advantage”.</p> \n<p>“It has already used such tactics on all the usual suspects – the people the Howard government has encouraged us to think of as ‘not one of us’ – Indigenous Australians, refugees, single mothers, the unemployed, homosexuals,” she wrote.</p> \n<p>The sex discrimination commissioner and former NSW state Liberal minister Pru Goward also raised concerns about creating discriminatory scholarships. The bill was introduced on 11 August but never passed, lapsing when parliament was dissolved 18 days later.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>John Howard was given the option of adding extra words to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/28/gayrights.australia\">2004 Marriage Act amendment</a> that would have limited transgender people’s ability to marry by making eligibility based on gender at birth, but chose not to pursue it.</p> \n<p>Cabinet papers from 2004, released by the National Archives, show the Howard government was advised it could go beyond the formal definition of marriage it ultimately enshrined in law, and stipulate that a couple must have been born male and female respectively to be allowed to marry.</p> \n<p>The papers confirm the government’s decision to formally define marriage was driven by concern about new laws in the ACT allowing same-sex adoptions. It was also concerned about overseas same-sex marriages and anticipated pressure to recognise them in Australia.</p> \n<p>The cabinet decided on 16 February to call for advice, and less than a fortnight later the attorney general’s department responded, highlighting that Western Australian and Tasmanian law also permitted same-sex adoption and raising possible ways to address this.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>“A formal definition of marriage could be included in the Marriage Act,” the department proposed in a memorandum to cabinet on 27 February 2004. It advised that a specific provision could also be inserted that overseas same-sex marriages would not be recognised.</p> \n<p>“This would represent a clear statement of the existing legal position and pre-empt attempts by some couples to approach the Family Court for recognition of same-sex marriages entered into under Canadian law in particular.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"56d433b2-b1e0-4b66-a0ca-1e4935b6e520\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JaL35JGqXLs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Howard adopted that position. However, the advice went further, suggesting the cabinet could also ringfence the institution of marriage from other perceived threats, including from transgender people.</p> \n<p>“The Marriage Act could be amended to define the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a person is a man or a woman,” the attorney general’s department memorandum advised.</p> \n<p>The memo noted that the federal court had established a precedent for transgender marriage the previous year in a case known as Re Kevin by accepting the post-operative gender of someone who had undergone reassignment surgery. It suggested the Marriage Act could be used to counter this.</p> \n<p>“If the Marriage Act were to define ‘man’ and ‘woman’ by reference to their sex at birth, a transsexual person who has undergone sexual reassignment would not be able to marry in their reassigned gender,” the department advised.</p> \n<p>It cautioned about other implications, including that “any definition relying on biological characteristics at birth is likely to preclude intersex people from marrying”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/01/eyes-on-the-poll-five-themes-that-will-mark-australias-politics-in-election-year\">Eyes on the poll: five themes that will mark Australia’s politics in an election year</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It warned that if cabinet agreed to the proposed change, any marriages involving transgender people between the time of the federal court ruling and the passage of the Marriage Act amendment would be considered lawful.</p> \n<p>“The announcement of a proposal to introduce legislation may be an incentive for post-operative transsexuals to marry,” it said.</p> \n<p>Further, the departmental memo advised that any such definitional change relating to gender at birth would need to be restricted to the Marriage Act, given the criminal law and social security already acknowledged transgender people.</p> \n<p>It noted further potential “practical issues” to be overcome in relation to any reference to birth gender, including that all jurisdictions except Victoria allowed for a sex change to be registered and a new birth certificate issued.</p> \n<p>“A possible alternative might be to require an addition to the declaration that parties to a marriage must make [sure] that there are no legal impediments to their marrying,” the memo said. “Approximately 100,000 marriages take place in Australia each year and some members of the public may find intrusive a question as to their sex at birth.”</p> \n<p>On 15 April, cabinet resolved to legislate to define marriage as “the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” without adding any reference to birth gender, and to state explicitly that same-sex marriages ratified overseas would not be recognised.</p> \n<p>It also agreed to legislate, relying on the constitutional external affairs power, to not recognise overseas adoptions by same-sex couples, but did not proceed until three years later, after Australia’s first legal adoption by a gay couple occurred in WA in June 2007. The legislation did not pass before the Coalition lost government later that year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/israel-hospital-attacks-gaza-healthcare-on-brink-of-collapse-says-un\">Israel’s hospital attacks have put Gaza healthcare on brink of collapse, says UN</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Speaking in advance of the cabinet papers release, Howard said he could not recall the birth-gender proposal and did not seriously consider it.</p> \n<p>“I had no intention at that time of doing other than inserting into the act the definition given by the [English courts],” Howard said.</p> \n<p>In August 2004, Howard told a national marriage forum his proposal to define marriage in legislation was “an opportunity” that he hoped parliament would grasp within a fortnight.</p> \n<p>“It is not far-fetched to imagine that if we don’t change the law, there could in the future be some judicial experimentation,” Howard said at the time. “I don’t think this is something that should be decided by the judges. If the law of this country is to change, it should be changed by the people’s representatives and by nobody else.”</p> \n<p>He argued the Marriage Act amendment was not stripping rights from anyone. A week later, the amendment passed with the Labor opposition’s support.</p> \n<p>“It doesn’t seek to take away from others in the community any rights they now have. Rather it seeks to reaffirm the pre-eminent place of marriage and the margin for marriage, if I can put it that way, that has always existed in our society,” he said.</p>",

Artist Gilbert Stuart painted only Washington’s face from life; the body was a stand-in. The canvas is also replete with symbols: a rainbow, an inkwell shaped like Noah’s Ark, books about the American revolution and constitution.</p> \n<p>Portraits are a four-way fabrication, argues Sajet, director of the <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/museums/portrait-gallery\">Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery</a>, an oasis of calm in the maelstrom of modern Washington. There is the subject: the more famous they are, the stronger their opinion. There is the artist, striving to be true to their own aesthetic. There is the patron, often with a strong, very particular view of their own. And finally there is the one party that constantly evolves: the audience.</p> \n<p>“The most immediate portrait you can imagine today is a selfie or snapshot on your phone,” the 59-year-old says. “But even then we manipulate how we take those pictures constantly; particularly now with filters, you can do all sorts of things to make yourself look good. Portraiture is always just a moment in time and those moments are becoming shorter and shorter in terms of what actually constitutes the reality<em>.”</em></p> \n<p>Sajet is the first female director of the National Portrait Gallery, <a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/about-us/history\">founded by Congress in 1962</a> and now home to a collection of about 26,000 objects that attracts about 2 million visitors a year. She is also uniquely cosmopolitan: the daughter of Dutch immigrants, she was born in Nigeria, raised in Australia and is a citizen of the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>The back story is that after the second world war her mother, who had been interned in a Japanese camp in Indonesia, and her father, who had been sent with his family to the Dutch countryside because of air raids, decided to emigrate. “My father was completely driven by where he could sail. He’d been in the merchant marines in the Netherlands so we ended up in Australia because he wanted to get a boat.”</p> \n<p>Sajet’s father arrived without a job but started a successful paper business that took the family to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a> for a few years. Her mother, who had been a social worker in the Netherlands, studied for a master’s degree in psychology and found work placing children in shelters.</p> \n<p>Sajet maintains her Dutch citizenship and still travels there regularly to help care for a severely disabled brother who is deaf and highly autistic. “That coloured everything. One of the reasons that I went into the arts was because I was working every weekend with children with disabilities and completely surrounded by the disabilities community.</p> \n<p>“There was a certain point where I thought to myself that, I know I can do this but what else am I especially interested in. That’s when the arts appealed to me.”</p> \n<p>Growing up in Melbourne, she had fallen in love with art at 15 when, on a school trip to the Adelaide arts festival, she saw the Edward Hopper’s <a href=\"https://whitney.org/collection/works/6081\">Soir Bleu</a>, which depicts a sad clown smoking a cigarette. She trained as an art historian and, at 24, became Australia’s youngest museum director, heading the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery.</p> \n<p>Sajet recalls fondly: “It was great because it’s a small museum but you have to do everything. I used to go shopping and say to the lady, can I wear this frock at a cocktail party but then also change the lights? And she was like, what do you do?!</p> \n<p>“I recommend people going into the arts – whether it’s theatre or writing or museums – consider working in a small institution first ’cos you get to play multiple roles and be a big fish in a little pond for a while.”</p> \n<p>Arriving in the US with her family in 1997, she held positions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/kim-sajet-named-us-portrait-gallery-chief-087204\">She was appointed director</a> of the National Portrait Gallery in 2013.</p> \n<p>The gallery’s collection includes portraits of influential Americans ranging from sports stars and entertainers to poets and civil rights leaders. Located less than a mile from the White House, it also houses 1,700 portraits of presidents including about 270 of George Washington alone.</p> \n<p>Visitors flock to the <a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/exhibition/americas-presidents-reopened\">America’s Presidents</a> exhibition, which contains pictures of every US president with bilingual (English and Spanish) labels that aim to sum up their mark on history in just 140 words.</p> \n<p>Sajet comments: “I will get emails saying, ‘I can’t believe that you said this about President so-and-so’ or ‘Oh, and you left out X, Y, Z’. Whenever we get a comment, whether it’s presidents or anything else, we take it back, we look at it and we say, do we agree or do we disagree?</p> \n<p>“We try very much not to editorialise. I don’t want by reading the label to get a sense of what the curator’s opinion is about that person. I want someone reading the label to understand that it’s based on historical fact.”</p> \n<p>Sajet is in no doubt that all portraits have an agenda. But in an ever more polarised political environment, the gallery, which shares a historic building with the Smithsonian American Art Museum, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/program/talk-to-al-jazeera/2024/9/22/kim-sajet-on-us-presidential-portraits-and-leadership-evolution\">strives to remain above the fray</a>.</p> \n<p>“What you say, how you choose to say it, what you feature more than what you may not feature – I know these are all decisions made by individuals but we try very hard to be even-handed when we talk about people and that’s the key. Everyone has an opinion about American presidents, good, bad and indifferent. We hear it all but generally I think we’ve done pretty well.</p> \n<p>“The big advantage of the America’s Presidents gallery is that you see American history through the arc of a long timeframe going all the way back and keep everything in perspective. We’re all so caught up in the moment but it behooves us to also cast our thoughts back and ask, how did we get here in the first place? What acts were taken by individuals that got us to the first place? Portraiture makes history personal and it’s not about just memorising names and dates.”</p> \n<p>The exhibition maps the history of art, from Victorian portraits of bearded men to the abstract expressionism of Elaine de Kooning’s <a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/blog/elaine-de-koonings-jfk\">rendering of John F Kennedy</a> (De Kooning is the only female artist currently represented). When Lyndon Johnson saw his portrait by Peter Hurd, he declared it “the ugliest thing I ever saw”. Artist Norman Rockwell admitted that, finding Richard Nixon’s appearance elusive, he decided to err on the side of flattery.</p> \n<p>America’s Presidents concludes with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/obama-portraits-kim-sajet-smithsonian/index.html\">Barack Obama</a> (a hugely popular work painted by Kehinde Wiley in 2018) and Donald Trump (photographed by Matt McClain in 2017) separated by the thickness of a wall and facing in opposite directions. (Sajet, who tries to match presidents with suitable artists, hopes that Joe and Jill Biden will sit for their portraits soon.)</p> \n<p>The delicately crafted 161-word caption for Trump includes the following: “Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837-1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.”</p> \n<p>One day the Trump photo will make way for the official Trump painting. It has already been completed: the gallery found an artist who visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and hit it off with him. Had Trump lost the election in November, the work would have been unveiled next year. But his return to the White House means that the portrait will remain in storage until 2029.</p> \n<p>Sajet is not giving anything away about the artist’s identity or the painting’s current whereabouts but feels confident that Trump and his supporters will like it and find it suitably presidential. Still, does she find that the current Trump photo – and its caption – provoke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/14/donald-trump-national-portrait-gallery-photo\">strong and divided reactions</a>?</p> \n<p>“It’s a little bit like, get in line,” she muses. “We have the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/why-elaine-de-kooning-jfk-portrait-broke-rules-180975959/\">Elaine de Kooning portrait</a> of John Kennedy. It’s very abstract. It was painted well over 50 years ago and I get a lot of people saying, ‘This is disrespectful.’ They expect a traditional president in a suit behind the desk and this is not that.</p> \n<p>“We have in the gallery right now a fabulous loan from the National Gallery of Art, a Chuck Close portrait of [Bill] Clinton and again, people are like, this is not what they expect to see. I wouldn’t say the Trump has had more attention than others; I’d say it’s probably about the same.”</p> \n<p>Naturally, presidents who are still in living memory attract more such attention. “We get less critique about Millard Fillmore, for example, because no one can remember that. Where you get the critique is the people that they remember growing up: Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Trump because they lived through it.</p> \n<p>“Americans measure time by who’s in the Oval Office and that really comes out. People have an opinion because they grew up under those presidencies or their parents did or their grandparents did and they would talk about what life was like when so-and-so was in the Oval Office.”</p> \n<p>When former president George HW Bush died in 2018, the gallery <a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/exhibition/memoriam-george-hw-bush\">draped his picture in black velvet</a> and visitors came to pay their respects. This week it is doing the same for ex-president Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday aged 100. There have also been homages to prominent Americans such as Senator John McCain, the basketball player Kobe Bryant, the actor Robin Williams, and the singers Aretha Franklin and Prince.</p> \n<p>Sajet explains: “When somebody passes away and we have their portrait, we put it up on the first floor and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-one-museum-helps-nation-mourn-180974175/#:~:text=When%20the%20nation%20loses%20a,wall%20by%20the%20next%20day.\">people line up</a> to be first in the museum because they grew up with these people. We often put a condolence book out so they can sign it because they’ve got nowhere else to take their grief or show their respect.”</p> \n<p>Pablo Picasso was quoted as saying “art is a lie that makes us realise truth,” and the portrait gallery embraces paradox. It is surely fitting that this most American of institutions is run by a Nigerian-born Dutchwoman who speaks with an Australian accent (familiar to fans of <a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/podcast\">the Portraits podcast</a> she has hosted since 2019). Sajet has come to think of this global perspective as her “superpower”.</p> \n<p>“I have a great love for the United States and it’s home for me but I do think that there is a real advantage in also being able to stand back. If anything, I don’t think Americans realise how much impact they have across the globe. When I grew up in Australia I was watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/07/she-was-very-complicated-she-was-a-conundrum-who-was-the-real-lucille-ball\">I Love Lucy</a> on television and we listened to American pop music and we followed American fashion. Sometimes I think Americans look inward so much and they fail to see what an impact they have across the world.</p> \n<p>“Maybe part of my advantage is to say actually what began in the United States has this ripple effect. Reminding Americans of the tremendous gift that they’ve given to all of us is always a good thing. I’m very proud of being at the portrait gallery of the United States because there are such remarkable people that have shifted the needle not just within the US but across the globe.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Councils in England are paying millions to relocation companies to help them permanently move homeless families out of big cities and the south-east in a practice that has been called a “national scandal”.</p> <p>A Guardian analysis of local government spending data shows that councils in the UK’s two biggest cities, London and Birmingham, and more than a dozen local authorities across the south-east of England have given more than £5.2m to firms that facilitate moves to cheaper parts of the country since 2020.</p> <p>The companies find cheap homes in areas where rents and local housing allowance (LHA), the amount those claiming housing benefit can claim towards rent, align. Rents in much of the country have not kept pace with LHA, meaning these properties are often located in smaller, deprived towns in the Midlands and north of England.</p> <p>People relocated using these firms are discharged into the private rented sector and are deemed permanently rehoused. Usually, any connection with the original council ends, making it near impossible for them to return home.</p> <p>In London, families living in costly temporary accommodation, which is paid for by councils, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/10/councils-move-hundreds-homeless-families-london-24-hour-ultimatums\">sometimes given only 24 hours</a> by councils to accept the offer of a new home in another part of the country and are told they will be kicked out of emergency housing if they refuse.</p> <p>Experts raised concerns about what they called “social cleansing” and “racialised, coercive displacement”, where people of colour are moved to largely white areas where they know nobody. MPs in the north-east said people were being relocated to already very deprived communities with no additional support provided.</p> <p>Among the companies being paid by councils to help relocate tenants are Reloc8 UK. Local authorities in London and Birmingham city council have paid the firm at least £3m since 2020. More than 40% of this amount has been paid in the past year. </p> <p>The use of these firms appears to have increased year on year, with a sharp rise in payments by councils in 2023 and 2024, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-rising-homelessness-a-crisis-made-in-government\">homelessness across England increased dramatically</a>. When taking account of all the firms identified by the Guardian, 30% of the £5.2m sum has been paid in the past year alone.</p> <p>Reloc8 UK said it had procured homes in London and Birmingham over the years but said “there are times when certain areas are more prevalent due to availability, affordability for tenants and many other factors”.</p> <p>Reloc8 UK also provides transport and removal services for relocated families as well as basic household furniture and appliances. The firm said that, at a minimum, it provides families with a brand new cooker, fridge-freezer and beds, the costs of which are paid back by councils.</p> <p>The sums paid to Reloc8 UK also include incentive payments to landlords to encourage them to accept low-income tenants.</p> <p>Reloc8 UK said it could not comment on individual councils’ policies, but<strong> </strong> many families had used its services to move on a voluntary basis. The firm also said councils saved about £20,000 per family over a two-year period compared with if they had remained in temporary accommodation.</p> <p>London councils have made the heaviest use of these firms, paying them almost £4.8m since 2020. Waltham Forest council alone has paid Reloc8 UK more than £900,000 since 2020.</p> <p>Enfield council has paid Reloc8 UK more than £600,000 since last August alone. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/10/councils-move-hundreds-homeless-families-london-24-hour-ultimatums\">report recently found</a> Enfield was the London local authority sending families the furthest from their jobs, schools and support networks. The council has said that most of the households to which it provides temporary accommodation will end up moving out of the borough and often away from the south-east of England. </p> <p>The movement of homeless families, who are disproportionately from ethnic minority backgrounds in England, into towns that are largely white, has raised concerns. Dr Shabna Begum, the chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, called the practice “racialised, coercive displacement” and said it was a “shameful indictment of our broken housing system”.</p> <p>She said: “We know that people of colour are much more likely to experience homelessness and are therefore more exposed to this practice of enforced displacement out of our cities. We are talking about working-class communities of colour being forced to move out of areas which they know as home – to areas where many have reported feeling isolated, vulnerable and exposed to racism.”</p> <p>“There is a disproportionate racialised impact and this should be a national scandal.”</p> <p>Councils have called on the government to raise LHA rates annually, which they say would relieve the huge pressures on homelessness services, stem soaring temporary accommodation costs and prevent “last resort” out-of area-discharges. Ministers have announced LHA rates will remain frozen until 2026.</p> <p>Durham county council, the largest local authority in north-east England, said homeless people from London were being moved to the area without their knowledge. The Northern Echo <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/24630437.single-mum-baby-forced-move-county-durham/?ref=twtrec\">reported</a> in October that at least 24 households were privately discharged to the city last year, with some families reportedly sent up with little more than a key and an address.</p> <p>Mounting outcry by MPs in the region prompted the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, to <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/24738288.reaction-deputy-pms-warning-councils-moving-families-north-east/\">warn councils</a> last month against surprise relocations, reminding them of their “legal responsibilities”. </p> <p>Mary Kelly Foy, the MP for the City of Durham, said: “It’s beyond belief that managing agents are making money from what appears to be little more than social cleansing. Not only is it desperately unfair on families that are being dropped in to areas with no ongoing support in place, it’s shameful that no additional support is being provided to the communities in which they being placed, often already battling extreme poverty and deprivation.”</p> <p>Grahame Morris, the MP for nearby Easington, said: “Offering families the option to move to areas like County Durham is one thing; forcing them to relocate under the threat of homelessness is quite another. This practice is no longer a rare exception but a matter of routine. When these councils neglect their duty, it falls to community groups and charities in my constituency to pick up the pieces.”</p> <p>Since 2010, councils’ funding from central government has fallen by 46%. This has coincided with a decrease in social housing stock, a lack of affordable private housing and a sharp rise in homelessness in many parts of the country. These challenges are particularly acute in London.</p> <p>Between 2013 and 2023, the number of social housing homes owned by local authorities and housing associations in England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/09/social-rent-homes-in-england-fall-by-more-than-quarter-of-a-million-in-decade\">fell by more tha 250,000</a>. In October, a <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/lha-update-needed-as-just-5-of-london-private-rentals-affordable-to-people-on-low-incomes-study-finds-88952\">study by Savills found</a> that only 5% of homes in London were in line with LHA. In July, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/23/homelessness-england-highest-level-on-record-national-audit-office-report\">National Audit Office (NAO) found</a> that homelessness had hit its highest levels since records began. Councils in London are collectively spending about £4m a day on temporary accommodation.</p> <p>Waltham Forest and Enfield councils said private sector discharges were done in line with local policies and processes, and that housing demand in their areas outstripped supply, meaning they were forced to look beyond their boroughs and the capital for accommodation.</p> <p>Birmingham city council said it had used Reloc8 and another firm to help 27 families secure homes in the city and beyond, adding that moves out of the city were done only with households’ participation and agreement.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 31 December 2024. Waltham Forest and Enfield councils said housing demand was outstripping supply, not the other way around as stated in an earlier version.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>For much of the 20th century, the numbered streets of Horden housed a thriving community of mining families who took pride in their small but well-kept homes. Matriarchs would scrub their porches and the streets were clear of any rubbish. Fortunes changed when the local colliery, which was one of the largest in the country, closed in 1987.</p> <p>Today, many houses in this deprived pocket of east Durham are abandoned. Smashed windows and rubbish-strewn streets are a common sight. In efforts to improve the image of the area, the local council has installed fake doors and windows to cover up the sad state of these once-loved homes.</p> <p>As the area falls into deeper disrepair and local people continue to leave, there has been an influx of new arrivals: homeless families, many of whom feel they have been forced there by big city councils located hundreds of miles away.</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to people and families sent up from London after a 24-hour threat of eviction from temporary accommodation if they refused an offer of a private tenancy in the area. Young single mothers and recently recognised refugee families are often those given the ultimatum.</p> <p>Among them is Faruk (not his real name). He and his nine-year-old son arrived in Horden with little more than a pillow each. After presenting as homeless to a London council, he was told his only option was to accept the private tenancy more than 250 miles away, otherwise he would be making himself intentionally homeless and would receive no further help.</p>    <p>“The council told me if you don’t take this house, you’re homeless. Nobody else, no other council, will help you,” he said. “I wasn’t happy to come here. It’s so far from London. I knew nothing about Horden.”</p> <p>Faruk has no neighbours. The two homes on either side of him are boarded up. “The council said, if you come to this house you will have everything, it will all be ready.” When he arrived, there was no gas or electricity in the property. He did not know which company, or if any company, was involved in his relocation.</p> <p>He said a man met him upon arrival and gave him a key, who said he would be back the next day to “help him with everything”. He has not returned.</p> <p>Faruk is Muslim but the nearest mosque and halal supermarkets are in Sunderland, more than 10 miles away. “It was so hard for me. I didn’t have any friends. No one was helping me, I was going crazy here.”</p> <p>He is a single father and struggles to speak English, which has hampered his ability to find a job. “When my tenancy finishes, I’m scared I will be homeless again and have nowhere to go.”</p> <p>He turned to <a href=\"https://www.eastdurhamtrust.org.uk/\">East Durham Trust</a>, a local poverty charity, which he credits with helping him settle into the area. It enrolled him into an English class at a local college and helped fix the problems in his home.</p> <p>“It’s not giving them a chance. They’ve placed him there with a child who is potentially influenced by his surroundings,” said Georgia Miller, who works at the charity. “He’s going to struggle to get into work. They’re putting these families into areas where there’s not the facilities that they need.”</p> <p>The charity has seen a recent spate of people sent from London approaching it for help. “It’s been going on for years but now it’s happening a lot more, and it’s becoming a lot more noticeable,” said Helen Waller, who works alongside Miller.</p> <p>“We had one gentleman, who had been moved up from London, who had severe mental issues. There was no toilet in his property so he ended up defecating in his garden,” said Waller.</p>    <p>Many of the homeless Londoners moved to the area are not white. “Going back, not even that many years, you wouldn’t see many people from ethnic minority backgrounds around here. It was predominantly white. The areas they are putting these families in are not always tolerant. I can imagine them facing racism,” said Waller.</p> <p>Horden already had its own social problems before the newcomers arrived, with the abandoned homes in the numbered streets becoming secluded hotspots for drug users and dealers. “The majority of people here are decent people but you’ve got a small amount of drug dealers and those on the down and outs. Because it’s such a small place, it stands out like a sore thumb,” said Stephen Rowe, a support officer at the charity.</p> <p>“Now, you’re getting people moved up from other parts of the country. They’ve got their own vulnerabilities so they’re ideal targets.”</p> <p>The new arrivals have not only come as a surprise to local people. Durham county council said people had been moved to the region without its knowledge. The north-east is grappling with its own growing homelessness crisis, with the Northern Echo <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/24530509.hundreds-north-east-children-temporary-accommodation/\">reporting</a> that hundreds of children in the region are living in temporary accommodation.</p> <p>“We have seen a rise across the board in need. When you bring even more vulnerable people into that space, it is undoubtedly going to add pressure,” said Graham Easterlow, the chief executive officer of the East Durham Trust.</p> <p>The charity provides a range of services including financial advice, food parcels and call-in sessions for vulnerable people.</p>    <p>“We are a very welcoming place, the community spirit here is massive. But should that be exploited by other councils seeking to inappropriately discharge their housing duty? No,” he said. “Human beings are bearing the cost of this policy.”</p> <p>In recent years, the north-east has been seized upon by real estate firms and property investors, including those based abroad. They are lured by rock-bottom house prices and healthy rental incomes. Zoopla has <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/property-news/best-buy-to-let-locations/\">crowned</a> the north-east as the best region for buy-to-let investors looking to claw back their initial investment quickly through rents.</p> <p>There are many good-quality places to live in Horden but the cheap, shoddily kept homes in the numbered streets are usually where discharged families are sent. They are among the vanishingly few properties across the country that are in line with local housing allowance rates (LHA) – the amount private tenants claiming housing benefit are entitled to towards rent.</p> <p>Homes in the numbered streets are sold at online auction for as little as £16,000. Some streets are almost wholly owned by investors. A two-bedroom home can generate about £5,000 to £6,000 a year on the private rental market. </p> <p>LHA entitlement for a two-bedroom home in Horden is £5,680 a year, meaning that once occupied, landlords can receive guaranteed rents, footed by the taxpayer, and can usually recoup their investment in about 48 months.</p> <p>Despite the challenges Horden faces, the village is by no means defined by them. The surrounding area is full of natural and industrial beauty. A short walk from the village centre is an earthy beach with grand, grassy cliffs above. Castle Eden Dene, a national nature reserve, and Denemouth Viaduct are a stone’s throw away.</p> <p>The council has recently started <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-67367377\">a project</a> to reuse old coal water to heat the village, a scheme that could be rolled out across the country. Plans are also under way to regenerate the numbered streets, including more than 100 high-quality new homes.</p>    <p>Despite the current state of the numbered streets, much-loved haunts from the area’s glory days still stand. On Sixth Street, where children would play until dusk, the Grade II-listed St Mary’s church sits at the end of the road. Miller was one of those kids.</p> <p>“My great-grandparents lived in the street. When I was young, we would go once a week. I just remember it being happy times, all the family together and the community was great. Everybody knew everybody,” she said.</p> <p>While the area was being used to plug a homelessness crisis unfolding hundreds of miles away, Miller hoped it could soon flourish on its own terms. “There’s still lots of good places and things happening in Horden. It would be good if we could fill the houses and have a community back.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Travel north on the east coast mainline, the main London to Edinburgh route, and you may spot the gift John Smith received from colleagues last year.</p> <p>The huge sign, which stands metres away from the line just north of Peterborough station, carries the Sunderland AFC emblem alongside two arrows, one pointing 85 miles south to Wembley, the other 188 miles to the club’s Stadium of Light. “The lad who did it was a Newcastle supporter, so it was through gritted teeth,” says Smith, the boss of GB Railfreight and a lifelong Sunderland fan.</p> <p>The sign stands next to a maintenance depot – the first depot GB Railfreight owned after it was launched in 1999.</p> <p>Initially a branch of the now defunct rail operator GB Railways Group, the freight business, which Smith was asked to launch, was aimed at making the most of new opportunities after rail privatisation in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>From winning its first contract in 2001, GB Railfreight has become one of the largest freight companies in the UK, alongside DB Cargo and Freightliner, operating 173 trains and employing more than 1,400 people. In that time, its ownership has changed four times, with M&amp;G’s infrastructure arm Infracapital its current owner, but Smith has remained at the top of the company.</p> <p>It has also diversified away from freight during this period, with GB Railfreight operating all maintenance trains for the Elizabeth line tunnels, while also providing the drivers for the Caledonian Sleeper train between London and Scotland.</p> <p>But transporting goods is its core business. This includes moving aggregate for construction, fuel for power stations (such as the Drax biomass plant in Selby, North Yorkshire), and large containers from the UK’s deep seaports in Southampton, Felixstowe and London Gateway near Thurrock in Essex.</p> <p>The railways are in his blood. Smith was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, but as a result of his dad working for the RAF, he moved around a lot. He regards Alnwick in Northumberland as the place where he spent his most formative years – particularly in terms of what football team he chose to support.</p> <p>A teenage trainspotter, he says he would often tell his mum he was just visiting nearby York station before travelling as far down as London to seek new trains. He also admits he still has a model railway in his garage, which he continues to enjoy when he gets time between managing fullsize trains.</p> <p>“Back when I was growing up, it’s what young boys did, and it led to quite a few people taking careers in the railway,” he says.</p> <p>Starting out as an apprentice in a carriage works in York, he then became an engineer. Getting a national certificate, he studied at Loughborough University before starting a four-decade career in the railways, 25 of these leading GB Railfreight. “The railways was great as a nationalised industry back then because it allowed you to travel: you could apply for jobs here, there and everywhere,” he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Over the last five years, what we pay for fuel and track access charges, the cost of our wagons has gone up by 25%</p> <footer> <cite>John Smith</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, while nationalisation offered early career opportunities, he has reservations over whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/24/labour-promises-rail-nationalisation-within-five-years-of-coming-to-power\">Labour’s plans to fully renationalise passenger services</a> will fix all of the UK railway’s problems.</p> <p>“There will be many good railway people who get buried in how they set this all up, the legislation, taking the bill through parliament,” he says. “It is going to be so diversionary, and kind of moves away from a train going from A to B.”</p> <p>Freight has largely been spared any moves to nationalise, but Smith still fears there might be some impacts on the business, particularly if freight carriers lose their protections under current legislation.</p> <p>“If rules aren’t clear, then, for example, the mayor of Manchester might say, ‘I don’t want freight trains running through Manchester Piccadilly to Trafford Park. I’m going to stop it all’,” he says. “If the law allows them to do that, then that’s a risk.”</p> <p>Smith clearly knows the business back to front. He greets every colleague he bumps into at the Peterborough HQ by their first name, and can talk in detail about the status of each one of its trains as we walk through the business’s nerve centre, its operations room.</p> <p>A straight talker, he describes a former unnamed transport secretary as a “pillock”, while telling the story of how he had to explain just how much the UK economy relied on deep-sea imports.</p> <p>He is also not afraid to criticise government over decisions he disagrees with, including the deal it struck with the unions to end the long-running pay dispute that has blighted passenger services over the past two years. “I was surprised that a settlement was reached without any productivity benefits,” he says. “I think it’s fair to say that, particularly after two years of disruption suffered by the public on the passenger side, to come out with nothing seemed a little bit strange.”</p> <p>But it is chancellor Rachel Reeves’s budget he reserves his biggest criticism for, describing it as “brutal” for business. “What they’ve decided to do in the budget is not business-friendly at all and that has concerned a lot of businesses,” says Smith.</p> <p>“It’s about people acting entrepreneurially, it’s about developing businesses, and you’ve got that sense of negativity.”</p> <p>In 2023, the company made an operating profit of £28m on revenues of £321m. Smith says the environmental benefits of transporting by rail rather than road are clear. GB Railfreight estimates that an average freight train carries the same amount as 129 lorries, and reduces emissions by 74%.</p> <p>And it intends to go further, having invested £150m – its largest ever investment – in a fleet of 30 new electric-plus-diesel bi-mode locomotives, whose engines will run on vegetable oil and significantly reduce emissions. The environmental benefits are recognised by the government, which has set a target of growing rail freight by 75% by 2050.</p> <p>However, despite these targets, Smith feels policies still benefit road freight more than rail. He points to fuel duty, which has been frozen since 2011, as a prime example.</p> <p>“Over the last five years, what we pay for fuel and track access charges, the cost of our wagons has gone up by 25%, while fuel duty hasn’t gone up at all,” he says, explaining his trains have to travel at least 200 miles to be able to compete on price.</p> <p>Despite the headwinds UK businesses face, Smith says his company will continue to invest in the business and its fleet, to make it greener and more sustainable and secure its long-term future.</p> <p>“At the end of the day, the diesel locos we use in 20 years’ time, when I’m six foot under, they’re not going to be the mainstay of rail freight,” he says, getting ready for his next meeting. His mode of travel? Rail, of&nbsp;course.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>63<strong><br>Family </strong>Married to Lesia with two sons – Marki and Leksi.<strong><br>Education </strong>Archbishop Holgate’s school, York; mechanical engineering at Loughborough University.<strong><br>Pay </strong>The company’s highest-paid director received £657,000 in salary and performance-related bonuses in 2022, according to company accounts.<strong><br>Last holiday </strong>Mauritius.<strong><br>Biggest regret </strong>Missed attending the 1973 FA Cup victory for Sunderland.<strong><br>Best advice he’s been given </strong>“‘You know it makes sense’, engraved on the inside of my wedding ring.”<strong><br>Words or phrase he overuses </strong>“We are where we are.”</p>",

Some estimates pegged <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/exclusive-report-500-billion-in-damage-and-economic-loss-estimated-after-destructive-and-unprecedented-hurricane-season/1717667\">damage and economic loss</a> at $500bn.</p> <p>Another eye-catching figure is 10m, which is the number of trees the non-profit Arbor Day Foundation (ADF) is planning to plant in six of the worst-hit states over the next four years to replace those destroyed by the major hurricanes Beryl, Debby, Helene and Milton, and other cyclones, in the season that concluded on 30 November.</p> <p>The group says it’s impossible to know exactly how many trees were lost, but the <a href=\"https://www.arborday.org/news/arbor-day-foundation-pledges-10-million-trees-areas-impacted-hurricanes-helene-milton\">restoration program</a> that will be executed in Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with assistance from state and local governments, corporate sponsors, community groups and individual volunteers, will be the most ambitious undertaking of its more than 50-year existence.</p> <p>ADF has worked previously in other affected areas, most recently with partners along Florida’s Gulf coast, Panhandle and in Miami after Hurricanes Irma and Michael in 2017 and 2018 respectively, but nothing on this scale.</p> <p>“The emotion that you see from people when they get to get a tree, to take home to plant, to be an active part of recovery, bringing life and hope and healing back to their neighborhoods and to their community is inspiring,” said Dan Lambe, ADF’s chief executive.</p> <p>“What’s so cool about it is it’s every different part of the community you could imagine, every demographic, every age category. People are just so excited to be contributing to the recovery.</p> <p>“And beyond the emotional side of it, in these cities, these communities and these forests, trees are not a nice-to-have, they are a must-have.</p> <p>“From extreme heat, from biodiversity challenges, and ecosystem challenges to the just broader resilience and readiness for the next storm, trees just do so much for us. So it’s both an emotional and an environmental recovery, and we’re proud to get to be a part.”</p> <p>One of the largest areas of focus will be Florida’s heavily populated Tampa Bay region. Although it escaped direct hits from any of the state’s record-tying three landfalling major hurricanes this year, Debby, Helene and Milton, the storms’ giant wind fields still caused severe impacts.</p> <p>“I was born and raised here, and I’ve never before seen such devastation, so many trees down,” said Debra Evenson, executive director of the Keep Tampa Bay Beautiful environmental group that has partnered with ADF to identify the greatest areas of need and set up a replanting schedule.</p> <p>“They covered the streets. Just on our property, at our office, we probably had five trees down. The devastation was everywhere. It wasn’t just one specific area, it hit all of Tampa Bay, just thousands and thousands of trees.”</p> <p>Evenson’s group can count on more than 25,000 volunteers to assist with the project, which she expects to begin before the end of this year with community giveaways, and ramp up after new year with planting days. Schools, lower-income neighborhoods and community spaces will receive early attention.</p> <p>“It’s like, OK, what type of trees do we want to get? We can plant trees in parks and rights of way, but right now it’s like we really want to give trees to the community to help with the canopy,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s in the community, in people’s homes, where so many were lost. They’re crepe myrtles, live oak and magnolia trees … you don’t really understand everything the trees provide until they’re gone. It’s not just air quality, it’s reducing stormwater runoff, it’s providing shade that regulates temperature. We’re in Florida, it’s 100F sometimes, and it’s like ‘why is my electric bill so high?’</p> <p>“It’s because you’re missing your shade trees now. So these trees will be substantial to the community and help with not just all of that, but the conservation and the natural beauty.”</p> <p>Evenson said bringing fruit trees back to deprived areas would also be a priority.</p> <p>“We go into areas that are food deserts, where they don’t have the funds to replant these types of big trees that grow and give shade and bear fruit. To them, this is life-changing,” she said.</p> <p>Lambe said Asheville, the historic North Carolina city flooded and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/hurricane-helene-asheville-climate-change-nowhere-safe\">torn apart by Hurricane Helene</a>, was another area of great need.</p> <p>“We’ve already been distributing trees with community leaders there, to neighborhoods that are ready to replant,” he said.</p> <p>“It was shocking that a community like Asheville was being impacted by a hurricane, and they don’t have a lot of experience with recovery. We’ve been able to take lessons from elsewhere and remind partners that first of all you take an inventory, do an assessment, don’t rush the restoration.</p> <p>“Do it when it’s right, and know that the Arbor Day Foundation is going to be there to help with those recovery efforts as a long-term commitment, because we want to give confidence to those communities that we’re ready to help.”</p> <p><br></p>",

Investigators said most of the worshippers at the Pentecostal church, which has existed for about 35 years, are Black and African American.</p> <p>Colantonio was charged with buying a pocket lighter as well as gasoline at a local convenience store and then setting several fires right outside Shiloh Gospel Temple. Though it was about 12.10am and Shiloh Gospel Temple was vacant at the time, the fires inflicted damage to the church property.</p> <p>Investigators said the place of worship probably would have been razed had firefighters and police officers not responded as quickly as they did to reports of someone trying to start fires at the church. After authorities <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ri/media/1338651/dl?inline\">zeroed in on Colantonio</a> as a suspect in the case, they searched his home and seized notebooks as well as writings containing the phrases “burn churches down to the ground”, “hunt them down” and “gun everyone down who isn’t white”, among others, Rhode Island’s US attorney Zachary Cunha later <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ri/media/1338766/dl?inline\">said</a>.</p> <p>Federal officials ultimately charged Colantonio with obstruction of the free exercise of religious beliefs; malicious damage by means of fire and two counts of assaulting a federal officer. The assault counts stem from allegations that Colantonio concocted a mixture of feces and urine that he threw at two corrections officers working in the lockup where he was being detained in March pending the outcome of his case.</p> <p>Colantonio faces a sentence of at least five years in prison after a change of plea hearing tentatively scheduled for 7 January. According to court filings that he signed, Colantonio could get a maximum sentence of 56 years in prison – but defendants who plead guilty before forcing prosecutors to try them rarely are given the harshest punishment possible.</p> <p>He could also be fined up to $1m and given three years of supervised release from prison, said the court filings, which confirmed Colantonio’s “intention to enter a plea of guilty”.</p> <p>Colantonio’s attorney, Kara Manosh, could not immediately be reached for comment. The Associated Press reported that Manosh had previously declined comment to the outlet.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>As 2025 begins, how positive you feel about your finances will depend a lot on the stage of life you have reached. Hopes of sharp interest rate cuts have receded as inflation has started to rise again, which is bad news for borrowers but good news if you have money in the bank. The triple lock means a healthy increase in the state pension in April, while other benefits lag behind. Here are some of the important dates to look out for in the first months of the year.</p> <h2>January</h2>    <p><strong>1st</strong> The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/22/average-annual-energy-bill-rise-to-great-britain-january-enegry-price-cap-ofgem\">price cap on household gas and electricity</a> comes into force, and at £1,738 for typical usage it’s 1.2% higher than that for the last three months. The headline figure is for direct debit customers using 2,700 kWh of electricity and 11,500 kWh of gas in a year – if you use more or pay in arrears you will spend more than that. The cap is £190 a year lower than in January 2024, but for many pensioner households the loss of the winter fuel allowance will more than cancel that out.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/28/englands-bus-fare-cap-will-rise-from-2-to-3-in-2025-says-starmer\">cap on bus fares</a> for journeys in England goes up from £2 to £3, where it will be fixed until the end of 2025. The government says that without the cap, which applies to single fares, a bus journey from Newcastle to Middlesbrough would cost £8, while travelling from Leeds to Scarborough would cost £15. The limit does not apply everywhere – Manchester, for example, will retain a £2 cap, while in London fares are capped at £1.75.</p> <p>VAT is now payable on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/dec/31/labours-private-school-tax-plan-strongly-backed-by-public-poll-shows\">private school fees</a>, charged at a rate of 20%. The tax will apply to fees paid in advance since 29 July 2024 if they relate to 1 January 2025 onwards. Schools do not have to pass on the full amount to parents or whoever is footing the bill, but some, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eton-college-fee-increase-labour-vat-b2604513.html\">including Eton</a>, have announced that they will.</p> <p><strong>17th</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jul/19/ofcom-to-ban-inflation-linked-mid-contract-price-rises-on-phones-pay-tv-and-broadband\">ban on inflation-linked mid-contract price rises</a> on phone, broadband and TV comes into force. From this date, the regulator, Ofcom, says contracts must include details of any future price rises in pounds and pence, so that consumers know what to expect from the deal they have signed up to.</p> <p><strong>31st</strong> The deadline for filing self-assessment forms online for 2023-24. Also the deadline for websites to share sales data with HMRC under a new regime designed to pick up people who are trading on platforms such as eBay, Vinted and Airbnb. If you have sold at least 30 items or earned roughly £1,700 in 2024, the platform must give this information to the revenue. You have a £1,000 trading allowance on which you do not need to pay tax, but must declare sales above that. HMRC has an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-to-tell-hmrc-about-your-income-from-online-platforms?utm_source=hmrc_news&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=onlinesellers\">online calculator</a> you can use to find out what, if anything, you will need to pay.</p> <h2>February</h2> <p><strong>1st</strong> New rates of duty on alcoholic drinks come into force. Some were announced in the budget and some were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/06/wine-sellers-campaign-against-looming-alcohol-duty-plan\">announced previously but delayed</a>. Duty on draught products will be cut by 1p, while that on other drinks rises in line with the RPI measure of inflation. Duty on wine will from now on depend on its alcohol content, with higher ABVs (alcohol by volume) attracting more tax.</p> <p><strong>6th</strong> The Bank of England’s first interest rate decision of the year. At the last meeting, in December, the monetary policy committee voted 6-3 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/19/bank-of-england-keeps-uk-interest-rates-on-hold-amid-jitters-over-rising-inflation\">keep the base rate at 4.75%</a>, but economists suggested a quarter-point cut was on the cards for this month.</p> <h2>March</h2>    <p><strong>2nd</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/30/rail-fares-in-england-set-by-government-to-rise-by-inflation-busting-46-in-2025\">Regulated train fares</a> in England go up by 4.6%, while most railcards will increase in price by £5, or 17%. In London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/13/london-underground-fares-to-rise-by-46-per-cent-from-march\">tube fares also rise by 4.6%</a>. The increase in rail fares will affect about half of those available, and is based on last July’s rate of RPI.</p> <p><strong>20th </strong>The second Bank base rate decision of the year. The rate of inflation will be a big factor in the decision – if it has started to fall, there could be a cut, even if there was also one in February.</p> <p><strong>26th</strong> Not a budget but a “spring forecast” from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The statement is not expected to include any tax changes, after she committed to just one fiscal event a year.</p> <p>Sometime this month: council tax bills for 2024-25 should be finalised and announced.</p> <h2>April</h2>    <p><strong>1st</strong> Temporary stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland come to an end, meaning first-time buyers will have to pay tax on homes worth more than £300,000, down from £425,000, and the threshold will apply if the property costs £500,000 or less, down from £625,000. Movers will start paying the tax on any property over £125,000, down from £250,000. Also on this day, the next energy price cap comes into force, and it could be higher than the last. The forecaster Cornwall Insight has predicted it will rise by 3%, to £1,785 a year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/29/bbc-licence-fee-rise-april-inflation\">cost of a TV licence</a> goes up by 2.9%, or £5, to £174.50 a year. A black and white licence now costs £58.50 a year.</p> <p>Council tax bills are likely to go up. The government announced that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/13/labour-confirm-5-cap-on-council-tax-rises-will-remain\">cap on increases would stay at 5%</a>, so the average bill could go up by about £100 a year. From now, councils can charge up to two times the normal rate on second homes if they choose.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/19/water-bills-for-households-in-england-and-wales-to-rise\">Water bills are also increasing</a>, and households could see an average rise of £86 this year alone.</p> <p>Travellers will pay more air passenger duty (APD) on some flights from this date. Short-haul flights in economy will attract the same tax as now, while the tax on economy flights to the US will go up by £2 to £90. APD on business class flights to the US will go up from £194 to £216. More increases will come in April 2026, including increases to the tax on private jet travel.</p> <p><strong>6th</strong> The new tax year starts. Labour has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/18/rachel-reeves-expected-to-extend-stealth-freeze-on-income-tax-thresholds\">maintained the freeze on personal allowances</a>, so more earners will be dragged into the tax net or pay a greater proportion of tax at the higher rate if they have a pay rise coming into effect.</p> <p>The “national living wage” will go up by 6.7% to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/29/national-minimum-wage-to-rise-by-67-from-april-reeves-confirms\">£12.21 an hour</a>, while workers aged 18 to 20 will get a 16% pay rise, to £10 an hour.</p> <p>The state pension will go up by 4.1%, in line with average earnings, as guaranteed by the triple lock. The new state pension will be worth £230.25 a week. Inflation-linked state benefits will rise by 1.7%, after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/16/surprise-fall-inflation-badly-timed-uk-benefit-recipients\">surprise fall in inflation</a> in September.</p>",

The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected outright the warrants for alleged war crimes in Gaza against him and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant, calling them “an antisemitic decision”. The ultranationalist national security adviser, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/reaction-icc-warrants-israeli-hamas-leaders-2024-11-21/\">Itamar Ben-Gvir, declared</a> that the court had shown “once again that it is antisemitic through and through”.

Such claims have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/30/uk-ministers-cobra-meeting-terrorism-threat-israel-hamas-conflict-suella-braverman\">made against protesters</a> crying out for an end to the bloodshed in Gaza and against the UN and aid agencies warning of a humanitarian catastrophe. They have been levelled at global news channels and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/israeli-officials-accuse-international-court-of-justice-of-antisemitic-bias\">international court of justice</a>; against actors, artists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/26/charlotte-church-denies-antisemitism-pro-palestinian-song\">pop stars</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/11/zone-of-interest-international-film-oscar\">British-Jewish film-makers</a>. So sweepingly and speech-chillingly are such claims made by Israel’s diehard defenders that the very term “antisemitism” is losing its meaning. It is exactly as the British-Jewish philosopher <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/myth-new-anti-semitism/\">Brian Klug warned 20 years ago</a>: “When antisemitism is everywhere, it is nowhere.” Blanket misuse has, troublingly, turned the term into a feature on an Israeli politician’s lingo-bingo scorecard.</p> <p>And all this is happening precisely at a time when antisemitism is increasing globally. When Britain’s Jewish community has experienced verbal and physical attacks. When Jewish schools and synagogues have been dealing with death threats and desecrations. In the past 18 months, a <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2023/11/05/global/french-jewish-woman-stabbed-swastika-found-on-her-door\">Jewish woman was stabbed</a> in her home in France, there have been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-jewish-schools-gunshots-9539984e52873b97ac7564810d4bac7f\">shootings at schools in Canada</a> and we saw a full-blown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/mob-storms-dagestan-airport-in-search-of-jewish-passengers-from-israel\">antisemitic riot in Dagestan in Russia</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the far right is taking advantage of the political crisis brought about by Israel’s world-changing war, alternately using actual antisemitism and a pretence of caring about antisemitism to advance its bigoted ideology. For some sections of the far right, antisemitism is the active ingredient powering a racist, migrant- and Muslim-bashing agenda. It echoes the antisemitism that has always been at the core of white supremacism and has made a comeback with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/21/great-replacement-theory-antisemitism-racism-rightwing-mainstream\">the “great replacement” theory</a>: the conspiracy that Jewish people are secretly plotting to flood western countries with people of colour. On the other hand, for resurgent far-right parties across Europe, a performative fight against antisemitism has provided a path to political rehabilitation. Extremist leaders from Hungary’s Victor Orbán to Geert Wilders in the Netherlands present as self-declared champions of Jewish minorities in a supposed <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-european-elections-wilders-le-pen-chega/\">clash of civilisations against Islam</a>.</p> <p>All of these factors – and a few more besides, just to add to the confusion – have collided to turn our conversation on antisemitism into one characterised by accusations and rebuttals, contortions and misunderstandings, bad faith interpretations and endless blind spots. It’s the sort of dissonant mess from which any reasonable person might decide to quietly step away. Because what is the uninvolved onlooker supposed to make of it all? While researching my new book on the subject, several people I spoke to told me they were afraid to even ask about antisemitism, for fear that this might itself be construed as antisemitism. This is another clear sign, if any other were needed, that something has gone badly wrong in the way we talk about the issue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/07/britain-jewish-year-israeli-palestinian\">A year marked by trauma and grief – and questions about what it means to be Jewish in Britain | Dave Rich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Untangling these confusions, I found it was possible to identify distinct themes so that the moving parts of this chaos came into focus. For starters, there is the way that racism is commonly understood as a colour line. While the invention of “black” and “white” is key to understanding the racism that enabled slavery and colonialism and that still inflicts daily harms today, this doesn’t help us to fully comprehend the roots of antisemitism. Studying the histories of racism and antisemitism shows us that one has always influenced the other. The persecution of Jews in the middle ages helped create the architecture of racism that underpinned colonisation and enslavement in the Americas, and reveals how the category of “whiteness” is a fundamentally unstable invention – which is why Jewish people have in the past fallen in and out of it, confusing and intensely irritating racists through the ages.</p> <p>Then there is the grim hypocrisy of our political conversation on antisemitism, which remains hyperfocused on the left. While media cycles spin out over whether the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestine-israel-from-river-to-sea-chant-mean-actually\">chanting of long-used Palestinian slogans</a> constitutes antisemitism, examples of anti-Palestinian hatred from supporters of Israel get waved along. This is not just about the silencing of voices protesting against Israel’s carnage in Gaza – although that is bad enough. If antisemitism is so blatantly wielded as a political weapon, it creates the impression of a fundamental unseriousness about the subject. Dedicating endless column inches to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/17/campus-protest-rules\">campus protests over Gaza</a> is shifting the spotlight, not just away from the devastation in the Palestinian strip, but away from the dangerous antisemitism <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-downplays-right-wing-anti-semitism-contradicting-israeli-study/\">coming from the far right</a>.</p> <p>In her latest book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/09/doppelganger-a-trip-into-the-mirror-world-by-naomi-klein-review-a-case-of-mistaken-identity\">Doppelganger, Naomi Klein</a> writes about the important political issues that have been discarded by the left, only to be opportunistically seized and twisted by the right. So during the pandemic, for instance, people’s reasonable fears about pharma monopolies were commandeered to spew out vaccine conspiracies. The same dynamic now applies to the fight against antisemitism, where the right has strategically filled a space vacated over decades by the left. But far from raising awareness of this ancient prejudice, the right has instead turned the issue into a wedge with which to clobber political opponents: those protesting against Israel’s multiple aggressions and violations of international law, the Black Lives Matter movement, diversity and equity programmes or those grouped together under that catch-all irritant “wokeism”. The effect has been to sow division, derailing progressive movements, thwarting efforts at social, economic and climate justice and helping an increasingly extreme right wing win elections around the world.</p> <p>A true understanding of what has gone so wrong with our discussion of antisemitism – and how to put it right – will not just fortify the left in this urgent political moment. It will also consolidate our antiracist endeavours. It will yield inclusiveness, moral clarity and cohesion. And most of all, it will help us to make sense of the alarming, divisive and destructive rightwards shift of the world – because only then do we stand a chance of changing it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rachel Shabi is the author of Off-White: The Truth About Antisemitism</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>The UK’s economic performance in 2024 was mixed to say the least: while inflation fell below the 2% target in early autumn – and has been outstripped by annual wage growth of 5.2% – it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/18/uk-inflation-hits-eight-month-high-adding-to-pressure-to-hold-interest-rates\">on the rise again</a>. Meanwhile, forecasts for the pace of interest rate cuts have been trimmed and businesses have warned they expect an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/23/sharp-fall-in-uk-business-activity-forecast-cbi-economy\">imminent slowdown in activity</a>. As the year nears its end, people from across the country have shared their financial hopes and concerns for the coming year.</p> <h2>‘I’d love to have a few extra months off with our newborn’</h2>    <p>I’m about to start maternity leave and – after aggressively saving for the last few months – I’m hoping my husband and I have budgeted accurately enough to manage without too much financial stress once my income drops to standard maternity pay (SMP). We’ve made a huge effort to live within our means and pay off any debts, so I’d love to have a few extra months off with our newborn without risking using all of our savings.</p> <p>Even though the government is raising SMP in April by £3 [a week], it’s still less than half of national minimum wage and likely to be approximately £145 per week after tax, national insurance and pension contributions – a big drop from what we’re used to.</p> <p>Given inflation and the extortionate nursery fees I keep hearing about, I’m really worried about having enough to cover the cost of childcare when I go back to work, or the risk of an unforeseen expense forcing me to do so early.</p> <p>For many millennials, it’s just not affordable to have children any more; I know we’re the only couple in our friendship group who want to and are able to. <br><strong>Ashley, 33, a marketing specialist from Leicester</strong></p> <h2>‘Hopefully, I’ll pay off my Covid debt’</h2> <p>I’m hoping to finally pay off the hideous debt load I was put in during Covid. Or move it into “affordable” debt products. To be able to use gas central heating again. To buy a passport. <br><strong>James, a homeowner working in IT, from Birmingham</strong></p> <h2>‘I hope I’ll be able to buy a small home’</h2> <p>I hope that there is a house price crash and that, with the money I have, the purchase of a small home becomes possible – without being tied to the risk of equity extraction and terrifying maintenance charges.</p> <p>My financial concern for next year is that investors will continue to be allowed to buy up smaller houses to trap the less rich in eternal debt to landlords and freeholders.</p> <p>We cannot have a healthy demand economy when so much income goes to housing costs. Nor is it healthy for society for there to be so much homelessness, resentment and bitterness. Building more houses for them to be bought up by extractive investors, both domestic and overseas, will achieve nothing. <br><strong>Rose, retired, from Cornwall</strong></p> <h2>‘Without a promotion, I’ll soon have no juice left’</h2> <p>I desperately need a promotion. I’m happy in my current role but promotion is the only means by which to secure a pay rise that would be even close to covering the increase in the cost of living. Competition is fierce within the ranks of civil servants at delegated grades, as everyone is in the same boat, and there is a distinct lack of decent roles being advertised outside of Whitehall.</p> <p>I worked very hard to secure a sufficient deposit to buy my flat earlier this year, but service charges are a significant worry.</p> <p>After taxes, student loans and essential living costs, I have about £800 disposable income left – £600 after depositing for long-term savings. This year’s public sector pay rise worked out at 5.45% for me. It gave me about an extra £50 a month. But income tax, council tax and utility bill rises, as well as increased student loan contributions, mean that I’m still around £60 per month worse off than this time last year. And this doesn’t even begin to account for other inflationary pressures, or income erosion due to frozen tax bands.</p> <p>I’m beginning to feel like a lemon that’s been squeezed one too many times. If they keep going, I’ll have no juice left. <br><strong>A civil servant from Manchester in his 30s</strong></p> <h2>‘The end of remote working means a costly move’</h2>    <p>I hope to be able to move back to the south, ideally without compromising too much on the quality of the house and neighbourhood.</p> <p>[My concern for next year is that] potential clients are increasingly asking for hybrid or on-site work. My immune system is compromised and I have successfully worked entirely remotely since the pandemic. But it now seems that clients want everyone on site, and this is impacting my ability to earn a living. <br><strong>Andy Hilton, 57, a freelance IT consultant and blood cancer patient from Coventry</strong></p> <h2>‘I worry about Trump’s effect on the global economy’</h2> <p>I’m hoping for reduced interest rates – the mortgage is high enough – and want to look at how I can get more for my money through savings.</p> <p>I’m generally happy with how my finances are, have zero debt outside of mortgage and monthly credit card usage, which is low.</p> <p>My concerns? The effect Trump may have on the global economy with his policy ideas. That the Bank of England gets jumpy about inflation, and adjusts interest rates up. The fact that there appears to be rampant profiteering by utility companies. And the knock-on effect of national insurance increases for employers who will clearly pass that on to us. <br><strong>A 38-year-old paramedic from Leicestershire</strong></p> <h2>‘I hope to secure full-time work to support my family’</h2>    <p>I hope to secure a reliable source of full-time income to cover my bills, meet my student loan payments, and have enough left over to finally begin saving. A little bit of extra income would allow me to buy my four-year-old son a bike he so desperately wants.</p> <p>Graduating in August with an MSc in creative writing will be a huge milestone, and my highest hope is that it spurs me on to have a wonderful career in the literary world that supports myself and my family.</p> <p>The cost of living has made simply feeding my family and meeting rent incredibly difficult. Juggling parenting, university and work is stressful enough, and I spend much of my free time figuring out ways to make ends meet. <br><strong>Rachel, 28, a full-time </strong><strong>master’s student and a part-time barista living in Edinburgh with unsettled status</strong></p> <h2>‘Having to pay for private healthcare affects our retirement planning’</h2> <p>My wife and I both don’t have much of a pension because we spent many years working overseas, in jobs without pension schemes. We do have investments that would be more than enough for a decent retirement, but – medical costs! My wife has had two carpal tunnel ops this year, nearly a grand each. I need another surgery soon that will be close to three grand. Worst of all, she really needs a knee replacement, that’s going to be £15,000. Having to pay for medical treatment [because of untenable waits to be seen on the NHS] blows a huge hole into financial planning.</p> <p>I’m hoping to be able to reduce working hours a bit more, but that depends on whether we can handle the salary drop and whether my employer would permit it. At our age we need more time to look after each other, and we may not have that much time left.<strong> <br>John, 65, a computer scientist from the Isle of Wight</strong></p>",

Beckinsale says she has been “assaulted” and “felt up” on film sets, and was insulted and called “a cunt” and “a bitch” when she complained.</p> <p>Beckinsale says that, while she has never met Lively or Baldoni, she has been “following as a lot of people have, the situation”, and that it highlights “this machine that goes into effect when a woman complains about something legitimately offensive, upsetting, harmful, whatever, in this industry”.</p> <p>In the video, Beckinsale recounts her own negative experiences, saying she has “47 million stories” like this. She says: “At the age of 18, [I was] felt up by somebody that I really trusted on a crew. Went to the lead actress, who’s known for being a supporter of women, and said this has happened and was told, ‘No, it didn’t.’ I went to another actress, crying, and said I’d just been assaulted by this man and again told, ‘No, you haven’t been.’”</p> <p>Lively filed an 80-page legal complaint against Baldoni, alleging inappropriate behaviour during the making of It Ends With Us, as well as a smear campaign against her. Baldoni denies the claims, and says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/30/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-counterclaim\">he is planning to file a counterclaim</a>. Lively’s allegations have attracted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/23/blake-lively-support-lawsuit-justin-baldoni\">wide support from other high profile figures in the industry</a> including Amy Schumer, America Ferrera, Amber Heard and the It Ends With Us author Colleen Hoover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kate Beckinsale instagram\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

And I was harmed, to the point where there were MRIs proving it. And actually what happened was I was gaslit and made to feel like I was the problem, blamed and ostracised … as soon as I mentioned there was a problem.”</p> <p>Beckinsale describes the behaviour of a “drunk” male co-star whose inability to learn his lines caused extensive delays, meaning she was unable to see her young daughter during the shoot. “He’s obviously going through something, and I have full sympathy for that, but … the studio’s response was to give me a bike so I could ride around the studio lot while I was waiting. Then, of course, I was called a cunt and a bitch. At one point during a take, I was called ‘You stupid bitch.’”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/30/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-counterclaim\">Justin Baldoni to reportedly file counterclaim against Blake Lively</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beckinsale also recalls having to deal regularly with body image issues. She had to listen to a group of people saying, in her earshot: “What the fuck are we going to do? How do we make her attractive?” She says she was “put on such a strict diet and exercise programme” that she stopped menstruating. In another instance, she was forced to take part in a photoshoot the day after a miscarriage. “I said, ‘I don’t want to … I am bleeding out a miscarriage’ and [the publicist] said, ‘You have to or you’ll be sued.’”</p> <p>In a lengthy caption to her video, Beckinsale adds: “It is very, very, very easy to foment hatred against actresses, as was seen in the transcripts of conversations … between the publicists and crisis team involved in this case. Complaining about abuse should not beget more abuse, particularly at work where there should be inviolable safeguarding in place, and it should not be expected of women who have been harmed, insulted, hurt, shamed or in any other way abused.”</p> <p>“There are far too many casualties of this, many of whom I know personally, and it really falls to both men and women in our industry to be part of stamping this out for good.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Cori Bush may be leaving Congress this month, but she is determined to stay in the fight for the future of the Democratic party and the direction of the country.</p> <p>Bush, a two-term progressive representative from Missouri who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/07/cori-bush-pro-israel-lobby-warning\">lost her primary race</a> in August amid an onslaught of spending by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), looks back on her four years in the House with pride as she prepares to start a new chapter of her political career.</p> <p>“I’m happy about the work that we’ve done, but also I just feel like there’s just so much more to do, and I just want St Louis to have the best outcome,” Bush said. “I’m keeping the door open to many possibilities, but right now, all I can say is this: I’m not going anywhere. I’m just getting started.”</p> <p>Bush, a member of the progressive “Squad” in the House, made a splash on Capitol Hill from her very first days there. After first gaining attention as an activist and community leader in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014, Bush won a House race on her second attempt in 2020 and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/19/cori-bush-diary-congress-capitol\">sworn in</a> just days before the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Less than a week after the attack, Bush <a href=\"https://bush.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-cori-bush-introduces-resolution-to-expel-members-of-congress-who-sought-to-overturn-election-and-incited-violent-white-supremacist-attack-on-us-capitol\">introduced</a> a resolution to expel Republican members who had supported efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, accusing them of sedition.</p> <p>Seven months later, Bush made headlines again by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/08/cori-bush-interview-eviction-moratorium\">staging</a> a four-day protest on the Capitol steps to extend a pandemic-related moratorium on evictions. One month after that, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/30/congresswomen-personal-abortion-stories-cori-bush-barbara-lee-pramila-jayapal\">testified</a> before the House oversight committee about her decision to have an abortion after she was raped at the age of 17.</p> <p>“We worked really, really hard,” Bush said. “We’ve done some great things, and historic things, in our office in just a very short time, in four years, and I decided to be who I said I would be on the campaign trail, to be that person in Congress.”</p> <p>Bush’s outspoken politics ultimately cost her a seat in the House. In the days after the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, Bush introduced the Ceasefire Now <a href=\"https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bushceasefirenowresolution.pdf\">resolution</a> calling for an end to the war in Gaza. After its introduction, Bush became the target of attack ads from Aipac’s Super Pac, the United Democracy Project (UDP).</p> <p>The Super Pac ran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46mV_c2uBvI\">ads</a> criticizing Bush for voting against Biden’s infrastructure bill and accusing her of failing to deliver for her district. The ads further imperiled Bush, who was already viewed as vulnerable after the justice department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/30/cori-bush-security-money-investigation\">launched</a> an investigation into her potential misuse of campaign funds for security services.</p> <p>In total, UDP spent roughly $8.5m boosting Bush’s primary opponent, the St Louis county prosecutor Wesley Bell, who won the race by 5.5 points in August.</p> <p>With her defeat, Bush became the second Squad member to lose a primary to an Aipac-backed challenger, after Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/25/new-york-democratic-primary-jamaal-bowman\">lost his race</a> to fellow Democrat George Latimer in June. Bush pointed to the two losses as evidence of the need to get dark money out of US elections, and she specifically excoriated Aipac for unseating Black lawmakers. During Bush’s primary, UDP was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/07/31/aipac-cori-bush-attack-photo/\">accused</a> of distributing campaign mailers that distorted her features to lean into racist tropes about Black people.</p> <p>“They made sure that they targeted Black legislators. Let’s just be clear: they targeted with the most money Black legislators, and I think that that was on purpose,” Bush said. “I will say to the Democratic party: we have to do a better job.”</p>    <p>UDP did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Bush framed Aipac’s involvement in Democratic primaries as a deliberate attempt to shift the party’s politics rightward. According to a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/aipac-republican-donors-democratic-primaries-00162404\">Politico analysis</a>, Aipac served as the largest source of Republican money into competitive Democratic primaries this year.</p> <p>“I need Democrats to pay attention to the fact that what they’re really doing is they’re trying to move Democrats to the right,” Bush said. “And so they’re not going to stop with us.”</p> <p>Aipac’s ability to pour millions of dollars into Democratic primaries underscores the threat of dark-money groups, Bush argued. She implored Democrats, specifically progressive lawmakers, to reject donations from corporate special interest groups.</p> <p>“I don’t take corporate Pac money. We are 100% grassroots funded. So I can’t be bought by anyone,” Bush said. “In this democracy, we should not be able to buy elections. … We do need to get the corporate money completely out of our elections. And it has to start with our leadership.”</p> <p>The push to get corporate money out of politics could play a role in Bush’s next career move after Congress, but for now, she is making the most of her final days as a House member. She has joined forces with Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a fellow Squad member, to urge Joe Biden to direct the US archivist to certify and publish the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as the 28th amendment to the constitution.</p> <p>“So much is housed under the Equal Rights Amendment. So we’re talking about closing the gender wage gap, actual protections as it relates to violence against women, sexual discrimination and harassment in the workplace,” Bush said. “This is the time.”</p> <p>The campaign to certify the ERA faces significant legal hurdles. Earlier this month, the US archivist released <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2025/nr25-004#:~:text=Court%20decisions%20at%20both%20the,publish%20the%20Equal%20Rights%20Amendment.\">a statement</a> reiterating that courts had determined the ratification deadline had passed for the ERA, so the office could not legally publish it.</p> <p>Despite the challenges ahead, Bush sounded energized as she prepared to fight for progressive policies beyond Congress.</p> <p>“I’ll continue to work to increase the minimum wage, housing justice, economic justice, police accountability, all of the things,” Bush said. “I was on the outside, then went inside, and now I will be going back outside, so I will be able to take that knowledge with me, and those connections.”</p> <p>She hopes her ongoing efforts may serve as an inspiration for young progressives, many of whom feel dismayed and disillusioned over Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House.</p> <p>“Let’s turn that pain into purpose. Let’s turn that discouragement into greater work. Because what we cannot do is shrink,” Bush said. “The fight for the next four years started already. We should already have our eyes on who’s going to be president in four years. And so those talking points, that messaging, that change needs to happen right now.”</p>",

Data from the insurer Direct Line suggested dog thefts had increased by 6% between 2022 and 2023, with English and French bulldogs – regularly sold for about £3,000 – among the most frequently targeted breeds.</p> <p>Separate data from Petlog, one of the UK’s largest lost and found pet databases, revealed that almost 5,000 dogs and more than 20,000 cats were reported missing between January 2023 and June 2024.</p> <p>And while pet theft is booming, so too is the pet recovery industry, with bereft owners increasingly turning to specialists to help reunite them with their missing animals. Some recruit the services of volunteers, while others will pay hundreds of pound for professionals such as Butcher, an ex-Scotland Yard detective, to hunt for their lost or stolen pets.</p> <p>Some detectives – amateur and professional – use an arsenal of the latest technology, including thermal imaging drones and cellular outdoor cameras.</p>    <p>But Butcher relies on old-fashioned detective work and his 10-year-old working cocker spaniel. Together, the pair have recovered hundreds of pets.</p> <p>“I could work every single day of the week and every weekend there’s so much demand right across the board,” he said. “I probably get about on average 15 emails or calls just on missing cats every single week, a busy week might be as many as 30.”</p> <p>His successful recovery rate for cats is somewhere between 82% and 85%. And his work has taken him across the world, tracking down a yorkshire terrier who went missing on the Grenadian island of Carriacou, and investigating a corrupt dog rescue centre in Turkey.</p> <p>Often he recovers the animals within a day – he found a snatched cavapoo by tracking down CCTV, noticing an identifiable sticker in the window of the offending car, and putting out an appeal leading to the too-hot-to-handle dog being found dumped shortly after.</p> <p>In order to address growing calls to tackle the problem, last year the previous government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/24/pet-thieves-could-be-jailed-for-up-to-five-years-under-new-uk-law\">introduced the Pet Abduction Act</a>, creating specific offences of dog and cat abduction in England and Northern Ireland, and introducing compulsory microchipping.</p> <p>But Butcher said it had not helped to address the problem, with police forces still failing to dedicate resources to pet-related crime.</p> <p>Today, he and Molly are looking for Clemmie, a mackerel tabby who disappeared after breaking free from her carrier on a visit to the vet about a month ago.</p> <p>After the death of her partner, retired foreign correspondent Gill Ross, 78, adopted two cats from Cyprus, who she named Winston and Clemmie, after the Churchills.</p>    <p>After Winston was killed in a road accident, Ross said, “Clemmie and I went on together, and she became the most beautiful cat.</p> <p>“She was this little feral thing, but she’s absolutely beautiful and just the best pet, and on down days she’d always sit on my lap every evening, so there’s this big space on my lap now, and it’s just the saddest thing.</p> <p>“I really, really want her back.” </p> <p>A friend found Butcher on the internet, Ross said, adding: “I honestly didn’t think I was going to get to see him, because I know how busy [he is] and how many people want his services.”</p> <p>When she hid part of Clemmie’s scratching post in the garden for Molly to find on their first visit, Ross said, “it was quite incredible”.</p> <p>“Colin took her out into the garden, and about 10 seconds later she was flat down, mission accomplished.”</p> <p>While Ross has collected information from members of the public responding to her missing posters, Butcher and Molly are now out following up on leads; searching for Clemmie’s scent to assess whether sightings of grey cats in the area could be her, and knocking on doors to eliminate cases of mistaken identity.</p> <p>Butcher also encouraged Ross to walk home from the area Clemmie had last been seen – and a week after the Guardian joined him on the hunt, the errant cat did indeed return home.</p> <p>“The owner’s scent and the sound of their voice will act as two positive stimuli to encourage the cat to move in the same direction,” he said. “This is why cats often arrive back at their home a few hours after their owner has been searching for them.”</p> <p>Butcher also helped Becky Taylor, 52, who runs the Haven equine-assisted therapy centre in the West Sussex countryside, to recover her dog Hazel a working cocker cross taken from near her premises.</p> <p>“It was absolutely horrific,” Taylor said. “All I could do was just believe I was going to get her back, because I would lose it if I didn’t.</p> <p>“It’s really horrific, because dog owners with stolen dogs get the most awful phone calls, people saying they’ve got their dog, they’re going to kill it, if you don’t give them some money now.”</p>    <p>Taylor spent months putting up posters, scouring selling sites, and investigating every possible lead – turning to Butcher for support and advice.</p> <p>“The police weren’t interested, and I just thought, you know, I really am on my own,” she said.</p> <p>Eleven months later, after receiving a phone call with information, she found out that Hazel was being kept on a puppy farm. “I had to buy her back,” she said. “I needed her back and I was willing to pay.”</p> <p>She added: “She hadn’t got a microchip in, they cut it out. She had obviously been shut away in the dark, she had just had puppies. She had obviously been on a puppy farm.</p> <p>“Her nose was burnt where she hadn’t been able to get away from the heat lamp. She was still producing milk, she had a fever, she was quite thin and very smelly.”</p> <p>Taylor said the new legislation would not have helped return Hazel to her, and said a national DNA database kept alongside microchip details, and stricter regulation of breeders, was needed.</p> <p>“The dog’s DNA can’t be changed,” she said. “If that dog gets stolen, and for example, if it’s a bitch that goes on to be bred, then the DNA from the puppies would match.</p> <p>“If you had to produce ID, your name and address, before you could put an advert up then things could be tracked back to that person and you wouldn’t get the same person being able to breed time and time again under different names.”</p>    <p>Butcher said: “The Tories introduced a piece of legislation that isn’t really fit for purpose,” adding that getting to grips with pet theft should be a priority because “without a doubt” it is often linked to more serious crime.</p> <p>“One of the main reasons dogs are stolen is to sell them into the illegal breeding network,” he said. “You can invest a large sum of money from say, the sale of narcotics into building a illegal breeding network, so a puppy mill operation.”</p> <p>And meanwhile, the impact on owners left missing their pets can be devastating.</p> <p>“It’s not about just taking someone’s possessions,” Taylor said, “it’s about taking a member of their family, and it’s just the most horrific thing.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Each day, bowls are set down on the ground in a line outside the community kitchen in Sururab, 25 miles north of Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, for the 350 families who eat here. Community kitchens like these have been crucial to <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/almost-two-dozen-countries-at-high-risk-of-acute-hunger-un-report-reveals\">staving off famine in Sudan</a> over a year and a half of a war that has <a href=\"https://www.unrefugees.org/news/sudan-crisis-explained/\">displaced 11.5 million people</a>, and is part of a system of ground-level mutual aid that has provided key relief where foreign aid has been scarce.</p> <p>While community kitchens feed, other necessities and support are provided by organisations called Emergency Response Rooms, which are often neighbourhood-based. The Sudanese diaspora has also helped, by fundraising for these grassroots efforts or providing medical advice through telemedicine services.</p> <p>Mazin Alrasheed helped set up the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mazinalzain/p/DATSebXoc8g/?locale=ru&amp;hl=am-et\">community kitchen in Sururab</a> only weeks after war broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries.</p>    <p>Those first weeks saw the residents of Khartoum and its adjoining cities of Omdurman and Bahri scrambling to places such as Sururab, and more keep coming, including 130 families who recently arrived after escalated fighting in Gezira state, south of the capital.</p> <p>“Most of the people I’ve met depend on this meal we provide. The majority of them have no income and have been displaced because of the war. Almost 50% of the families we serve live in IDP camps in the area,” says Alrasheed of the camps for internally displaced people.</p> <p>“International organisations’ efforts are beneficial but they often come at irregular intervals and sometimes face distribution issues,” he says, also pointing to administrative problems that beset large organisations.<em><strong> </strong></em>“For instance, flour distributed in late September had an expiry date in October. Also, some families received impractical amounts, leading them to sell the extra.”</p> <p>The fighting has not only displaced millions, but caused significant damage to infrastructure, including <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/12/26/YHRL_SAPA_KhartoumReport_FINAL.pdf.crdownload\">to nearly half of Khartoum’s hospitals.</a> Getting aid – whether food, water or medicine – can also be difficult because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/13/sudanese-factions-using-starvation-as-weapon-is-cowardice-us-envoy-says\">warring forces block</a> its delivery to certain areas.</p>    <p>Sudan has a longstanding tradition of neighbourly support and generosity, but the sense of solidarity within communities was strengthened during the protest movement that began in 2018 to oust the president, Omar al-Bashir.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/17/uk-aid-budget-to-sudan-set-to-double-amid-famine-fears\">UK aid budget to Sudan set to double amid famine fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neighbourhood-based groups called resistance committees would organise protests as well as provide support to their neighbours, continuing their efforts when Bashir was replaced by an alliance of the SAF and RSF, until the two forces began fighting each other.</p> <p>A similar dynamic has emerged since the war began through the creation of Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs), which, like the community kitchens, have cropped up across Sudan, providing food, medicine, water and shelter. They also document violence and try to secure more support from abroad.</p> <p>“The profound sense of mutual aid among Sudanese communities is deeply inspiring and humbling. It reflects the incredible strength, resilience, and compassion of the Sudanese people, even in the face of unimaginable hardship,” says Haitham Elnour, a member of the Sudanese diaspora who supports the ERRs.</p>    <p>He says they have filled a gap left by the war’s destruction of governance and infrastructure.</p> <p>Leena Badri, a member of the <a href=\"https://sudansolidarity.com/\">Sudan Solidarity Collective</a>, which fundraises among the diaspora, says that the efforts and voices of people on the ground need to be highlighted.</p> <p>“These are the people working to sustain people in Sudan. They are the voices that need to be centred. They are the first responders, it’s as simple as that,” she says.</p> <p>The collective has helped support civilian-led relief efforts in at least 12 of Sudan’s 18 states. Badri says the goal is not to tell them how to use the funds but to take advice from local people on what is needed.</p> <p>She says the role of relief groups, whether community kitchens or ERRs, has been crucial because both sides of the conflict have placed restrictive conditions on aid groups that prevent them from operating freely.</p> <p>“They become prisoner to one side’s demands. But with something like aid you can’t do that, you can’t restrict it to one area or another. The ERRs don’t side with anyone, they serve their community,” says Badri.</p>    <p>The impact of these efforts in Sudan is now attracting attention and support from the wider humanitarian sector. In September, major charitable foundations <a href=\"https://disasterphilanthropy.org/resources/coalition-for-mutual-aid-in-sudan/#:~:text=The%20Coalition%20is%20a%20group,Bill%20%26%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation\">pledged $2m</a> (£1.6m) to provide grants for local aid efforts by the end of the year.</p> <p>Elnour says the resilience and resourcefulness of the Sudanese in supporting each other through the war shows how localised aid can be more suited to the culture and context and more efficient than major international operations.</p> <p>“Watching Sudanese individuals and groups take charge of their own destiny through localised, community-driven approaches reaffirms the power of self-determination,” he says. “This approach does more than address immediate needs – it helps to cultivate a generation of youth and volunteers who are actively engaged in problem-solving, coordination, and service delivery.”</p>",

No distractions from the pursuit of the Premier League title, was the gist of his message, along with no firm updates on the Anfield futures of Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander‑Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. It was always thus. Privately, however, Slot could be forgiven for feeling irritated and asking pertinent questions of his own about how Liverpool allowed this unnecessary sideshow to develop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/29/west-ham-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Salah stars as Liverpool rout West Ham to move leaders eight points clear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No distractions? Liverpool maintained their almost flawless title challenge with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/29/west-ham-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">5-0 away win</a> and both Slot and Salah were,&nbsp;inevitably, asked for contract&nbsp;updates after the game. Alexander-Arnold appeared to reference the talk over a possible move to Real Madrid with his goal celebration during it. Slot is correct in his assertion that internally and out on the pitch, where it matters most, the uncertainty has not distracted Liverpool from their primary objective. Given the outstanding form of the three players in question, it could be argued the prospect of being out of&nbsp;contract at the end of this season&nbsp;has had a galvanising effect.&nbsp;But that is not to make a positive out of a saga that has too often detracted from Slot’s outstanding debut season.</p> <p>Liverpool have a well-established reputation for sound business practice and succession planning. Slot’s appointment is the latest supporting evidence. Yet&nbsp;on Wednesday three world-class players at the forefront of the club’s assault on the Premier League, Champions League and Carabao Cup, who should be worth – what? – more than £200m in transfer fees combined, will be able to sign pre-contract agreements to join a foreign club on a free transfer in the&nbsp;summer. It would be bad practice to lose one. Even if all three commit their long-term futures to Anfield, Liverpool’s strategy would still look needlessly high-risk, although that would be quickly forgotten and forgiven.</p> <p>Liverpool are, of course, negotiating three lucrative and complex individual contracts, not with one collective bargaining unit. Salah turns 33 at the end of his current £350,000-a-week (minimum) deal. Van Dijk will be 34&nbsp;in July. Alexander-Arnold is wanted by the European champions. Three reasons for three separate hold-ups right there.</p>    <p>There are other mitigating circumstances for Liverpool’s delay. The club’s entire football hierarchy has been through a period of upheaval over the past two years, from Julian Ward’s surprise decision to step down as sporting director in November 2022 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/12/michael-edwards-agrees-liverpool-return-to-oversee-post-klopp-era\">Michael Edwards’ return</a> in the new role of chief executive of football at Fenway Sports Group in March this year. With the seismic matter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/26/jurgen-klopp-to-step-down-as-liverpool-manager-at-end-of-season\">Jürgen Klopp’s departure</a> in between. And Richard Hughes’s arrival as the new sporting director tasked with appointing the right man to succeed a club legend. There was bound to be a knock-on effect for player contracts.</p> <p>From the trio’s perspective, there may have been a desire to wait and see whom Liverpool appointed as Klopp’s successor, and then to assess his work, before committing to talks on a new deal. That would certainly make sense in the case of Salah, whose relationship with Klopp towards the end of last season was not exactly conducive to extending a phenomenal Liverpool career. That excuse no longer exists. Nor does the Salah claim, volunteered one month ago, that he was “more out than in” at Liverpool due to not receiving a new contract offer. An offer has been made since but, according to the Egypt international, a resolution remains “far away”. The same applies to the captain, Van Dijk.</p> <p>The elder statesmen of the team have made it clear they wish&nbsp;to stay. For how long and for how much is yet to be revealed, but Liverpool must find a way to bring the impasse to an end. The pair’s influence on and off the pitch and their numbers – not those on a birth certificate – demand it. Salah’s goal and two assists at West Ham took him to 17 and 13 in total respectively in 18 Premier League games. It is the fastest any player has reached 30 goal involvements in a single Premier League season. He has also maintained his remarkable record of scoring at least 20 goals in all eight seasons as a Liverpool player. Van Dijk has been imperious in a defence that has been disrupted frequently by injury yet has kept 13 clean sheets&nbsp;in 27 matches and conceded only 17 league goals.</p> <p>Alexander-Arnold’s situation is different, and not merely on account of age profile. On Tuesday it emerged that Real Madrid had approached Liverpool to sign the full-back in January but that the move was turned down. It is also understood the England international has not yet given Liverpool an indication that he wants to leave. Talks between the two parties are continuing, as the Liverpool head coach stated after the Boxing Day defeat of Leicester. But Alexander-Arnold knows he has a high-profile, life-changing option available should he decide to part company with his boyhood club after 20 years. Decision time is approaching, but Slot does not need nor deserve the sideshow.</p>",

Virtually all art on Strava, the popular app used by athletes to record the details of their workouts, comprises a single, at times immensely detailed, frame.</p> \n<p>McCabe’s contribution to the genre was in making something that moved – or in this case, danced.</p> \n<p>The video, set to the beat of Purple Hat by Sofi Tukker, has the stick figure dancing and shuffling along the streets of Toronto’s West End – a feat that involved 1,100km of running. Every second of the video is a marathon and a half. The idea, which plays out like a flip book, came from his wife, Andrea Morales.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3cded464-722e-4dbe-b575-d8aa91446e9b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rv1U6Lw6-XA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“I love working with video. And over the years I’ve come to appreciate that one of the most powerful and underused tools is the passage of time,” he said. “And motion is just time unfolding.”</p> \n<p>The stick figure wasn’t McCabe’s first attempt at Strava art. Last year, he made a collection of blocky animals by running through the city’s streets. He admits they were amateurish, but served as a useful exercise in learning both the quirks of Strava and the level of fastidiousness needed to execute a grander vision.</p> \n<p>Initially, the now-famous TikTok post went unnoticed, racking up dozens of views in the first few days.</p> \n<p>“The reality is you have to go into these things assuming that they’ll fall flat, that they’ll fail.”</p> \n<p>It was only after Ben Steiner, a Toronto-based sports journalist, reposted<a href=\"https://x.com/BenSteiner00/status/1859712317996597433\"> McCabe’s video</a> that a broader audience took notice.</p> \n<p>In the weeks since, he’s appeared on daytime talkshows, waded through a frenzy of media interviews and emerged with a level of virality that has exceeded anything he imagined would be possible. With that level of internet fame, he now occupies a rare space few creatives ever attain: a chance to build on success and to address the ever-lingering question of what comes next. The whale, run on a recent December morning before sunrise, is part of that answer.</p> \n<p>Holding a detailed map on his phone in one hand and a 360-degree camera in another, he jogs up and down the quiet pre-dawn streets, past the clatter of road construction and at times, dodging incoming traffic.</p> \n<p>“If I let Strava plan this route out for me, it would put me at crosswalks. That doesn’t work for something like a whale.”</p> \n<p>Occasionally, he abruptly stops and begins walking, the secret for the most controversial element of his famed dancing stick figure: the diagonal lines.</p> \n<p>It’s the question he’s asked most online: how did he pull off this impossible feat, in a city laid out on a grid, without cutting through yards or even through entire buildings? McCabe uses a quirk of Strava whereby if a user pauses the run, and then moves to another location, the program smooths out the route using a straight line.</p> \n<p>But his explanation isn’t enough to satisfy a minority of armchair internet contrarians.</p> \n<p>“They say that instead of running four times a week, I flew a drone, lied to my friends and family in the hopes that a novel idea takes off,” he said. “Because that’s oddly more satisfying than accepting I just ran a lot for a long time.”</p> \n<p>Instead, he wishes viewers had noted the deliberate subtleties of the animation, including when the stick figure struts along the screen – a feat that required shifting the whole piece further and further away from his home.</p> \n<p>When it came to assembling the video, McCabe had to fiddle with the smallest details, including dozens of stray lines and frame rates. The resulting art, in a way, comes in spite of – not because of – the programs used to create it.</p> \n<p>Art and running both require propulsive internal force to complete. For McCabe, it was a vision in his head – of a dancing stick figure – he couldn’t shake. “It’s simple, I know it sounds silly, but I got goosebumps thinking about what it could be.”</p> \n<p>There were days he was soaked through from torrential downpours. When he needed to access his phone to see the route, he realised wet fingers can’t operate a touch screen. “You find yourself praying you can find a bit of dry sock to maybe clear a bit of the screen,” he says. “Or else you just spent the last hour for nothing.”</p> \n<p>For 10 months, he toiled alone. “I was doing this with no feedback. All I had was my wife. I’d come home and she’d ask how my stick man was, and I’d tell her: ‘Oh, tonight was a great stick man.’”</p> \n<p>His online fame, however, has not brought him many tangible rewards.</p> \n<p>“I thought brands would want to reach out and maybe want to be a part of this,” he said. “All I’ve got is a pair of shoes and a few protein bars.”</p> \n<p>Even with all the miles logged, McCabe doesn’t think of himself as a runner. “I don’t have a fancy kit. I don’t go fast. If anything, running is just a way of making the art.”</p> \n<p>The sun has risen, the streets are growing busier and McCabe is nearly done with the whale. He’s working through the lower pectoral fin. When he can, he edges towards patches of greenery.</p> \n<p>“I like to avoid the sharp turns when I can. I love the lazy, meandering angles, especially on something like a whale. Not everyone will notice it. Most won’t,” he said. “But, I do.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Let’s start with an impression. Move towards the window, shake your fist and yell “Aaaaargh”. Then “Waaaaaaaah!” Now scream “Grrrrrrrrrrrr … I don’t believe it”. Well done, that’s the cry of the rightwing Tory/Reformite bird today, reacting to the news that London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/30/sadiq-khan-stephen-fry-and-emily-thornberry-make-new-year-honours-list\">has received a knighthood</a>.</p> <p>We all do it a bit. There never was an honours list to delight everyone. The very fact of an honours list annoys very many people and that’s fair enough, because the system is heroically flawed in terms of who gets them, how the recipients are chosen and what they are called (congratulations to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/ken-mccallum\">Ken McCallum, director of MI5</a> – you’re now <a href=\"https://www.paradata.org.uk/decoration/knight-commander-order-bath-kcb\">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a>).</p> <p>But Khan is the focus of consternation. “Sadiq Khan is knighted as Keir Starmer hands out ‘reward for failure’,” <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14237557/Keir-Starmer-Sadiq-Khan-knighthood-New-Years-Honours.html\">says the Mail</a>. “Starmer knights Sadiq Khan in ‘reward for failure’,” <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/30/new-year-honours-list-sadiq-khan-gareth-southgate/\">says the Telegraph</a>. If they sound similar, that’s because both are parroting the whining of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/chris-philp-mp\">Chris Philp</a>, Kemi Badenoch’s shadow home secretary. He is a man whose stature would easily allow him to enter the Commons through a political catflap, but no matter – he’s against Khan and his media hitmen hate Khan, so today, they fly in tandem.</p> <p>What’s this about, you may ask. Is Khan the least-deserving person ever to profit from this flawed system? That can’t be so. In 2014, David Cameron’s barber <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/06/david-cameron-barber-mbe-services-hairdressing\">was awarded an MBE</a> in the new year honours list for “services to hairdressing”, and the raging Tory bird stayed silent.</p> <p>There’s strategy here. Look at the other headline names. Stephen Fry gets a knighthood. Good for him, he’s a national treasure in many ways: a whole generation of parents will thank him, for example, for enchanting and soothing their children with his masterly readings of the Harry Potter books. The Tory bird gains no advantage attacking him.</p> <p>Then there is Gareth Southgate, now Sir Gareth. The Tory bird pecked at him a while back, framing a narrative that the then England football manager was far too woke, with all his embracing of multiculturalism and taking the knee. But that didn’t go so well and darn it if he didn’t take a perennially overexpectant, underperforming, afraid-of-its-own-shadow England to two major finals and a semi-final. So as a potential, headline-grabbing target for the Tory bird, he’s best left alone.</p> <p>In another world, it might be aggrieved about the knighthood bestowed on Ranil Jayawardena, who served briefly as environment secretary under Liz Truss, who – as we know – served as briefly herself in No 10 as the time it takes to burn a match. But he’s a Tory, so no mileage there.</p> <p>And so to Khan, who is in his third term running the capital city as mayor, and gets the same honour as the Tory Andy Street, who served two terms running the West Midlands.</p> <p>Khan is a kind of nut feeder for the Tory bird. He’s Labour, of course, and he annoys all the Londoners who want to drive their cars and vans where they like, whenever they like, by saying that they can’t. He’s quite the bore with his mania for cleaner air and imposition of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) that seeks to facilitate it.</p> <p>And, of course, he’s Muslim. That fact alone seems enough to irk a certain kind of Tory/Reformite bird, and in terms of political campaigning it dog-whistles well, if not particularly effectively. Tories have deployed the culturally “othering” strategy against Khan during and prior to London elections fought by Zac Goldsmith (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/zac-goldsmith\">now Lord Goldsmith</a>) and then the noxiously absurd culture warrior <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/what-london-assembly-does/london-assembly-members/susan-hall\">Susan Hall</a> – and twice they have lost.</p> <p>The charges against Sir Sadiq, as we can style him now, span an alleged failure to tackle knife crime, congestion charge pricing and rises in council tax. Make of that what you will. But also consider independent analysis that finds more toxic air pollution has been averted by Ulez than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/28/london-ulez-averts-more-air-pollution-than-that-caused-by-capitals-airports-report-shows\">is produced by the capital’s airports or its river and rail transport combined</a>; that, according to more independent research, Ulez, so hated by the Tory bird, has “<a href=\"https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/low-emission-zones-improve-air-quality-health-and-peoples-well-being-new-ipr-policy-brief/\">significantly improved air quality</a>”. Against the backdrop of a politics that struggles to achieve tangible change or – as politicos say – “delivery”, that’s a significant public service achievement.</p> <p>Khan has rolled out free school meals for every state primary school child in London, while people are raving about the Elizabeth line and its transformative potential for the capital. None of this is perfect, nor is his mayoralty. Compared to the razzmatazz of the Ken Livingstone/Boris Johnson years, his approach has been subdued. But it has also been largely effective, which Johnson’s squat at City Hall clearly wasn’t.</p> <p>If the Tory/Reformite bird had any instinct to judge this fairly, it might even consider that Khan, because of his background, because of all the culture warring, because of all the death threats, is one of the very few public servants we have obliged to live his life and do his job in the shadow of a continuous police detail that ensures no souped-up lame-brain reacts to all the accumulated animosity with an attempt to kill him.</p> <p>If we are going to give out honours, that alone seems like public service worthy of communal recognition. The rage of the Tory bird, lurking at the window, is neither here nor there.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hugh Muir is the Guardian’s executive editor, Opinion</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>Time is elusive: there are entire years where nothing seems to happen, and then a day comes by where it feels as though everything happens at once. I’ve listened to conversations over the last few weeks about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/31/resolution-revolution-how-to-make-new-year-promises-that-you-will-stick-to\">resolutions and goals</a> – people want to effect change, measure their progress in targets achieved over months. This time last year, I had every intention of making 2024 add up to something substantial. But the vague futility of that human urge to make every calendar year “count” was laid bare. Nothing much happened.</p> <p>I’ve since concluded that 2024 was a “filler year”. To me, this type of year is best understood by what it isn’t: a “big year”. In the latter, you might check off a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/26/bucket-lists-are-they-good-idea\">bucket-list milestone</a>. A serendipitous meeting with a future partner could change the course of your life. You could start your dream job, or take on a new role as a parent or godparent. Conversely, a big year could be shaped by profound loss or a random cruelty that redefines who you are. In comparison, a filler year feels empty, insubstantial, unmemorable.</p> <p>Why was 2024 a filler year? I’d love to tell you. It wasn’t for lack of trying to make it a landmark 12 months. I worked, rested and had plenty of goals to reach, but the harder I tried to attain them, the more they seemed to elude me. I was caught in a developmental Chinese finger trap. I didn’t achieve anything notable in my personal, professional or financial life. Time had other ideas for how I should spend it, and this, coupled with an economic crisis that means I’m working harder for less reward, determined that I would not progress, would not pass go, and did not collect £200.</p> <p>I could give you a few reasons for why this happened – the industries I work in are in ill health, friends have been busy with big life changes – but I reckon these are less significant than the underlying psycho-spiritual state that a filler year seems to indicate. The sensation of treading water felt like a necessary adjustment, and I came to realise that I don’t always need to be in motion. The more I leaned into the stasis of 2024, the more I begrudgingly accepted it. If anything was going to happen, it would be on the clock of some external force. I began to experiment with the idea that I don’t need to compel anything to happen, which became, in its own way, a revelation.</p>    <p>To be clear: a filler year needn’t be a waste of precious time. I found that such a year can actually bring unexpected advantages. Rather than a breakup or monumental fuck-up prompting horrifying realisations that lead to personal growth, I learned and grew more slowly. Each small shift in my awareness felt pleasant and subtle. I was only ill once or twice. I was almost never tired, probably because I wasn’t burning all my energy. I read some books, watched some TV, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/21/dear-diary-how-keeping-a-journal-can-bring-you-daily-peace\">journaled a lot</a>. I had the space for leisure time – personal time – in a way I’ve never allowed myself before. What initially seemed like achieving nothing in fact amounted to spending quality time with family and friends. One long weekend I stayed with my aunt and uncle and their children. We spent unstructured evenings drinking wine, chatting, flipping through their interior design books for inspiration on how to decorate my flat. Why don’t we do this more, we all said. The answer, obviously, is that we’re usually too busy.</p> <p>I finally got on top of casual life admin – food shops at big Sainsbury’s, flatpack furniture constructed, exercise routines completed. As a result, I’m now semi-organised and feel mentally stronger, more able to tackle the year ahead. On those small, tedious days, I felt grateful for a warm bed, a meal I’d cooked myself, a great book or conversation with a friend, without having to write about it in a gratitude journal. My only regret is that I didn’t spend more time offline. That expanse of in-real-life nothing became a vacuum that content could fill, and I spent too many hours scrolling through apps.</p> <p>When I described my filler year to my sister the other day, she didn’t get it. She’s not quite as internet-brained as me (though she did just have an extremely<em> “</em>filled”<em> </em>year, having just returned from travelling). “You don’t have to be achieving stuff all the time,” she said. “What you’re talking about, that<em> </em>is just life.” And I suppose she’s right. Did our grandma feel pressure to “level up” each year, to grow hotter, wealthier, more successful, healed and happier while on her linear march towards death? No, she spent her time repotting plants in her garden, and was inspired by the occasional opportunity to take a cooking class or buy a new beret. Life occurred during what I might have previously been inclined to call her many “filler” years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/23/how-to-choose-new-years-resolution\">How to choose a new year’s resolution, according to clinical psychologists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the phrase is flawed; perhaps what seems like “filler” is in fact the substance of a meaningful life. These periods are about learning the experience of simplicity – a quiet year spent with the people and activities we care about, rather than narrowly focusing on achievements or advancement that prove to the world we’re worthy of love. In retrospect, 2024 definitely taught me to be less driven by results. I’m ending this year having recuperated for an upcoming busy period, which will inevitably come at some point. When a friend now asks me for a life update, I’d be happy to tell there’s nothing to report, instead of “Where do I start?”</p> <ul> <li><p>Hannah Ewens is a freelance editor and writer, and the author of Fangirls: Scenes From Modern Music Culture</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>Although there’s a fair amount of seasonally appropriate snow on display, this horror feature represents a stonking slice of counter-programming for the festive season, given there is nothing merry in the least about it. That said, there are sly flashes of tongue-in-cheek humour throughout from married co-writers Aaron Fradkin (also the film’s director) and Victoria Fratz Fradkin (one of the film’s leads). Consequently, Beezel is an impishly nasty machine for jump scares and creepy just-seen imagery using old-fashioned practical effects. It’s not a terribly original work but does create its own toxic, hypnagogic atmosphere.</p> <p>Using a mini-museum’s worth of audiovisual recording technology to capture footage – starting with Super8 and advancing to recent digital cameras – the Fradkins create an episodic work that spans several decades. In the first tranche of storytelling in the 1960s, a woman and her son are killed by a supernatural witch-demon-creature who lives in the basement of an otherwise unremarkable New England tract house. (Apparently the director’s own childhood home served as the location.) Then we jump to the 80s and videographer Apollo (LeJon Woods, underplaying effectively) arrives at the house to record resident Harold Weems (Bob Gallagher, deliciously sinister) as he gives an account of the aforementioned witch, whom he calls Beezel and who killed Weems’s son and previous wife.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz0b8onKkFw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lz0b8onKkFw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>After that episode ends in gristle and gore, it’s on to an early 2000s timeframe wherein hospice nurse Naomi (Caroline Quigley) arrives to look after Weems’s widow Deloris. In a final act, Deloris’s son Lucas (Nicolas Robin) and his wife Nova (Victoria Fratz Fradkin, a hoot) arrive to sell off the manse at last, only to fall prey to Beezel’s dream-haunting, illusion-casting, innocent-torturing shenanigans. The film’s refusal to fill in the backstory and just let the spooky bits work as exercises in tension is both admirable and sort of frustrating, while the musical bed of creaks and drones, credited to the delightfully named Robot Disco Puma, makes for an effective scare workout.</p> <p>• Beezel is on digital platforms from 6 January</p>",

For me to say that and feel that … I realised it was actually affecting me more than I thought. It’s affecting our life, how we go about things.”</p> <p>Hibbert is planning to campaign for a new criminal offence protecting victims of crime or tragedies from harassment by conspiracy theorists, which he wants to be known as Eve’s law after his daughter.</p> <p>He also plans to establish a star chamber of pro-bono barristers who would represent these victims on a no-win, no-fee basis, as he said legal fees were preventing people from suing those hounding them online.</p> <p>Hibbert said the legal bill from his case – which involved a four-day trial at the Royal Courts of Justice – came to almost £250,000, which his law firm is attempting to recoup from Hall.</p> <p>“When we first had a conversation a couple of years ago my barrister said he was going to need £100,000 in an account to even look at this case. Very few, if any, could afford that,” he said. “Why should it be that only people with money can get justice? Eve’s law might also be access to justice.”</p> <p>Hibbert, a former football agent, has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Top-World-Manchester-Kilimanjaro-Wheelchair/dp/180247174X\">published a book</a> about surviving the Arena attack and raising more than £1m for charity after becoming the second paraplegic person to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/13/man-left-paralysed-by-manchester-arena-bomb-conquers-mount-kilimanjaro\">scale Kilimanjaro</a> in 2022.</p> <p>Despite two inquiries and a lengthy criminal investigation into the atrocity, he said his most difficult moment in court was being cross-examined by Hall’s barrister at the harassment trial in July.</p> <p>“It’s probably one of the toughest things I’ve done in life, really,” he said. “I was sat there being made to feel guilty. I was there for three hours and he [the barrister] was saying I have a public profile so I should expect it … It was really hard.”</p> <p>Steyn said in her <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hibbert-v-Hall-Judgment.pdf\">ruling</a> that Hall’s conduct had “alarmed and distressed” Hibbert and caused Eve “real, lasting and persistent anxiety, and enormous distress”.

            "body" : "<h2>We Live In Time</h2> <p>We’re overdue a genuinely good romantic-comedy with a few drops of weepie thrown in. This could be it. Screenwriter Nick Payne and director John Crowley give us a non-smooth-running love story in nonlinear form, in which Florence Pugh’s chef Almut and Andrew Garfield’s breakfast cereal executive Tobias meet cute when Almut runs Tobias over in her car on the day his divorce comes through. <br>• 1 January</p> <h2>Nosferatu</h2> <p>It’s the great cinephile passion-project remake – last undertaken by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski in the title role. Now Robert Eggers has revived FW Murnau’s 1922 silent horror classic as a huge movie event. This time it’s Bill Skarsgård as creepy, emulsion-white Count Orlok – the vampire (based on Dracula) who preys on a delicate Englishwoman played by Lily-Rose Depp. <br>• 1 January</p> <h2>Nickel Boys </h2> <p>This amazingly moving and occasionally scary film, adapted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/26/the-nickel-boys-colson-whitehead-review\">Colson Whitehead’s novel</a>, is about two black American boys sent to a racist and abusive segregated reform school during the Jim Crow 60s (and based on a real institution). The intense and immersive film is shot using first-person point-of-view shots, and its tragedy is at odds with these ecstatic images. <br>• 3 January</p> <h2>A Real Pain</h2> <p>Succession fans in need of a new Kieran Culkin fix will want to see this smart, funny film in which he co-stars with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg. They play Benji and David, two American Jewish guys who take a trip to Poland, home of their forebears, and visit the grim sites of the Holocaust – with their relationship under increasing strain. <br>• 8 January</p>    <h2>Babygirl</h2> <p>Nicole Kidman has form when it comes to representing transgressive age-gap relationships. Here she plays a high-flying CEO who has a thrilling affair with a much younger male intern played by Harris Dickinson. The drama promises to provoke progressive assumptions and question ideas about corporate power dynamics and sexual politics.</p> <p>• 10 January</p> <h2>Maria</h2> <p>Screenwriter Steven Knight and director Pablo Larraín have confected this intense biopic about the final years of the OG diva herself, Maria Callas, played by Angelina Jolie. We begin with her haughty and secluded existence in retirement in Paris, a haunted figure in dark glasses, before flashing back to a childhood in Nazi-occupied Athens and her relationship with Aristotle Onassis<br>• 10 January</p> <h2>A Complete Unknown</h2> <p>A biopic about Bob Dylan is not necessarily going to please all the purists, vinyl connoisseurs and superfans – nor indeed the great Nobel laureate himself. But Timothée Chalamet brings to this role such amazing chutzpah, vivacity, stamina and fun – he sings all the tracks himself – and there’s great stuff from Edward Norton as Pete Seeger. <br>• 17 January</p> <h2>Vermiglio</h2> <p>A gorgeous Italian movie in the manner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/07/ermanno-olmi-obituary\">Ermanno Olmi</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/01/taviani-cinema-or-death\">Taviani brothers</a>, set in a remote wartime village – rich, compassionate, detailed. In the Alpine community of Vermiglio, a schoolteacher has to decide how to react when his eldest daughter falls in love with an army deserter that the villagers are protecting. A lovely film. <br>• 17 January</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG6NoUUhZFo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PG6NoUUhZFo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Emmanuelle</h2> <p>Here is a high-risk movie brand reboot, and Audrey Diwan is the formidable director who has taken it on, as well as co-writing with Rebecca Zlotowski. It’s a remake of the once controversial softcore 70s erotic classic Emmanuelle, reinvented for a sex-positive age. Noémie Merlant plays the title character, who goes on a voyage of steamy erotic discovery in Hong Kong.<br>• 17 January</p> <h2>Here</h2> <p>Richard McGuire’s groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/17/chris-ware-here-richard-mcguire-review-graphic-novel\">graphic novel Here</a> is adapted by Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Eric Roth. We see the family history of Richard and Margaret (played by Tom Hanks and Robin Wright) in a nonlinear style, as the film ranges over everything that has taken place in the part of America where they live – beginning with the dinosaurs. <br>• 17 January</p> <h2>The Brutalist</h2> <p>Brady Corbet’s stunning new film is a brilliant, mysterious epic with something of Orson Welles, Paul Thomas Anderson and Ayn Rand. An architect and Hungarian Holocaust survivor played by Adrien Brody arrives in the US penniless after the war, and is taken under the wing of an impulsive plutocrat played by Guy Pearce, who asks him to design a huge modernist building in tribute to his late mother. <br>• 24 January</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfSNmYhV8Xc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XfSNmYhV8Xc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Presence</h2> <p>That remarkable and restless movie creator Steven Soderbergh returns with a lo-fi psycho-supernatural thriller shot in a single location: a haunted house, where we see things from the point of view of the ghost. A family move into a recently renovated house (Chris Sullivan and Lucy Liu play the mum and dad) and we see their problems from this uncanny standpoint. <br>• 24 January</p> <h2>Hard Truths</h2> <p>Mike Leigh gives us an uncompromising late-career classic: a fierce study of depression performed by Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who last worked with Leigh in Secrets and Lies in 1996. She plays Pansy, a middle-aged woman whose melancholy manifests in a nonstop aria of anger – an uncompromising stream of rage against anyone and anything and everything. It’s a fascinating performance. <br>• 31 January</p>    <h2>The Seed of the Sacred Fig</h2> <p>The fugitive Iranian director and pro-democracy activist Mohammad Rasoulof (who is wanted by the police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/17/exhausting-and-extremely-dangerous-mohammad-rasoulof-on-his-hazardous-escape-from-eight-year-sentence\">in his home country</a>) was unlucky not to win a major award in Cannes for this movie – a drama revolving around a lost gun that spans the real and the surreal. It is about the anguish of its dissenting citizens in a country where women can by judicially beaten and bullied for not wearing the hijab in public.<br>• 7 February</p> <h2>Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy</h2> <p>She’s back. Bridge returns for a fourth film in what can only be called the Bridget Jones franchise, which also plugs into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/02/age-gap-movie-romcoms\">current movie craze</a> for toyboy shenanigans. Renée Zellweger is once again Bridget, whose circumstances are changed and she has a new love: a pert young man played by Leo “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/06/one-day-review-a-flawless-romcom-youll-fall-for-hard-ambika-mod-leo-woodall\">One Day</a>” Woodall. Excitingly, Hugh Grant returns in the role of super-cad Daniel Cleaver. <br>• 13 February</p> <h2>On Falling</h2> <p>This outstanding debut feature from Scotland-based Portuguese film-maker Laura Carreira takes a close look at something that really hasn’t been properly addressed in any art form: the human cost of the online shopping revolution. Joana Santos gives a great performance as a woman who works at a vast fulfilment centre in Scotland, a job that undermines her sanity and humanity. <br>• 7 March</p>    <h2>Julie Keeps Quiet</h2> <p>First-time feature director Leonardo Van Dijl made an impact in Cannes with this very disturbing drama about abuse. Tessa Van den Broeck plays young tennis player Julie, who is poised to become a star. But she and all her contemporaries are stunned by news that her coach is under investigation for something unspecified, and a previous pupil has taken her own life. Should Julie keep quiet? <br>• 7 March</p> <h2>Sister Midnight</h2> <p>Bollywood star Radhika Apte is tearing it up with her deadpan black-comic performance in Karan Kandhari’s much-admired movie. She plays Uma, a young woman from the provinces who arrives in Mumbai to get married, but discovers her husband is a drunk no-hoper and her home is a chaotic mess. <br>• 14 March</p> <h2>Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning</h2> <p>Can it really be true that this is the final Mission: Impossible film? Well, the pressure will be on to go out with a real bang, given that, as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise has consistently delivered solid gold action thrills with his own gasp-inducing stunts – and incidentally established himself as an Anglophile supporter of the UK’s movie industry.<br>• 21 May</p> <h2>The Battle of Baktan Cross</h2> <p>That great alpha auteur Paul Thomas Anderson returns with a crime drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio, with a musical score by Jonny Greenwood, and reportedly inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland about American conformism, authority and the war on drugs. <br>• 8 August</p>",

            "body" : "<p>I scattered my parents’ ashes in the backyard of my childhood home on New Year’s Eve 10 years ago, drunk on grief and prosecco, and buzzed on a borrowed joint and stale fruitcake.</p> <p>This wasn’t exactly how I’d planned to memorialize my parents. The evening had started innocently enough. A few hours earlier, I had been sipping tea and spooning my cat under a waning moon, with a new Ikea comforter and a fresh bag of Swedish fish. I had resigned myself to an evening devoid of social expectations and alcohol, of endlessly searching for the perfect plan and of the disappointment of never finding it.</p> <p>“This year will be different,” I told myself.</p> <p>I decided I’d watch other people celebrate as I counted down to midnight with bottomless cups of decaf Earl Grey, grilled cheese on rye and a wildly optimistic list of resolutions for my new Moleskine planner.</p> <p>My evening would be simple, quiet, contemplative and sober. No hangover. No waking up with a stranger. No regrets. No “Why does my mouth taste like cigarettes?” or “Why is my tongue orange?” (It’s Cheetos, Shanti, it’s always Cheetos.)</p> <p>I’d be fresh when others were foggy, quietly gloating as I jumpstarted the New Year with key action items from my “morning self-care” list: meditation, a sunrise swim and some sort of warm beverage involving turmeric. There would be planks, sit-ups, yoga or Pilates from my “just do it” exercise list, followed by vegan chickpea curry from my “healthy eating in the new year” list.</p> <p>And yes, I would absolutely work on the “where to scatter Mom &amp; Dad” list.</p> <p>It had been 12 years since losing my mom to a brain tumor, and four years since losing my dad on my 41st birthday. It wasn’t until after he died that I found my mom’s ashes at the foot of his bed, wrapped in her favorite light blue cotton sweater and nestled between a cold hot water bottle and a thick pair of wool socks. My dad had been sleeping with her ashes for eight years, a discovery that, to me, was both triumphant and heartbreaking.</p> <p>And no, I would absolutely not drink the bottle of prosecco burning a hole in my refrigerator door. Well, maybe just one glass. Or eat the stale fruitcake that my neighbor left for me on the porch three weeks ago.</p> <p>I had it all figured out. Until I didn’t.</p> <p>Three hours later and I’m wasted, wildly flinging fistfuls of my parents’ ashes into the air as I flail around the garden in my pyjamas with a joint in my mouth, an empty bottle of prosecco at my bare feet, and a Swedish fish stuck to my scalp.</p> <p>My cat is pensively watching from the window – too confused to be bothered.</p> <p>In an unfortunate twist, a strong gust of wind is propelling the ashes back at me, mixing with the heavy condensation in the air to create a thick paste that covers my body like some sort of exfoliating mud mask. Suddenly I’m shrouded in gritty powder.</p> <p>I’m blissfully unaware and it’s probably for the best. I’m shuffling around the gravel path and straining to sing over my “High School Daze Mega Mix” blasting from an old boombox on the balcony – mostly 80s tracks with a bit of 70s Blondie thrown in. I dug out the battered cassette tape from a dusty Vans shoebox in the attic after downing the second half of the Italian bubbly and gorging myself on what I believed to be the last Swedish fish (lest we forget the one atop my head).</p> <p>It is around this time that I remember that my roommate has a joint stashed in her sock drawer. I justify the heist because technically it was meant for me – a “medicinal offering” to induce some much-needed sleep after my dad died.</p> <p>Seeing as how I never took her up on her offer, I figure: “What better time to spark up that bad boy? It’s New Year’s Eve!”</p> <p>“Two puffs,” I whisper. “Two puffs and I’ll put it back. She’ll never know it was gone.”</p> <p>I’m not much of a drinker, and even less of a stoner. I’d be more likely to overdose on sugar or black tea, but somewhere between Pictures of You and Heart of Glass, I find myself floating on a cloud of sophomoric bliss. I’m euphoric.</p> <p>I’m circling the salvia (my dad’s favorite plant) as How Soon Is Now? shuffles into earshot when I’m suddenly consumed with what I believe to be, beyond a reasonable (or sober) doubt, the best-laid plan of my life.</p> <p>“It’s time to set my parents free. In their garden, here and now!”</p> <p>I throw my arms above my head, rejoicing in my decision, but sadly I’m preaching to an empty crowd. The neighbors have shut their windows and I’m pretty sure my cat has already fallen asleep.</p> <p>Believe me, this kind of impromptu, fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pyjama-pants plan wasn’t on any of my lists. Nor was it included in the plethora of grandiose memorial plans I had been tirelessly turning over in my grieving brain since losing both of my parents.</p> <p>And boy did I have plans: poetry and processions, festive lighting and a smorgasbord of friends, family and food. Faraway lands and distant shores. I’d scatter the ashes in India, Greece or Hawaii.</p> <p>I had thought about somewhere closer to home like the Sierras or the San Francisco Bay, but my dad had had a bad experience with a rattlesnake at 4,000ft and my mom thought the bay was too cold and foggy, so those were out.</p> <p>For all of these years, I had thought my plan had to be perfect. I thought it had to be as full of life and love and joy as my mother and father were.</p> <p>In the end, it was all those things, and we never left home. I’ve learned that life so rarely goes to plan.</p> <p>I woke up on New Year’s Day in the bathtub, nestled in a damp beach towel in what appeared to be the failed aftermath of hosing ashes off my body, judging by the paste-like mess stuck to me. I felt relatively good despite the circumstance. As I watched my cat sleeping peacefully on my toes, I felt a sense of relief I hadn’t experienced in a very long time.</p> <p>And all I could think was: “Why does my mouth taste like fruitcake?”</p> <ul> <li><p>Shanti L Nelson is a writer and photographer</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The policy changed a year ago and now requires <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/06/nationwide-rescinds-work-anywhere-policy-and-tells-staff-to-come-to-office\">staff to come in to the office at least two days a week</a>.</p> <p>Crosbie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday: “One of the only good things that came out of the pandemic was the fact that people got much more comfortable with working flexibly, working from home. And I do think that’s very useful.</p> <p>“My watch out, though, is that what we find, certainly at Nationwide, is that men are more likely to come into the office than women, and we just need to be really careful that we don’t prevent women from accessing the development-watching. I benefited enormously from watching some really excellent leaders and how they navigated challenging problems.”</p> <p>Crosbie, who took the helm at Nationwide in June 2022 after previously running TSB Bank, recalled working early in her career for Lynne Peacock, then chief executive of Clydesdale Bank, whom she described as a “very inspiring female CEO”.</p> <p>She considers herself lucky that she was already an executive when she had her daughter at the age of 32, “and it allowed me to get the opportunity to make different decisions. I got a great lot of support from business leaders who let me work part time for a few years.”</p> <p>Crosbie said women nowadays are having children later, often in their late 30s, which is the time when people usually advance to more senior executive positions.</p> <p>Last week, thousands of civil servants voted to strike after the Land Registry, which records the ownership of land and property across England and Wales, ordered them back to the office for three days a week.</p> <p>The move came after a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/09/in-no-great-rush-to-get-back-to-the-office-uk-home-workers-may-not-have-a-choice\">back-to-office mandates</a> from large corporates in recent months, including Amazon and Asda. There has also been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/29/more-staff-logging-on-from-uk-airports-and-rail-stations-iwg\">rise in working on the go</a>. Increasing numbers of professionals are using their daily commute or business trips to carry out some work, logging in from airports and railway stations across the UK, research suggests.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a> found that hybrid working was the standard pattern for more than a quarter (28%) of working adults in Great Britain in the autumn. One of the most frequently reported business reasons was “improved staff wellbeing”.</p>",

But thousands of Dutch families face having their relatives’ history laid bare later this week when an archive opens on 425,000 people accused of siding with the occupier during the second world war.</p> <p>On Thursday, the <a href=\"https://oorlogvoorderechter.nl/about-ovdr/\">central archives of the special jurisdiction courts</a> (CABR), established after the allies liberated the Netherlands to bring collaborators to justice, will open under national archive rules.</p> <p>Until now, the most visited war archive in the Netherlands has been accessible only to researchers, those involved and direct descendants. But from Thursday the physical archive will open to general visitors.</p> <p>For the first three months of 2025, researchers and descendants of victims and alleged perpetrators will also have digital access to a quarter of this extraordinary database – on site at the national archive in The Hague – for the first time.</p> <p>Relatives have mixed feelings about the move. “It’s a bit uncomfortable,” said Connie, 74, one of three sisters whose family history is contained in the archive. “I don’t know what could come out of it eventually, if people Google our surname.”</p> <p>But some in the Netherlands believe that openness about the country’s wartime past, including its economic and bureaucratic collaboration, is crucial. Three-quarters of the Dutch Jewish population – more than 102,000 people – were murdered by the Nazis, with <a href=\"https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/12/anti-semitism-in-the-netherlands-lessons-from-the-holocaust/\">antisemitic collaboration</a> from the state, police and some of the Dutch population.</p> <p>It is a past that the country is <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2024/03/the-dutch-are-facing-their-holocaust-demons/\">only now coming to terms with</a>, opening a national Holocaust museum, making a public apology and funding research into the role of institutions and transport firms.</p> <p>“This is part of the repression by the Dutch of their memories of collaboration, after we had punished our military and political collaborators,” said Johannes Houwink ten Cate, an emeritus professor of Holocaust studies at Amsterdam University. “I can understand the children and grandchildren of collaborators now fear possible consequences, but my personal experience is that their feelings come to rest once they have seen the files. Making this open is an important step.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/10/amsterdam-holocaust-museum-an-overdue-reckoning-with-history\">‘You cannot look away’: Amsterdam Holocaust museum opens amid protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Initially, the intention had been to put the archive online at the website Oorlog voor de Rechter (“war before the judges”) on Thursday. But the prospect sparked public disquiet and the Dutch <a href=\"https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/actueel/nationaal-archief-gewaarschuwd-om-online-openbaarmaking\">Data Protection Authority</a> (AP) issued a warning that putting the archive of suspected collaborators online would breach privacy laws.</p> <p>“In the spring of 2024, the AP had a signal from a surviving relative that the planned publication of the CABR was possibly not being organised in a lawful way,” it announced. “The national archives must now start working on an alternative method.”</p> <p>Online publication is delayed and the culture minister, Eppo Bruins, says the archive should not be indexable by search engines such as Google. But eventually it is hoped that 30m pages of witness reports, diaries, membership cards for the Dutch fascist party, medical records, court judgments, pardon pleas and pictures will all be searchable.</p> <p>At a recent event at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam, the director, Martijn Eickhoff, said the special court archive from 1944 and 1952 was a valuable historical resource. But it was also a period of wild accusation, he said: fewer than 15% of suspects were punished by tribunals and extraordinary courts, and two-thirds not at all.</p> <p>“It is important to look at this archive carefully,” he told the Guardian. “If a text is misleading, people become critical about the source, and this is what you learn to do as a historian … But because it contains so many personal documents, this affects people enormously.”</p> <p>He compared the Dutch archive with modern-day Syria, where global experts are working to preserve evidence of crimes under the toppled dictator Bashar al-Assad. “We hope to lead this experiment [opening the archive] on the right tracks. Not to open the door again to collective hatred,” he told a room of descendants, including Connie and her sisters Jolanda and Mieke.</p> <p>The sisters, who asked for their surname not to be published, have different feelings about the opening of the archive. While Connie is concerned, Jolanda, 70, said she did not mind and Mieke, 68, said she was keen to see her grandfather’s dossier. He had a building company that carried out work for the Nazis, and in the reckoning after the war he was punished for it. The sisters’ father worked there too.</p> <p>“But he was 18,” said Jolanda. “I don’t know what other things my grandfather believed, but Dad believed in a better world, not in Nazi ideology … But you can make choices, like my father’s family. Sometimes it’s a bad choice.”</p>",

A TikTok account shows Kambaza enjoying rides at the funfair or playing pranks on people.</p> \n<p>She was stabbed on Hinderwell Street in Hull on 26 January at about 3am and died shortly after being taken to hospital. Mateus Johannes, 28 and believed to be her boyfriend, was charged with her murder and the possession of a bladed article in a public space.</p> \n<p>Kambanza’s family has created a GoFundMe page to repatriate her body back to Namibia, where she was originally from. “Her sudden death has torn her parents’ heart apart,” it says.</p> \n<h2>Tara Kershaw<br><em>Died 20 January, aged 33</em></h2> \n<p>Tara Kershaw was loved by many: her two young daughters, her siblings and their children, her parents and many members of her wider community.</p> \n<p>Her family described her as a “loving and kind soul”, someone who “had a face that was well known all over”. That’s why they “struggl[ed] to come to terms” with the fact that she could die in her own home in Great Yarmouth, aged 33, of injuries consistent with compression to the neck, by someone that police thought she had known.</p> \n<p>A man who lived at the same address, Adam Barnard, 40, has been charged with her murder. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has announced it is investigating Norfolk police’s “conduct, action and decision making” after it emerged the force had previous contact with Kershaw.<strong> </strong></p> \n<h2>Kanticha Sukpengpanao<br><em>Died 19 January, aged 36</em></h2> \n<p>Kanticha Sukpengpanao’s love for her nieces was such that she had travelled from her home in Thailand to Norfolk to visit them. It was while on this trip that she would be found dead alongside the children she had come to see.</p> \n<p>The discovery of her body, alongside those of 12-year-old Jasmin Kuczynska and eight-year-old Natasha Kuczynska, and her brother-in-law, Bartlomiej Kuczynski, shocked those living in the town of Costessey, near Norwich.</p> \n<p>Sukpengpanao has been described as a supportive friend and a loving aunt who will be missed by many. A friend told the Mirror: “Kanticha was very nice and caring to all friends of her … she helped everyone.”</p> \n<p>Sukpengpanao and the children died of stab wounds. Kuczynski died of a single stab wound in his neck. Norfolk police have confirmed they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths. The force has referred itself to the police watchdog over reports Kuczynski made a 999 call from the property to which officers were not dispatched.</p> \n<h2>Alison McLaughlin<br><em>Died 5 January, aged 53</em></h2> \n<p>For Alison McLaughlin, 2024 had got off to a happy start. The 53-year-old had become a grandparent to baby Alilynne. But three weeks later, she was found dead in her home in Greenock, Inverclyde, on 5 January.</p> \n<p>McLaughin was found lying next to her dead husband, Neil McLaughlin, 57, after neighbours sounded the alarm.</p> \n<p>Described by friends as a “lovely couple, always happy”, the picture circulating in news reports shows a well-groomed pair. Police are treating her death as murder and Neil McLaughlin’s as suicide.</p> \n<p>DI Gordon Smith, of Police Scotland, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of both Alison and Neil. They have asked for privacy at what is a very difficult time for them.”</p> \n<h2>Maya Bracken <br><em>Died 4 January, aged 56</em></h2> \n<p>“Lovely” was the word that kept cropping up when people spoke about Mayawati – or Maya – Bracken, 56. A friend described her as “an amazing, quirky, hilarious woman who made everyone smile who met her. RIP to a beautiful lady.” Another added that she was “such a lovely lady”.</p> \n<p>On 4 January, police were called to reports of an incident and found Bracken stabbed in the chest in a Lexus on the A340 Tidmarsh Road in Berkshire.</p> \n<p>About an hour later there were reports of a second death. Julian Bracken, 18, believed to be her son, was found dead on the tracks near Pangbourne station. Thames Valley police said no further suspects were being sought.</p> \n<h2>Tia Simmonds <br><em>Died 3 January, aged 32</em></h2> \n<p>Tia Simmonds’ body was found in the storage area of a converted loft in her home, lying face down covered in items of clothing and bedding, according to the prosecutor working on her case.</p> \n<p>The 32-year-old was discovered at the home she shared with her husband, Shane Simmonds, in Lewisham, south-east London, on 3 January. </p> \n<p>Simmonds, 38, was charged with his wife’s murder the following day. He was also charged with two counts of rape in relation to a teenage girl and has since been remanded in custody, with a trial date set for 14 October.</p> \n<h2>Keotshepile Naso Isaacs<br><em>Died 1 January, aged 33</em></h2> \n<p>Keotshepile Naso Isaacs, known as Naso, arrived in the UK a year ago from Otse, a village in south-east Botswana, with the dream of building a new life for her and her three sons.</p> \n<p>On New Year’s Day, those dreams were destroyed when she was found dead, aged 33, at a property in the Scottish seaside town of North Berwick. Her husband, Mompati Dodo Isaacs, 37, was charged with her murder.</p> \n<p>Neighbours, who had made a “report of concern” to the police, described Naso as “a loving mum to her boys, who must be absolutely devastated”. Friends on social media paid tribute to a “beautiful soul”.</p> \n<p><em>In the UK, call the national <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">domestic abuse helpline</a> on 0808 2000 247, or visit the <a href=\"https://www.killedwomen.org/useful-links\">Killed Women</a> website for details of other support agencies.

            "body" : "<p>This year,<strong> </strong>18 of Africa’s 54 countries went to the polls for presidential or general elections, making 2024 a significant year on the continent. There were high hopes for renewed commitment to fair governance, transparency and equal representation. In particular there were hopes for women’s political participation, for more women to be elected to office to shape policies that address the needs of all citizens.</p> <p>For more than a decade, we at the human rights organisation <a href=\"https://www.mewc.org/index.php\">Make Every Woman Count (MEWC)</a> have been tracking women’s political participation across Africa. Unfortunately, we did not see the progress we hoped for this year. In 2014, there were three women serving as heads of state across Africa. In 2024, there were two: the president of Tanzania, Samia Suluhu Hassan, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/namibia-elects-its-first-female-president-in-disputed-elections\">Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who became Namibia’s first female president-elect</a> on 3 December; the result is being <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/court-rules-namibia-opposition-parties-can-inspect-election-data-2024-12-13/\">contested in court</a>. Nandi-Ndaitwah was the sole woman among 15 candidates, underscoring the persistent gender disparity in contests for high office.</p> <p>Ghana also made history by electing Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang as its <a href=\"https://www.africanews.com/2024/12/09/ghana-makes-history-with-first-female-vice-president-elect-prof-naana-jane-opoku-agyemang/\">first female vice-president</a>.</p>    <p>Statistics on female representation in parliament offer slightly more optimism.<strong> </strong>The proportion of female MPs in Africa has risen marginally, from <a href=\"https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/womens-political-participation-africa-barometer-2024\">25% in 2021 to 26%</a>, data up to July 2024 shows. Quotas to enhance women’s representation have yielded notable successes in countries such as Rwanda, South Africa, Senegal and Tanzania, but this single percentage-point increase reveals there is still a long way to go in achieving equal political participation.</p> <p>Breaking down the barriers for women requires more than just policy reforms. It calls for a cultural shift in societal attitudes, stronger enforcement of gender-equality measures, and relentless advocacy to ensure women can fully participate in the political arena.<strong><br>• </strong><em><strong>Rai Sow, executive director, Make Every Woman Count</strong></em></p> <p><strong>We asked three female politicians – from Senegal, Mozambique and South Africa – about their fight to get to parliament in 2024 and the change they hope to bring:</strong></p> <h2>‘An old man said it would be too difficult for him to support a candidate who wears gold earrings’</h2> <p><strong>Thérèse Faye Diouf</strong><strong>, 43, </strong><strong>Senegal</strong></p> <p>In November, I was elected for the first time as one of the 73 women in our 165-member parliament – the highest percentage in west Africa. This is a small sign of progress: <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/africa/2024-04-16-new-senegal-president-new-cabinet-same-limits-on-women/\">only four women </a>were in the 34-person executive cabinet appointed in April.</p> <p>My six children know me as their mother but my constituents in Diarrère in Fatick region in south-west Senegal know me as the mother of the Diarhère community. I was their mayor from 2014 to 2022, the first woman elected to the position.</p>    <p>I am also a former minister of women’s affairs, community development and social equality under the previous government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/02/bassirou-diomaye-faye-to-be-sworn-in-as-senegal-youngest-president\">President Macky Sall.</a></p> <p>After studying sociology at university, I worked as a legislative aide and then headed an agency for early childhood care.</p> <p>My father, a gendarme, was initially hesitant to allow me to participate in politics – and I faced other challenges. Multitasking helped: I combined work with academia and politics, defending my master’s thesis a few weeks after giving birth. In March 2011, the government accused me of being part of a thwarted coup d’état but I was cleared. My daughter was only six months old at the time.</p> <p>Another memory sticks out for me, from my run for mayor. At a meeting I had with the community, there was an old man who said it would be too difficult for him to support a candidate who wears gold earrings. It was his way of saying he did not want a woman mayor. After my election, he came back to say he regretted his words and realised women are more effective than men in terms of governance.</p> <p>As minister for women’s affairs, I pushed a bill for social protection but, after we left office, no one touched it. As a member of parliament with the Alliance for the Republic (APR) party, this can be an opportunity for me to put it back on the table. I will also push for access to land for women. These things must be a concern for the government.</p> <p>We must focus on basic education and getting young people to adopt the cult of intelligentsia, to opt for the best. <br>• <em>As told to Eromo Egbejule</em></p> <h2>‘My message to women and girls is if they want change, they must fight for it’</h2> <p><strong>Rute Manjate, 56, </strong><strong>Mozambique</strong></p> <p>In October, I stood for the second time as a Podemos parliamentary candidate for Maputo city. </p> <p>We didn’t win any seats in the 2019 elections, but now we are the biggest opposition party.<strong> </strong>We in Podemos are disillusioned with the ruling party Frelimo. Our country is in such a state because of it. There is a class there that sees itself as the masters – in Frelimo, governance is only for the benefit of this class and not for the country.</p> <p>We have natural resources, but the people aren’t benefiting at all. For example, we have a lot of wood, but there are children who sit on the floor at school for lack of desks. We have a lot of gas, but many Mozambicans still can’t cook with gas. We have the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric plant, but energy is very expensive.</p> <p>My biggest dream is that the largest percentage of our extracted resources should go to the Mozambican people. My ambition is to be president of a parliament that is balanced politically, with all parties able to discuss and pass laws by consensus, for the benefit of the people.</p>    <p>Mozambique women hold <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45483.pdf\">43% of parliamentary seats</a>. I hope this continues, because we have something to say in the political arena.</p> <p>Thank God, in Podemos I don’t suffer any discrimination. There are equal opportunities and rights, so I have never felt disadvantaged because I’m a woman.</p> <p>My message to women and girls is that if they want change in this country, they must fight for it and to fight is to be involved politically.</p> <p>I had a very bitter experience during this year’s elections which shows how difficult politics can be in Mozambique, when elections are <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/10/24/mozambiques-ruling-party-wins-elections-amid-nationwide-protests\">marked by </a>irregularities. This year, I witnessed vote swapping in one of the polling stations in Maputo where I went to monitor the counting process.</p> <p> We asked the police to open a case, but they refused.</p> <p>A few days after the election, a local Frelimo representative said that opposition people shouldn’t be allowed to exist. He was asking for my number.<strong> </strong>I feel scared but I can’t run away, because that’s my home and I don’t have anywhere to hide. </p> <p>I spoke about it to [Podemos lawyer] Dr Elvino Dias. Just days later, on 18 October, Dr Elvino was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/mozambique-opposition-figures-killed-protest-disputed-election-podemos\">shot dead</a> [alongside Podemos representative Paulo Guambe].</p> <p>I haven’t got over his death. We were very close. He would look at me and say: “You know, Rute, I see a judge in you. So I encourage you to study law.”</p> <p>I didn’t manage to get into university, but he helped me a lot with books and exam preparation. I hope that one day, in his honour, I can continue with the dream he had of seeing me become a judge.<br>• <em>As told to Rachel Savage and Samuel Come</em></p> <h2>‘Being queer does not take away that we are fighting the same struggle’</h2> <p><strong>Steve Letsike, 38, South Africa</strong></p> <p>As a teen, I was a member of the youth league of the African National Congress (South Africa’s largest political party), but I did not remain active as an adult because the work I was doing as an activist in the social justice movement was really to hold the state accountable.</p> <p>I worked in LGBTQ+ organisations. We campaigned for laws around adoption and civil unions. I worked in public health, reaching out to gay men and looking at how they can get access to treatment for HIV.</p> <p>I saw political neglect, particularly around gender issues, around women’s issues, LGBTQ+ [and] vulnerable groups’ issues. Are we allowing the struggle that has been fought for by the ANC and others, the freedom that has been fought for, to be squandered?</p> <p>About six of us who were LGBTQ+ ANC members organised the Embrace Diversity Movement to campaign on LGBTQ+ issues within the party and society, looking at policy and political education. When we established it in 2018, we started identifying queer people who could then run for political office.</p> <p>When I ran for the national executive committee (NEC) in 2022, we knew that we needed a strong campaign. I was unsuccessful that year.</p>    <p>But the ANC leadership was ready to turn over a leaf and strengthen its activism. In January 2023, I was among four people brought into the NEC to ensure the leadership was representative of South African society. [In May 2024, Letsike was elected to parliament representing the ANC and in July appointed deputy minister for women, children, and people with disabilities.]</p> <p>I experienced homophobia and trolling while campaigning in 2022, in the general elections and even as a deputy minister. It was not easy, because immediately identity politics were at play. I use the name Steve, because I got it when I was a soccer player. So a lot of people are confused, asking: “Steve, is he a man?” I don’t identify as a man, I never have. I would get a lot of misgendering and I have to always correct that.</p> <p>There were online bullying comments that said: “Oh, the ANC is turning gay, the ANC is losing its focus.” But being queer does not take away that we are fighting the same struggle.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/06/elections-vote-women-gender-equality-leadership-harassment\">Half of the world goes to the polls in 2024.

If it’s wrong, it’s wrong and it must be called out.</p> <p>In a ministry, you don’t get to remove yourself from society. You become that activist government. When there are struggles, I still call whoever needs help. Just simple things like that, because those are meaningful things.</p> <p>My ambition is that South Africans must be able to prosper, must be able to see themselves being part of change.<br>• <em>As told to Rachel Savage</em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>In the penultimate episode of season two of The Traitors UK, Harry – a baby-faced army engineer – is given the choice between adding £7,000 to the collective prize pot, or taking it for himself.</p> <p>He decides to share, saying that he’s been “a team player since the start” – and adding that “obviously, it’s more money to split” for their eventual triumph. What the audience knows, and most of Harry’s fellow players don’t, is that he is a Traitor, working against them – and only turning down the £7,000 because he feels confident in walking away with the entire £100,000.</p> <p>Lisa Oakley, a psychologist and professor at Chester University, plays the clip of Harry’s stirring speech in her social psychology lectures, as a masterclass in manipulation. “What he’s actually building there is an image of himself as a Faithful, and it’s just beautiful,” she says. “Then, when you play it to the students and say, ‘Actually, he was a Traitor’… The language that people use, the way that they talk about themselves, is really important.”</p> <p>The crash-course in human psychology presented by The Traitors UK is perhaps one reason for its success. The cloak-and-daggers gameshow was a surprise hit when it first aired back in November 2022, and went on to draw record audiences for its second season last January.</p>    <p>Notably, The Traitors caught on with people who didn’t ordinarily watch reality TV – perhaps because it actually reflects reality. Most of us have never competitively eaten entrails, or sung for our supper in front of Simon Cowell. Nearly everyone, however, has experience of having to get along with a group, win over a difficult room or tell a white lie to a friend.</p> <p>“I’d hardly watched reality TV at all – I don’t know anything about the Love Islands and all that – but The Traitors did capture people who don’t generally have an interest,” says Ian Parsley, a public relations consultant (and former Northern Irish politician) <a href=\"https://ianjamesparsley.wordpress.com/2023/02/05/the-traitors-was-compelling-because-it-was-real-life/\">who wrote about</a> the series last year.</p> <p>For Parsley, the many parallels between The Traitors gameplay and real-world group dynamics were key to the fascination – and a “superb demonstration of exactly what is right, and wrong, with human civilisation”. The heated but circular roundtable discussions, for example – where the players seek to identify and banish the Traitors among them – underscored “why meetings and committees fundamentally do not work” to reach effective decisions, Parsley says. Between the herd mentality and flawed logic on display, “they might as well have tossed a coin”, he adds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The natural impulse to align with kindred spirits risks leading you astray, distorting your perception of other players</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/how-to-win-the-traitors-chance-not-tactics-7cqxfj9rw\">One analysis did in fact find</a> that the contestants’ decisions were “statistically indistinguishable from chance”, suggesting Faithfuls really would do just as well to target players at random as endure the roundtable deliberations.</p> <p>It is proof of both the fiendish difficulty of the game and the psychological blindspots it exploits. For Oakley, The Traitors was such a sufficiently rich text that – together with Clea Wright and Kevin Hochard, her fellow psychologists at Chester University – <a href=\"https://www.chester.ac.uk/about/news/articles/podcast-explores-the-psychology-of-the-traitors/\">she was inspired to</a> start a podcast, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/4mlX6OZRgRodLBmkNZrfuj?si=2b93ce033c2a4bb9\">Psychology of The Traitors</a>.</p> <p>One of the key influences they identified on the gameplay was the presence of “in-groups” and “out-groups”. “We tend to favour people who are like us – or who we think are like us,” says Oakley. In the Traitors US, featuring celebrity contestants, players formed explicit alliances on the basis of their past shows or networks: the Survivor alumni, the Bravo Housewives.</p> <p>On The Traitors, however, the natural impulse to align with kindred spirits risks leading you astray, distorting your perception of other players. For example, Faithfuls often defend their friends or allies by saying they “could never be a Traitor”, even though the Traitors don’t self-select.</p> <p>“Players never really seem to get their head around the fact that trustworthiness, and whether or not somebody’s a Traitor, are completely unrelated,” says Wright, who studies lying and deceptive behaviour. “If they decide they trust someone, they decide that person can’t be a Traitor – logic deserts people.”</p> <p>The task is made more difficult by the challenges – which build a genuine team spirit between Faithfuls and Traitors – and the isolated yet immersive environment. Contestants struggle “to see it as a game”, says Wright, recalling their podcast interview with Ivan Brett, a Faithful on season one. “He was shocked at how important it was for him to feel liked, to be part of that in-group and not be ostracised.”</p> <p>Similarly, in season two, another Faithful had an on-screen meltdown after being called a “sheep” (he later ended up <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/tv/traitors-brian-tattoo-bbc-sheep\">getting a sheep tattoo,</a> to show just how unbothered he was).</p> <p>It demonstrates the power of social identity, and our need to belong, to cloud our judgment and derail decision-making. In season two, Jaz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/aug/09/i-just-cried-in-the-car-the-traitors-star-who-was-sent-hundreds-of-shocking-tales-of-betrayal\">was dubbed “Jazatha Christie” by viewers</a> for catching on to Harry’s treacherous game, but failed to rally his fellow Faithfuls in time to stop him.</p>    <p>“He assessed the situation entirely correctly, he didn’t allow his emotions to overrule, he was deductive – he really played a very good game,” says Hochard, head of psychology at University of Chester. “[But] he hadn’t fostered those links early enough, so he couldn’t effect the change.”</p> <p>The psychologists found that many of the roundtable votes were decided by just one influential voice, causing a “domino effect” of consensus, regardless of the validity of the argument.</p> <p>Late in season two, for example, the contestants concluded that a remaining Traitor is likely male – then all wound up voting for a woman. “There’s often these gaping holes … They mistake a feeling, or an idea that they have about somebody as evidence,” says Wright.</p> <p>It’s not stupidity, she adds, but a reflection of the “incredibly difficult task” faced by the Faithfuls. While Traitors might struggle with the cognitive burden of having to lie (Wilfred, in season one, seemed to age years under the strain), they benefit from oversight and agency. The Faithfuls, on the other hand, “are essentially punching in a dark room, because they don’t have any information,” says Wright.</p> <p>It’s true that, across the many international formats of the game, Faithfuls have typically struggled. New Zealand’s first season was an exception, with three Traitors voted off in the first three episodes – a far better result than could be achieved by chance.</p>    <p>Dylan Reeve, who was eventually murdered by the Traitors, suggests that they might have been “more focused” than other Faithful groups. “We were taking the game seriously, not getting caught up in our own drama … No one told us to play that way, and we never discussed it – it was just how we all approached it.”</p> <p>Though some of the contestants had pre-existing relationships (it being New Zealand, population 5 million), Reeve believes that had little effect over the outcome. “Even when you know someone well, you don’t usually practise detecting their lies … If I had to pick one thing that set us apart, I think it was probably communication: we were all communicating well and openly, and we paid close attention to the mechanics of the game around us.”</p> <p>In the absence of evidence or leadership, subconscious biases can easily take over at the round table. Writing about the UK season two, Ranuli Jayawardhana <a href=\"https://www.shoutoutuk.org/2024/04/23/microagressions-reality-tv-is-the-playground-responsible-for-teaching-racist-behaviour/\">observed</a> that the contestants deemed “suspicious” by the group were often people of colour. “Obviously, the game is so emotionally charged – it brings up a lot of tension, and I think that sometimes manifests itself as microaggressions,” she says.</p>    <p>Jayawardhana points to Jaz’s failure to influence the group, relative to the Traitors Harry and Paul, both white. “It was incredibly revealing to see exactly who people trusted – whether it was on the basis of race, or that this person was more, quote-unquote, ‘normal’.”</p> <p>Sometimes these judgments are overt. Host Claudia Winkleman <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/claudia-winkleman-problematic-traitors-murdering-women-154829559.html\">herself has called the</a> pattern of targeting of older women “problematic”. In season one, a woman was voted out for not cheersing along with the group, even after she pointed out that she was prevented from doing so by her limb difference. On The Traitors US, the first player to be eliminated was Peppermint, a trans woman and RuPaul’s Drag Race alum; <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/pepperment-the-traitors-reunion-elimination-watch\">she later said</a> the other players had targeted her for being “the most different”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the absence of evidence or leadership, subconscious biases can easily take over at the round table</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To Jayawardhana, it’s proof of how greater diversity and representation on reality TV has not yet translated to all contestants being free to fully participate. “The herd mentality is more directed at ethnic minorities” than inclusive of them, she points out. “There’s still that undercurrent of ‘It’s us versus them.’”</p> <p>But watching those dynamics play out on The Traitors may help to bring them to light, Jayawardhana suggests. “If you can see it on a screen, then you know it happens in person … I think it’s worth having these conversations, because it’s often unconscious.”</p> <p>Indeed, those apparently off-the-cuff exchanges and unexpected eruptions are part of what makes the show so compelling and insightful. Like all reality TV, The Traitors is edited and manipulated to create characters and a storyline. But relative to other shows, the format seems thus far resistant to advance strategising: players can’t help but be exposed.</p> <p>Wright agrees. It’s tempting to imagine from our sofas that we’d win hearts and minds as a Faithful, or escape detection as a Traitor, but, she says, “a lot of these psychological mechanisms that we talk about will apply unconsciously – whether we want them to or not”.</p> <p>• The Traitors returns for its third series on BBC One on New Year’s Day</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Neil Duncan-Jordan’s new parliamentary office is at the top of a steep staircase in a maze of corridors just behind the speaker’s house, with a sweeping view of the Thames. The space is decorated with mod posters and jazz vinyls; he has Miles Davis playing on the record player.</p> <p>“I want it to be me,” he said, gesturing around the room. “Because this place isn’t me, is it? Working-class people didn’t come here very often in the past. Now there’s many more of us and we bring our traditions. Somehow you’ve got to try and make this part of you.”</p> <p>Duncan-Jordan, the first Labour MP for Poole, had never expected to be sitting here. But he has made a big impression, speaking out against government decisions on winter fuel payments and the refusal of compensation for Waspi women.</p> <p>He is one of Labour’s 33 so-called “bonus MPs” who arrived in Westminster from non-target seats. Some have their own WhatsApp group to navigate the surprise of leaving behind jobs and families to sit in the House of Commons.</p> <p>Sam Carling, the Labour MP for North West Cambridgeshire, was studying for a master’s when he got elected aged 22. “During the campaign you just have tunnel vision. And when you win, you have to move house and start a new job, essentially start a small business recruiting staff,” he said.</p> <p>The new MPs are from different wings of the party. Duncan-Jordan joked that they were all acutely aware they may not get long in the job. “My neighbour [another MP] said people like you are dangerous because you’re not after a career. You weren’t supposed to be here, and you’ve got nothing to lose.”</p> <p>Weeks into the job, he created an early day motion opposing the government’s decision to cut the winter fuel payment. “I didn’t speak out against the government on a winter fuel payment because I was trying to be difficult or nasty,” he said. “I’ve had 30 years of campaigning on means testing and in support of universalism. I just think it’s wrong. I was prepared to say something. I haven’t been elected just to do what everybody else tells me to do.”</p> <p>Arriving in Westminster by accident does not always mean MPs will be rebellious. Carling said he was personally more sanguine about the government having to do unpopular things early on. “We’ve got a lot of mess to fix. We may not be popular initially,” he said.</p>    <p>Terry Jermy, who unseated Liz Truss in South West Norfolk, is among those whom Labour HQ is surprised, but delighted, to see in Westminster.</p> <p>“I put zero time into thinking about what would happen when I got here. And it took me a few months to feel comfortable in the role,” he said. But he thinks having MPs from backgrounds like his – rural poverty, farming – should give No 10 a much broader perspective on the policies it is enacting.</p> <p>“I am the Labour MP with the most number of [constituents] using heating oil. People used the winter fuel allowance to pay for that,” he said. “All my family work in farming and agriculture. I find myself talking about farming and I’m like: oh, OK, you know, there’s something I can offer here.”</p> <p>Changes to inheritance tax had been difficult in his constituency, he said. “I think [local farmers] were expecting somebody to rock up who doesn’t know anything about farming, and they’ve all gone away like: OK, we had some wrong preconceived ideas about a Labour MP – and they’ve found that quite reassuring.”</p> <p>Labour’s election campaign had a reputation for being ruthless, especially around some controversial selections, and target seats had dedicated organisers, polling and a nationwide demand for activists. But in non-target seats it was a scratch campaign with a hardcore of local members.</p> <p>The party nationally would demand that many candidates in non-target seats were “twinned” with winnable seats and spend time campaigning there, bringing their activists there instead. In extreme cases, the party turned off the canvassing data for seats deemed non-winnable. Some won anyway.</p> <p>But many of the “bonus MPs” told the Guardian they had fun with their relative freedom, constructing their own ad vans or doing crowdfunding campaigns.</p>    <p>“We had to gear up very quickly somewhere that’s never been Labour before,” said Laura Kyrke-Smith, the MP for Aylesbury. “I think it’s fair to say there were some in the party that didn’t think we could win. But actually it meant there were a lot of people locally that were very invested in winning. And I think it does add a nice energy to it when you’ve got a lot of people stepping up for themselves.”</p> <p>Duncan-Jordan reckons he started out with “about a dozen” local activists. He overturned a 19,000-strong majority to win by 18 votes. “I’ll be absolutely honest, we might not be able to do that again,” he said. “Everything aligns. The moment is just absolutely right. The candidate’s right. The mood of the country’s right. The timing’s right.”</p> <p>Jermy ran a crowdfunding campaign for leaflets – “it’s Terry or Truss” – to drum support to unseat the former prime minister. “People were so angry,” he said.</p>    <p>The inexperience on his campaign team meant Jermy was never quite sure if his team was running the data correctly when they saw Tory villages coming out for Labour. But they weren’t wrong. “I got there at 2am and I knew I’d won, because it was so clear.”</p> <p>Carling also had to run his own data for the campaign, sitting at a laptop at his election count assessing the numbers.</p> <p>Prof Phil Cowley, of Queen Mary University of London, said the last slew of “bonus MPs” came in 1997. Some were slightly more rebellious – about 34% rebelled in the first term, he said. But many were not one-term wonders in the end. “I might be pointing out as a whip that lots of those unexpected MPs in 1997 hung on in 2001,” he said.</p> <p>Others who spoke to the Guardian have their own issues they hope to campaign on – some of which have been uncomfortable for the government. </p> <p>Kyrke-Smith hopes to have a voice on the government’s planning reforms, and to sound a note of caution from Aylesbury’s experience. “There’s been 13,000 houses built under the previous Tory government without enough facilities or services or infrastructure – that came up again and again,” she said.</p> <p>“I think there’s a lot to learn from places like Aylesbury. They totally get that we need more houses, but they really need it to be done in the right way so that it’s matched by infrastructure and services.”</p> <p>She also hopes to do her own work on postnatal mental health, perhaps even amending legislation, after the suicide of a friend who had just had a baby. </p> <p>All said they felt the only way they could hold on to their seats after the next election was to deliver tangible change locally. “I think I want to do as much as we can as quickly as we can,” Kyrke-Smith said.</p> <p>Duncan-Jordan said: “I’m absolutely convinced that the way to win the seat again is to be a good local constituency MP. So sorting people’s problems out on the ground, being visible, being accessible. Nothing pompous, just a regular bloke. And that connects with people.”</p>",

            "body" : "<h2><strong>Front row</strong></h2> <p>The Lions are stronger in certain areas than others and much hinges, in every sense, on Ireland’s front row. No one would quibble hugely if an all-Irish triumvirate of <strong>Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan </strong>and <strong>Tadhg Furlong</strong> pack down for the first Test against the Wallabies in Brisbane on 19 July – but what if all three are not fully firing? The talented, athletic Sheehan is just back from a long-term layoff and injury forced Porter to withdraw from the last Lions tour to South Africa before the squad’s departure. The admirable Furlong, meanwhile, has already been hammering away on Test rugby’s frontline for a decade. It underlines the importance of strength in depth, with the Australia scrum much improved. Both Scotland props, Pierre Schoeman and Zander Fagerson, will fancy making the plane, as will the Wales hooker Dewi Lake (current injury permitting) and, depending on England’s Six Nations form, either Jamie George or Theo Dan. Ellis Genge and Nicky Smith are probably contesting the last loosehead vacancy, with Ireland’s Finlay Bealham, born in Australia, as the&nbsp;third tighthead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/24/the-breakdown-awards-best-quotes-rugby-union\">The Breakdown awards: best rugby matches, players and quotes of 2024</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Second row</strong></h2> <p>The 2025 squad will not be stuffed full of returning Lions. It may even be that Furlong and Maro Itoje are the only starting forwards from 2021 to retain their Test places, making the latter’s experience even more important. Again the Six Nations will be instructive but, at this distance, Ireland’s Joe McCarthy and James Ryan are the two main frontrunners to partner Itoje. A decent lineout presence will be essential, with the ex-England lock Geoff Parling now shaping Australia’s strategy in that area, and McCarthy’s impact could be key. The other option involves moving the excellent Tadhg Beirne up from the back row, where Andy Farrell will be keen to start him, or opting for Wales’s hard‑working Dafydd Jenkins. Either way, another mobile and versatile lineout forward will be required, with Ireland’s talented Ryan Baird looking to edge out Ollie Chessum and the evergreen Courtney Lawes.</p> <h2><strong>Back row</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps the trickiest selection conundrum of the lot. <strong>Caelan Doris,</strong> Ireland’s captain, would make an excellent Lions skipper and the consistent<strong> Josh van der Flier</strong> is another shoo-in. Add <strong>Tadhg</strong> <strong>Beirne</strong> and that potentially leaves just four more squad vacancies. Only three from Jac Morgan, Ben Earl, Jack Willis, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Rory Darge look certain to make it, with Willis’s form for Toulouse so good he will be difficult to ignore. There is just one snag: if Toulouse make the Top 14 final on 28 June the Englishman will in effect be unavailable for the first three games of the tour. That, in turn, could mean him starting the first Test on the bench, with Morgan and Earl taking the early-tour strain. The final slot will be earmarked for a hard-carrying, dynamic No 8, with Aaron Wainwright, Jack Conan, Jack Dempsey, Chandler Cunningham‑South, Taulupe Faletau, Taine Plumtree and Tom Willis all candidates. Wainwright would boost Wales’s representation, while the ex-Wallaby Dempsey could bring useful inside knowledge.</p> <h2><strong>Half-backs</strong></h2> <p>No Lions tour succeeds without a smart, influential pair of half-backs. <strong>Jamison Gibson-Park</strong> has been at the heart of Ireland’s finest displays and England’s Alex Mitchell and Wales’s Tomos Williams are next in line, ahead of Ben White, George Horne and Ben Spencer. Fly-half? Think back to the last Test the Lions played in Australia, in Sydney in 2013, and Johnny Sexton’s influence when the chips were down. Whether or not <strong>Finn Russell</strong> is Andy Farrell’s idea of a perfect 10, both he and Marcus Smith add spark to any side. Either way&nbsp;– and allowing for Smith’s occasional redeployment at full-back – a third 10 with another positional string to his bow will be needed. Is that Owen Farrell, not currently playing Test rugby? Or might Scotland’s Tom Jordan, who can also play 15, be the answer? Ireland’s Sam Prendergast and Ciarán Frawley will hope otherwise.</p> <h2><strong>Midfield</strong></h2> <p>If a team’s strength is best gauged by the names omitted, the 2025 Lions will be impressively strong. Robbie Henshaw, Ollie Lawrence, Henry Slade and Cam Redpath are all seriously talented but limited preparation time and shorter tours make it harder to forge dream partnerships – Brian O’Driscoll and Jamie Roberts, for example, in South Africa in 2009. Step forward “Huw-ipolotu” – the Glasgow and Scotland pairing of <strong>Sione Tuipolotu </strong>and <strong>Huw Jones</strong> and the steely Irish combo of Bundee Aki and Garry Ringrose. With Russell at 10, the Scotland duo would be accustomed to their conductor’s rhythm. And if things need tightening up and pressure needs applying to the Wallabies’ playmakers then Aki and Ringrose are perfectly suited. If Owen Farrell is missing, though, someone else needs to be versatile enough to fill in at centre. Ireland’s Jamie Osborne is already a player whom Andy Farrell admires.</p> <h2><strong>Back three</strong></h2> <p><strong>Blair Kinghorn</strong>’s form for Toulouse makes him favourite to start at full-back. As with the aforementioned Willis, though, Kinghorn will struggle to feature in the first three games if his club make the Top 14 final.

On the wings <strong>Manny Feyi-Waboso</strong>, <strong>Duhan van der Merwe </strong>and James Lowe, if fit, all have the pedigree and strike rate to merit squad selection but the Wallabies’ aerial prowess may count against the brilliant but diminutive Darcy Graham.

            "body" : "<p>Keir Starmer will face a key test of his claims to leadership on the climate early next year, when the UK’s statutory advisers issue their latest advice on future cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>The independent Climate Change Committee will set out recommendations on the UK’s seventh carbon budget on 26 February. At the core of the budget will be an overall cap on emissions for the years 2038 to 2042, needed to meet the legal obligation of reaching net zero emissions in 2050.</p> <p>While the scope of this budget will fall long outside the current parliament, policies to achieve the recommended cuts will be needed much sooner. By 2035, the UK should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/26/campaigners-call-for-steeper-cuts-to-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">already have slashed emissions</a>, relative to 1990 levels, by about 81%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/keir-starmer-to-unveil-ambitious-new-uk-climate-goal-cop29-ndc\">international pledge unveiled by Starmer</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/26/how-late-deal-left-a-sense-of-dissatisfaction-and-betrayal-at-cop29-baku\">Cop29 UN climate summit in November</a>.</p> <p>The seventh carbon budget will need to go beyond that: by 2040, emissions should be about a quarter of what they are today.</p> <p>Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the E3G thinktank, said: “The seventh carbon budget should not be met with fear. It is the opportunity to put the finishing touches to a project to rewire the UK economy, to make it globally competitive and help nature to flourish. The only question is whether our leaders have the courage to be ambitious and stand up to the vested interests standing in our way.”</p>    <p>That will require not just the decarbonisation of the power sector, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/16/buses-trains-bicycle-paths-labour-mission-decarbonise-transport\">Labour has made one of its flagship “missions</a>”, but also drastic changes in many other sectors of the economy. Fossil-fuelled cars must be switched for electric vehicles, and a widescale revival of public transport will be needed; homes must be insulated, and gas boilers exchanged for heat pumps; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/28/uk-failing-to-honour-net-zero-farming-pledges-report-finds\">big changes will be needed to farming practices</a>; new techniques for industry; and tree-planting and nature programmes will be needed to restore the UK’s carbon sinks.</p> <p>For Ed Miliband, secretary of state for energy security and net zero, setting a new carbon budget has a personal resonance. When Labour was last in power, he took on the role of the secretary of state at the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change in October 2008. A month later parliament passed the Climate Change Act, under which the five-year carbon budgets are set.</p> <p>Requiring governments to set limits on emissions far in advance of their own term was intended to create long-term certainty, helping national and local government to plan, and giving businesses the signals and clear direction of travel they need to invest in the shift to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>The CCC cannot require the government to legislate for particular policies, but gives guidance on where emissions cuts need to fall, and suggests an overall cap, which the government can only reject in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>Starmer and Miliband have both already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/04/keir-starmer-vows-to-make-uk-climate-leader-again-labour-cop28-rishi-sunak\">taken to the world stage to claim global climate leadership for the UK</a>, so rejecting CCC advice would be a major departure. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “Britain is back in the business of climate leadership because the only way to protect current generations in the UK is by making Britain a clean energy superpower, and the only way to protect our children and future generations is by leading global climate action. We look forward to receiving the CCC’s expert advice and we will set our seventh carbon budget by June 2026, in line with our statutory duties.”</p>    <p>The first three carbon budgets were relatively easy to meet, as they mainly involved completing the switch from coal to gas that was begun in the 1990s, and investing in renewable energy, such as offshore wind.</p> <p>Labour has pushed further on energy, by ending the ban on onshore wind, boosting grants for heat pumps, and announcing new investments in carbon capture and storage and nuclear power.</p> <p>But other high-emitting sectors of the economy – transport, industry, buildings and farming – have made far less progress under recent governments. As a result, the UK is already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target\">badly off track to meet the current carbon budget</a> – the fourth, which runs to 2028.</p> <p>Emissions from transport – now the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6604460f91a320001a82b0fd/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-provisional-figures-statistical-release-2023.pdf\">biggest single source of the UK’s emissions, at about 29% in 2023</a> – have remained stubbornly high, as the gains from the uptake of electric vehicles have been offset by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/cars-growing-wider-europe-report\">surge in SUVs</a>, which now make up well over half of all new cars sold. Public transport has also yet to feel the benefits of renewed government focus, and aviation will be among the top sources of emissions in the 2040s, having been left out of previous budgets.</p> <p>Housing accounts for a fifth of emissions, and much faster progress is needed on phasing out gas boilers and plugging the leaks in the UK’s draughty housing. Roz Bulleid, research and policy director at the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Heat pumps and other forms of low-carbon heating will be rapidly replacing boilers in homes by the seventh carbon budget period.”</p> <p>Labour may also face resistance from farmers. Agriculture accounts for about 12% of the UK’s emissions, but farmers are up in arms over changes to inheritance tax, and concerned about the future of the public payments they receive, and any prospective trade deals. The National Farmers’ Union may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/18/labour-farmers-agriculture-budget-cliff-edge-nfu\">reconsider its target of reaching net zero by 2040 in England and Wales</a>. (Carbon budgets apply to the UK as a whole, but some aspects of them – including land use – are subject to devolution.)</p>    <p>Tom Lancaster, head of land, food and farming at the Energy Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, pointed to the findings of a CCC progress report that called for “substantial acceleration” in policy to reduce farming emissions, as it was “significantly off track”. ECIU analysis suggests that agriculture and land use could be the biggest emitting sector in the UK in just over a decade.</p> <p>Ministers would need to explain how they planned to resolve this, said Lancaster. “Issues such as land use, production and consumption of livestock products and demand-side policies are likely to feature more prominently [in the seventh carbon budget] than in previous carbon budget advice,” he warned.</p> <p>Starmer has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2024/nov/12/we-can-hit-uks-carbon-target-without-telling-people-how-to-live-their-lives-says-starmer-video\">fought shy of urging people to change their high-carbon habits</a>, perhaps fearful of “nanny state” jibes. But the question of the UK’s diet – meat-rich, and carbon-heavy as a result – cannot be ignored. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said it need not be a chore. “The deeper cuts needed<strong> </strong>to meet a 2040 goal can be met through more people choosing greener, cheaper and healthier lifestyles,” he said. “Already people are increasingly opting for meat and dairy alternatives and choosing to walk and cycle. The path to net zero should lead to better quality of life, particularly for those who have been left behind financially over the last decade.”</p> <p>Whatever his response to the CCC’s advice, Starmer can expect fierce attacks from the Conservatives. Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition, is a confirmed sceptic on net zero policy. She has so far stopped short of vowing to renege on the 2050 goal, but the carbon budget could provide her first big clash on the issue.</p> <p>This is a problem no government has faced before. In 2008, then leader of the opposition, David Cameron, commanded his MPs to vote for the Climate Change Act, and all but a handful did so. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/25/labour-urged-to-work-with-tories-to-counter-ignorant-climate-policy-attacks\">cross-party consensus on climate action</a> was the bedrock of his reformed Tory party, and it lasted all the way from his huskie-hugging expeditions of 2006 to the prime ministership of Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>The latter’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/20/rishi-sunak-confirms-rollback-of-key-green-targets\">partial rollback of several climate policies in September 2023</a> was the first sign of a crack in the consensus. If Badenoch takes issue with the CCC’s findings, or vows to unravel the carbon budget should the Tories take back power, it would be an unmistakable sign that the crack has become a chasm.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>As Nick Kyrgios returned to the singles court for just the second time in more than two years, he found himself digesting a dose of his own bitter medicine. No matter where he stood or which direction he shifted towards against the imperium serve of Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, aces continued to freely fly past him. At one point of their Brisbane International match, a brutal body serve crashed directly into him, stopping him in his tracks.</p> <p>The 7-6 (2), 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) scoreline after three inevitable tie-breaks was, in some ways, an extremely fitting result, with Kyrgios ending up on the wrong end. The last time the 29-year-old competed regularly on tour, he was one of the top two servers in the world, but the world of tennis moves quickly and time waits for no one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/tennis-novak-djokovic-nick-kyrgios-iga-swiatekn-aryna-sabalenka-new-season\">Djokovic and Kyrgios join forces to raise the curtain on new tennis season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having started 2024 ranked outside the top 200, Mpetshi Perricard blazed up the rankings, winning titles in Lyon and Basel, an ATP 500 event, and reaching the top 30. The 21-year-old’s success has been driven by his nuclear serve, which he freely fires down from his 2.03m (6ft 8in) frame.</p> <p>The power, accuracy and consistency behind his destructive first serve is spectacular enough but what further separates the French player is what he does with his second. Last year, Mpetshi Perricard <a href=\"https://www.atptour.com/en/news/mpetshi-perricard-serve-insights-2024-december#:~:text=Across%20three%20hours%20and%2021,big%20serve%20in%20pressure%20moments.\">averaged a blistering 135mph</a> behind his first serve and his second serve speeds were only marginally slower at 123mph. He tends to aim towards higher percentage targets and further from the lines on his second serve, but essentially plays with two first serves.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Frenchman’s serve dominance forced Kyrgios into an unfamiliar role. For once, the Australian had to be the cooler, steadier player. He fared well, keeping his opponent on the move and his error count low with precise, high-percentage ball striking.</p> <p>As he continues to nurse his recovering right wrist, which required attention from the doctor during the match, Kyrgios’s service speeds were considerably lower than two years ago but he still placed his serve well, took care of his own service games and swept up the vast majority of neutral exchanges. Aside from a soft warning from the umpire, he maintained his composure throughout.</p> <p>So much has happened since Kyrgios was last a regular fixture on the tour. In 2022, he enjoyed by far the best season of his career, reaching his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/10/novak-djokovic-crowned-wimbledon-champion-after-beating-nick-kyrgios\">first grand slam final</a> at Wimbledon after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/08/nick-kyrgios-wimbledon-for-any-kid-who-doubts-himself-just-keep-going\">Rafael Nadal withdrew</a> from the tournament before their scheduled semi-final. Just as it seemed that Kyrgios’s career was coming together, though, everything fell apart.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Kyrgios suffered from a variety of physical issues, including knee surgery and even a foot injury after an armed robbery in his home. It was, however, a significant wrist injury that left him unable to open bottles and fearing for his career. He secretly underwent an anatomical front and back wrist reconstruction last year.</p> <p>During his extended absence, Kyrgios pleaded guilty to an assault charge in 2023 for shoving his former girlfriend Chiara Passari during an argument. Magistrate Beth Campbell, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/feb/03/nick-kyrgios-pleads-guilty-to-assault-after-admitting-he-shoved-ex-girlfriend\">opted against convicting Kyrgios</a> due to her belief that the assault was “low-level”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/28/max-purcell-tennis-doping-ban-jordan-thompson-hits-out-ntwnfb\">‘A joke’: Jordan Thompson hits out at doping ban for doubles partner Max Purcell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More recently, Kyrgios has taken up numerous broadcasting jobs, from punditry to podcasting. He has been one of the most outspoken players on the tour after the announcements that Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek tested positive for banned substances. Despite his repeated comments on the issue, however, Kyrgios does not appear to have educated himself on the case by reading the published decisions.</p> <p>He departed the tennis court on Tuesday to a thunderous ovation from his home crowd, having shown that he remains at his best when focused and in full flow on-court. He finished the day satisfied with his performance and conscious of the significance of returning to professional tennis again after so long.</p> <p>“I’ve got six holes in my hand and one in my arm,” said Kyrgios. “Not one tennis player has ever had this surgery and come back and tried to play again. It’s all really experimental. The surgeon, [was] like: ‘If you ever go back and play at this level again, it’s on you guys.’ I don’t really have any protocol of how it’s going to be or how it’s going to pull up. So me and my physio, we are taking it as it comes. If we can get through a match, we get through a match. How it pulls up tomorrow, I have no idea. It’s throbbing right now.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic opened his season in Brisbane with a solid 6-3, 6-3 win over the home favourite Rinky Hijikata to set up a second-round match with Gaël Monfils. Aryna Sabalenka eased past Renata Zarazúa 6-4, 6-0.</p>",

He added: “Communities can continue to help us whilst we do remain under extreme pressure by only calling us when they really do need to and using the 111 service or accessing care from their pharmacist or GP where that’s appropriate.”</p> <p>The critical incident was declared on Monday evening at a point when about 350 emergency calls were waiting to be answered and more than half of the service’s vehicles were also waiting to hand over patients outside hospitals.</p> <p>Killens said: “I want to say sorry to patients who waited a very long time yesterday and continue to wait much longer than we would like this morning.”</p> <p>Asked if lives were being put at risk, he said: “There’s no doubt that regrettably some patients that have waited longer may have come to harm because of those waits but of course we always prioritise every single emergency call and respond to the sickest patients first.”</p> <p>Killens said: “This is certainly one of the worst periods I have seen. We’ve always seen pressure at winter because of flu and other respiratory viruses that are circulating but the last 24/48 hours have been particularly acute for us.”</p> <p>The Welsh ambulance service advised people on New Year’s Eve to:</p> <ul> <li><p>Consume alcohol in moderation, eating before they drink and alternating alcoholic beverages with soft drinks.</p></li> <li><p>Pre-arrange transport home, and never drive under the influence of drink or drugs.</p></li> <li><p>Avoid high-risk activities such as using fireworks – as well as burns, smoke inhalation from bonfires and fireworks can irritate respiratory conditions, including asthma.</p></li> </ul> <p>On Monday morning, before the critical incident was declared, the service said there had been a significant increase in the number of calls.</p> <p>Judith Bryce, the assistant director of operations, said: “The number of immediately life-threatening ‘red’ calls we’ve had in the last seven days remains very high, with the service receiving 1,716 calls compared with just 1,213 for the same period last year.</p> <p>“Demand has also increased significantly on our NHS 111 Wales service and has seen us answer over 1,200 more calls compared with the same week in 2023.”</p>",

Yes, as Jeremy Hunt gripped the red budget box for the last time, one tale of goodwill gripped our hearts – that of the good Samaritan who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/baby-hedgehog-hat-bobble-difficult-to-tell-the-difference\">mistook a rogue hat bobble</a> on a Cheshire pavement for a sickly hedgehog, and rushed it to animal A&amp;E.</p> <p>Lost? So was the little guy in question. He was found abandoned on the street in the middle of the day, far from his hedgehog family (a group of hedgehogs is called a prickle, FYI). Except, well, not quite.</p> <p>“The lady who brought it in was very frantic and worried because she’d kept it in a shoebox overnight but it hadn’t eaten or pooed,” says Janet Kotze, the manager of <a href=\"https://lowermosswood.com/\">Lower Moss Wood</a> wildlife hospital in Knutsford, Cheshire. The woman had lined the box with newspaper, given it a hot-water bottle and a blob of wet cat food for sustenance. Kotze – surprised at the weightlessness of the box – examined the little brown mound under the bright lights of the hospital’s triage room, only to discover that it wasn’t a hedgehog, it wasn’t even an animal – it was, in fact, the lopped-off top of a hat.</p> <p>The good Samaritan “couldn’t believe it when I told her”, says Kotze. Admittedly, it <em>was</em> hedgehog-coloured. But she didn’t stick around – after Kotze’s observation, she took the box and ran. (After Kotze had taken a photograph and circulated it to colleagues who would go on to share it on social media, obviously.) “I was just left behind, completely stunned,” Kotze says. </p> <p>The rescuer remained anonymous, but in the course of a few days the hospital achieved global fame. “I had people calling me from back home in South Africa asking: ‘What’s going on?’” says Kotze. The not-hedgehog was named Hedgebobble by hospital staff, and led to tens of thousands of Facebook likes and a cascade of donations to the centre. It was welcome, says Kotze.</p> <p>It also opened the floodgates for an outpouring of Spartacus-esque solidarity, with people fessing up to the weirdest objects they have carted off to an animal hospital. One women thought a bird-pecked fruit loaf in her garden was an animal, she told BBC Breakfast. Another scooped up some horse dung from the middle of the road thinking it was another poorly hedgehog.</p> <p>But, as with all viral news, what goes up must come down. “The donations were great for a while, but the story sort of ran out of steam,” says Kotze. “With the spiralling costs of energy and food, we’re still in dire straits.” As for the hedgebobble, Kotze is just comforted knowing that there are people out there who care. “There’s quite a lot of sadness in wildlife rescue, because by the time most animals are admitted it’s too late to save them. A heartwarming story was very much needed.” </p>",

            "body" : "<p>Not long after Jim Harbaugh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/24/jim-harbaugh-hired-la-chargers-coaching-job\">was hired in January</a> to coach the Los Angeles Chargers at a handsome $16m per season, he picked out the stalwarts on his roster. <em>Stalwarts </em>is not a typical football term, but Harbaugh loves stalwarts – those who are truly committed to the cause.</p> <p>The Chargers were coming off a 5-12 season in which head coach Brandon Staley was fired with three games to play, so it would figure that the quirky Harbaugh’s stalwart safari would not be too fruitful. But he found maybe 15 stalwarts, and there would be a great place to start.</p> <p>“And it’s grown since then,” Harbaugh said of all of his stalwarts at a news conference Saturday, after the Chargers (10-6) clinched an AFC playoff berth with a 40-7 victory at New England.</p> <p>Harbaugh, the 61-year-old former NFL quarterback, has been exceptional at turning around football teams, from the University of San Diego to Stanford University to the San Francisco 49ers to the University of Michigan, the undefeated national champions of college last year.</p> <p>The Chargers would be a tough challenge. In the 10 seasons prior to his arrival, they’d been in only three playoff games, two of which they lost. The team had moved to Los Angeles in 2017 from San Diego, where they’d built a fan base – a <em>stalwart</em> fan base – over 56 seasons.</p> <p>The Chargers play in the beautiful SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, but they share the facility with the Rams, who are also their landlords and who started playing in LA in 1946 (though they were in St Louis for 21 years). The Chargers don’t tend to drive NFL conversation.</p> <p>Those things did not matter to Harbaugh. For one, he had a very good quarterback, Justin Herbert. After the Chargers got Harbaugh, they hired Joe Hortiz from Baltimore as general manager, then Greg Roman, Harbaugh’s old pal, as offensive coordinator.</p> <p>The Chargers were 2-2 at their bye week but won five of their next six games, winning their last two games after they’d lost three of four. Harbaugh, a hard-nosed coach’s son who likes hard-nosed football, has been delighted with the team’s attitude.</p> <p>“There’s no coach who could have it better than coaching these players,” he said Saturday.</p> <p>“Nobody,” he added, before thinking about that for a second or two, then saying, “Maybe. The only one would be the future us [who] could have it better than us.”</p> <p>Harbaugh laughed at the way that sounded. As notable as his first season with the Chargers has already been, they all claim still to have things to work on. Harbaugh tries to downplay his role – “very little to do with me,” he said – but, with Hortiz’s help, Harbaugh forged a talented, not to mention formidable, team.</p> <p>Referring to Harbaugh and Hortiz, Herbert said, “They have done such a great job of getting the right guys here. You look in the locker room, and everybody plays for each other.”</p>    <p>Herbert called Harbaugh “a competitor, and he wants to win no matter what it is. It definitely shows, and it’s the way everyone fights for him, wants to play for him, and respects him.” Harbaugh called such teamwork “a powerful thing”.</p> <p>Herbert, the five-year veteran from Oregon, was considered among the NFL’s elite quarterbacks, especially after he led the Chargers to a 10-7 record and the playoffs two years ago. But his 2023 season ended four games early and in rather ignominious fashion: he broke his finger while trying to make a tackle after throwing an interception.</p> <p>Herbert has had a splendid season, with 21 touchdown passes against three interceptions and a 99.9 quarterback rating. The Chargers bulked up their offensive line and added a productive free-agent running back, JK Dobbins, who was hardly used in Baltimore. Rookie receiver Ladd McConkey, a second-round pick from Georgia, has 77 catches for 1,054 yards.</p> <p>Khalil Mack, the ravaging and punishing 33-year-old linebacker (not to mention one of Harbaugh’s stalwarts), returned for a third season to anchor LA’s defense, which is the hardest to score against in the NFL, giving up a mere 17.6 points per game.</p> <p>“I feel like we’ve been doing it the right way all along, and we’re starting to see results from the work we’ve been putting in,” Chargers safety Derwin James Jr said. “We know a new season is just beginning. We’re not settling with just being in the playoffs. We know where we want to be, what type of team we want to be. Man, we want to just keep going.”</p> <p>The Chargers have lost twice to NFL royalty, the Kansas City Chiefs, albeit by nine points total. Six of the Chargers’ 10 victories have come against opponents who have been eliminated from playoff contention. A 40-17 loss on 15 December to Tampa Bay was a low point.</p> <p>But Harbaugh has become the fifth coach in NFL history to win 10 games in his first season with two teams – the eighth coach in NFL history to make the playoffs in his first season with two teams. (The 49ers were 13-3 and made the NFC Championship Game in 2011.)</p> <p>Harbaugh said Saturday, pointing upwards, that “the hand of God” was on the Chargers, but this has been, he added, a team effort. He pledged that they will keep grinding. They might just end up playing Baltimore, coached by his older brother, John, in the playoffs. That would be a delightful, juicy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/31/superbowl-xlvii-john-jim-harbaugh\">repeat coaching matchup of Super Bowl XLVII</a>, won by the Ravens.</p> <p>This has not been a carefree season for him. Harbaugh experienced an irregular heartbeat in an October game against Denver, missing some plays in the first quarter. He said he would drink less Diet Coke, but he also said football is a tonic that keeps him feeling young.</p> <p>That seems like a good thing, because Jim Harbaugh’s hefty contract still has four more years to run. He pushes forward, but Part One was identifying some stalwarts on last year’s team, the bedrock for the “future us”.</p> <p>“It’s been their leadership that has motivated us, kept us going,” he said.</p> <p>“And also,” he added, “it’s the antidote for complacency.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>This deft Irish supernatural horror-cum-clairvoyant detective story delivers heavy frisson with minimal means: little more than the creepy recesses of a Grand Designs-style fixer-upper, a lifesize ventriloquist’s dummy howling to the furies, and some stringent performances. Also featuring occasional cutaways to a psychiatric hospital, it pays fealty to the gothic tradition, but is reminiscent of J-horror too in its antsy focus on an atmosphere of liminality that threatens to coalesce into something malevolent.</p> <p>Squatting inside the country pile she is renovating with her husband Ted (Gwilym Lee), who runs the local mental asylum, Dani (Carolyn Bracken) is confronted with one of his patients at her door one night. Despite his glass eye, the man claims to have spotted a shady interloper slip into the house behind her – and demands to be let in. A year later, it turns out Dani was bludgeoned to death, leaving her blind twin sister Darcy (Bracken again) wanting to know more. So she invites herself to the same house Ted now shares with his new girlfriend Yana (Caroline Menton) – but not before sending them a trunk containing a gift from her curiosity shop: the aforementioned mannequin from hell.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLNDvnv8B3A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tLNDvnv8B3A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Bracken excels in the paired roles, ostentatiously otherworldly as a white-haired, cream-clad clairvoyant where her sibling is totally normal. If one doppelganger wasn’t enough, Darcy – with her unblinking eyes and lack of niceties – also freakishly echoes the inanimate figure slumped in a chair. Not only does writer director Damian McCarthy handle these gothic effects sensitively, he also has a nice line in conversational scenes that ramp up tension and often end in Tarantinoesque whiplash. “Do I look stupid?” Yana replies to Darcy’s inquiry about whether she would let an unhinged man into the house. “I have no idea what you look like,” says Darcy. “But you sound stupid.”</p> <p>With the omnipresent mannequin and the eruptions of Dani’s revenant in the house, Oddity could have easily ended up a hollow genre exercise. But McCarthy manages to invest each twist with a substance that feels distinctively Irish and Catholic: namely, an interest in moral retribution and self-damnation. This carefully controlled and pointedly shot film takes a hoary old set of staples and cobbles together something admirably original.</p> <p>• Oddity is on digital platforms from 6 January.</p>",

There’s that constant fear – of having to live at the mercy of a good case officer to extend the visa, the constant cost of flights and medical examinations every year. It’s very inconvenient,” Baines said.</p> \n<p>Thomas Fuchs, a 64-year-old from Switzerland, has been waiting seven years for a parent visa, after being told the wait time would be as little as 18 to 24 months when he applied.</p> \n<p>Fuchs, who opened a hair salon employing and training Australians, came to Australia on a skilled 457 visa and was able to stay on a Covid bridging visa due to the fact he was self-sufficient. Without a parent visa he cannot access Medicare.</p> \n<p>“Usually parents are elderly, they don’t come here to open a business and work. We are in a bit of a different situation … but once you’re placed in a queue, nobody cares if you’re providing something [to Australia] or just coming in.</p> \n<p>“We’re worried if Peter Dutton gets into power and changes the [intake] figures, the whole process will be prolonged again.”</p> \n<p>A departmental spokesperson said: “All visa programs, regardless of whether there is a planning level in place, are subject to limited resourcing which can result in delays in application assessment, especially in periods of increased demand.</p> \n<p>“High volumes of permanent parent visa application lodgements, which for a number of years exceeded annual planning levels set for the program within the overall migration program, have impacted on processing times and the number of on-hand applications within these categories.”</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia contacted Dutton for comment.</p>",

            "body" : "<h2>Marcus Rashford</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 27 <strong>Nationality</strong> English <strong>Club</strong> Manchester United</p> <p>There appeared to be no way back for Rashford at Old Trafford after his declaration that he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/17/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-new-challenge\">“ready for a new challenge”</a>, with the Manchester United manager, Ruben Amorim, making it clear that he is not part of his plans. Yet he was back in the squad against Newcastle and, with a salary estimated at £300,000 a week, finding a new home may not be so easy. Paris Saint-Germain have a longstanding interest in Rashford and would be one of the few clubs who could afford to pay his wages, although it remains to be seen whether United would be prepared to subsidise some of the costs as they have done with Jadon Sancho’s loan to Chelsea.</p> <h2>Ben Chilwell</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 28 <strong>Nationality</strong> English <strong>Club</strong> Chelsea</p> <p>The England defender was left out of Chelsea’s Premier League and Conference League squads this season and has managed just 44 minutes so far as a substitute in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/24/chelsea-barrow-carabao-cup-match-report\">EFL Cup against Barrow</a> back in September. Unsurprisingly he and his fellow exile Carney Chukwuemeka were described by Enzo Maresca as “the first that want to leave” in January, although Chilwell – who cost Chelsea £50m from Leicester in 2020 – earns about £200,000 a week and may take some shifting. West Ham, Brentford and Marseille have been linked with the 28-year-old and he will be desperate not to spend another six months on the sidelines.</p> <h2>Rayan Cherki</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 21 <strong>Nationality</strong> French <strong>Club</strong> Lyon</p> <p>Lyon’s financial problems could force them to cash in on one of their prized assets, with the France Under-21s forward having been linked with Liverpool in recent weeks. A move to a club lower down the Premier League table seems more likely, however, with Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham thought to be among his suitors. Lyon’s Ernest Nuamah – the Ghana forward who was left in tears after his transfer to Craven Cottage in the summer collapsed on deadline day – is another potential target for English clubs.</p> <h2>Randal Kolo Muani</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 26 <strong>Nationality</strong> French <strong>Club</strong> Paris Saint-Germain</p> <p>The France forward has rarely been seen in Ligue 1 this season, having made only two starts under Luis Enrique and he is expected to leave PSG on loan in January. A host of Premier League big-hitters have been linked with Kolo Muani, with Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham said to be in the running for the 26-year-old, who remains a regular for his country under Didier Deschamps. His versatility and strength on the ball would make him a useful addition to any squad.</p> <h2>Matheus Cunha</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 25 <strong>Nationality</strong> Brazilian <strong>Club</strong> Wolves</p> <p>The attacker has been in red-hot form for Wolves despite their struggles this season but could he be the answer to help replace Bukayo Saka at Arsenal? The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/23/bukayo-saka-out-for-many-weeks-mikel-arteta-arsenal-injury-blow\">England forward’s hamstring injury</a> may well force Mikel Arteta into the market and Cunha would certainly provide a different option in attack, although there is an acknowledgment that prising him from Molineux while Wolves are fighting against relegation will take a hefty fee. That and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/21/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">return to form for Gabriel Jesus</a> may also rule out a move for Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres until the summer.</p> <h2>Antony</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 24 <strong>Nationality</strong> Brazilian <strong>Club</strong> Manchester United</p> <p>The much-maligned forward has racked up a grand total of 77 minutes in five substitute appearances in the Premier League so far this season and it is no surprise that Manchester United are hoping to loan him out. “If the club thinks it would be a good idea to loan Antony out in January so he can get more minutes and regain his trust, we will work together on that option,” said his agent, Junior Pedroso. A potential return to Ajax has been mooted for the player who cost a staggering £82m from the Dutch club in August 2022.</p>    <h2>Jonathan Tah</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 28 <strong>Nationality</strong> German <strong>Club</strong> Bayer Leverkusen</p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen are still in the running to retain their Bundesliga title yet Xabi Alonso’s side appear to be facing a losing battle to hold on to the Germany defender. Tah’s contract expires at the end of the season and he had been expected to join Bayern Munich on a free transfer in the summer. But Barcelona have also entered the race, with the 28-year-old reportedly expected to make a firm decision on his future in the coming weeks.</p> <h2>Milos Kerkez</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 21 <strong>Nationality</strong> Hungarian <strong>Club</strong> Bournemouth</p> <p>Kerkez has been one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/14/milos-kerkez-bournemouth-premier-league-football\">standout performers</a> in Bournemouth’s impressive rise up the table under Andoni Iraola, with the Hungary left-back having started every game so far in the Premier League. Liverpool and Manchester United have been heavily linked with a move for the 21-year-old who joined the south coast club from AZ Alkmaar in 2023 and is under contract until 2027. That means Bournemouth will probably demand about £50m for Kerkez, while interest is also rapidly growing in their teenage centre-back Dean Huijsen after his displays in recent weeks.</p>    <h2>Abdukodir Khusanov</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 20 <strong>Nationality</strong> Uzbek <strong>Club</strong> Lens</p> <p>There has yet to be an Uzbekistan international in the Premier League but that could change in January. The 20-year-old central defender began his career at Bunyodkor in his homeland before arriving in France via a spell in Belarus. He is thought to be on the radar of Manchester City, Tottenham, Leicester and Newcastle thanks to some impressive performances for Will Still’s side at the heart of a three-man defence. “He’s a monster, he scares me,” said the Lens captain, Brice Samba. “For his age, what he does … ”</p> <h2>Romain Esse</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 19 <strong>Nationality</strong> English <strong>Club</strong> Millwall</p> <p>The 19-year-old England youth international could become one of the few players to make the move across south London from Millwall to Crystal Palace if Oliver Glasner’s side follow up their interest, although they face competition from Nottingham Forest. Esse, a winger who has started all but one of his side’s games in the Championship this season having come through the academy, signed a new contract in August but that is believed to contain a release clause of about £12m. A brilliant goal against Norwich on Boxing Day will only fuel speculation he could depart the Den.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Here are our bold predictions for 2025 in sports. Please note the <em>bold</em> (or should that be <strong>bold</strong>?) in bold predictions: these are mostly to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p> <h2>LeBron joins the Saudi Basketball League</h2> <p>LeBron James’ <a href=\"https://x.com/KingJames/status/1683634303203422209\">tongue-in-cheek reaction</a> to Kylian Mbappé’s rejection of a $776m offer from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal might have seemed innocuous enough. As did subsequent responses from <a href=\"https://x.com/Money23Green/status/1683642982463950848\">Draymond Green</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2023/08/21/giannis-antetokounmpo-lebron-james-saudi-arabia-liv-golf-nba-merger-money/\">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>. But you have to believe the NBA was at least a <em>little</em> nervous when the Kid from Akron <a href=\"https://x.com/KSAbasket/status/1699099409068298478\">paid a visit to the Kingdom</a> six weeks later at the behest of the Saudi Ministry of Sport.</p> <p>Whether the NBA’s all-time scoring leader joins the 49-year-old Saudi Basketball League on a one-year contract (for, say, $800m?) depends entirely on whether Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – valued at an estimated $650bn – expresses an open interest in jumping into basketball, which to date they have not. But after seeing how those bottomless coffers have disrupted one traditionally Western sport after another in an unprecedented demonstration of soft power – from soccer to golf to Formula One to boxing to women’s tennis to horse racing to professional wrestling – it seems almost naive to believe that basketball’s day won’t one day come. The idea of a quadragenarian King James taking his talents to Umluj Beach is no more daft than Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar joining the Saudi Pro League might have sounded only a few years ago. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> <h2>The NFL announces a London team</h2> <p>It’s no secret the National Football League has been planting the seeds for a franchise to move to London since before the International Series began in 2007. We’ve had an expansion of games played, a stadium in Tottenham designed to meet league regulations and, most importantly, the UK is said to have <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/most-popular-nfl-teams-uk-213000223.html\">more than 14m fans of American football</a>. Granted, not all are avid fans, but there are more than enough to surpass the 6m fan threshold the league set for a permanent franchise to be viable. Buckle up, folks, because 2025 is the year the NFL finally announces that one lucky franchise will be moving to London by 2028. I can’t predict the team but can forecast the news will cause massive turmoil. <strong>Melissa Jacobs</strong></p> <h2>The Leafs end their 58-year Cup hoodoo</h2> <p>Humanity was still two years away from the first moon landing when the Toronto Maple Leafs last reached the Stanley Cup final, beating the Montreal Canadiens under the management of George “Punch” Imlach. Admittedly, back in 1966-67 the NHL had only six teams; now there are 32. Still, this marathon streak of futility is one of the most extraordinary inadvertent feats in North American sports, especially given the team’s enduring appeal and financial power.</p> <p>The Leafs are the league’s most valuable team, worth $3.8bn <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/nhl/nhl-franchise-values-2024/5996642/#:~:text=The%20highest-valued%20NHL%20team,over%20the%20second-highest%20team.\">according to CNBC</a>. If the Blue Jays, Toronto FC and the Raptors can win fairly recent titles in a metro area of nearly 7m people, surely so can the Leafs, who are currently well placed in their division and have a star goalscorer in William Nylander. Yes, there has been mismanagement down the years. But at some point, isn’t a decent group of players like this one going to get lucky and fluke it till they make it? The Leafs, like Nasa, are due another giant leap. <strong>Tom Dart</strong></p>    <h2>The WNBA surpasses the NBA in viewership</h2> <p>The WNBA, the <a href=\"https://pro.morningconsult.com/analyst-reports/fastest-growing-brands-report-2024\">world’s fastest-growing brand</a>, shows no signs of slowing at a time when NBA viewership is down. The women’s league averaged 1.2m viewers per game in 2024, a 115% increase over 2023. With the NBA averaging just 1.6m – half its numbers from last year – the WNBA overtaking the NBA in average viewers next year is possible.</p> <p>The WNBA finals matching the NBA finals viewership remains a stretch. This year’s Liberty-Lynx finals averaged 1.6m viewers, a 20-year high, but far from the 11.3m who watched the Celtics defeat the Mavericks. Still, scenarios involving Caitlin Clark and the Fever could shift the landscape. Clark’s NCAA championship game drew 18.9m viewers, and a Fever finals appearance – especially against the Liberty, Aces, or Lynx – could push viewership into record territory.</p> <p>Whether the Fever reach the finals depends on the draft (Sonia Citron could be a transformative pick) and how Clark’s sophomore season pans out. Other teams also delivered major wins in 2024, proving that WNBA success isn’t all about Clark – though her impact can’t be overstated. <strong>Stephanie Kaloi</strong></p> <h2>Sports leagues retreat from political activism</h2> <p>In his first term Trump let fly with his hottest sports takes, hitting out at Colin Kaepernick and the other pros at pains to demonstrate against police brutality and racial injustice during the national anthem and in competition – and Kaepernick et al <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/09/donald-trump-us-sports-election\">weren’t shy about hitting back</a>. But with many of Trump’s past critics in the political and corporate arenas swiftly cowed into anticipatory obedience since his emphatic reelection victory, America’s sports leagues and sponsors will be far more obsequious this time around, especially now that X– an official podium for so many in sports – is official property of Elon Musk, the shadow president. And then there are sports like golf, which are heartily cheering the president-elect’s return in hopes that he might un-muddle the mess they’ve made with his Saudi friends.</p> <p>The days of championship teams skipping White House visits? That’s through. The days of LeBron James, sport’s most outspoken star, trading barbs with Trump? Also through. In fact, the Lakers legend’s muted endorsement of Kamala Harris and post-election social media sabbatical declaration suggests even he sees the writing on the wall: any talk of politics in sports will soon be a one-way street. <strong>Andrew Lawrence</strong></p> <h2>Athlete activism makes a comeback</h2> <p>Athlete activism, which peaked in 2020 and 2021 after the death of George Floyd, will make a comeback this year. This time, the leagues and organizations will struggle even more than they did four to five years ago to appease their athletes, many of whom were beginning their careers during the last wave, while avoiding condemnation from a White House whose tolerance for dissent may be hitting a 50-year low. <br><br>Protests might not include kneeling for the national anthem, which may not have been the most effective means of getting points across. But athletes will use their social media might to speak up against any injustices that arise. We may see more athletes in Pride marches. Some athletes may wear political T-shirts in place of the flashy suits that have turned their arrivals at stadiums into a red-carpet occasion. <br><br>The bravest and perhaps unlikeliest protest would be in the UFC, where president Dana White has forgotten or forgiven the Trump family’s rival MMA promotion several years ago and has, along with conspiracy theorist podcaster and UFC commentator Joe Rogan, treated Donald Trump like a Roman emperor at gladiator bouts. Athletes have, in the past, expressed some opinions that don’t fall in line. Would a UFC fighter dare to speak out against White’s buddy in a post-fight interview? <strong>Beau Dure</strong></p>    <h2>The Spurs spring a massive NBA playoff upset</h2> <p>Victor Wembanyama continues to dazzle, showcasing his otherworldly talent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/25/nba-christmas-2024-games-scores\">on Christmas Day</a> as the San Antonio Spurs faced the newly Karl-Anthony Towns-enhanced Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Though the Spurs ultimately fell short after a late New York comeback, Wembanyama was the star of the show, dropping 42 points, grabbing 19 rebounds and blocking four shots – just two points shy of Wilt Chamberlain’s Christmas debut record.</p> <p>Watching Wembanyama, it’s easy to dream of a future where the 7ft3in French phenom dominates as Chamberlain once did, perhaps even averaging 50 points per game. His brilliance highlights the Spurs’ upward trajectory amid a shifting NBA landscape where Golden State and the Lakers appear to be on the decline. With the postseason looking increasingly likely for San Antonio, the team could accelerate its ascent with a bold move, such as acquiring a player like De’Aaron Fox. A first-round upset against a contender like Oklahoma City isn’t out of the question and with Wembanyama at the helm, the Spurs’ potential seems boundless and ahead of schedule. <strong>David Lengel</strong></p> <h2>The NBA changes its rules around three-pointers</h2> <p>The NBA will implement a rule change aimed at reducing three-point attempts. The alarming decline in TV ratings has put pressure on commissioner Adam Silver to address the issue. Currently, teams average an all-time high of 36 three-point attempts per game, with most utilizing a five-out alignment, leaving the post empty and even centers stretching the floor with three-point shooting. Some of the proposed solutions – I have yet to hear one that I like – include removing the corner three-point line or capping the number of three-point attempts per team before subsequent shots are only worth two. A change seems inevitable. The real question is whether Silver will opt for a subtle adjustment or a more drastic overhaul. <strong>Nicholas Levine</strong></p> <h2>The NCAA surrenders the ‘amateurism’ model</h2> <p>Since the US supreme court ruled in 2021 that college athletes could make money off of their “name, image and likeness”, the NCAA model of “amateurism” – the classification of college athletes as full-time students and part-time athletes – was doomed to fail. In October, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/24/ncaa-settlement-conferences-paying-players\">settlement worth nearly $3bn</a> was granted preliminary approval by a federal judge. Though there are hurdles before the era of amateurism ends, the NCAA might determine that the chaos engulfing its billion-dollar enterprise is no longer worth the terrible press it endured in 2024.</p> <p>A week after announcing the historic settlement, the NCAA reached a different settlement with the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-state-coalition-restore-competition-college-athletes-ncaa-division-i\">that ended all restrictions for athletes seeking to transfer schools</a>. And in July, a federal appeals court ruled in a separate case that college athletes may qualify as employees under federal wage-and-hour laws. Because the NCAA maintains that college athletes are students and not employees, the athletes and their representatives are negotiating contracts with “collectives”, loose consortiums of donors that pool money to pay the athlete in exchange for small commitments off the field like advertising or charity work.</p> <p>In September, UNLV quarterback Matt Sluka <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5803997/2024/10/01/college-football-nil-matt-sluka-unlv-ncaa/\">left the team after starting the year 4-0</a> and claimed that he was not paid the money he was promised. Representatives from the school indicated there was no such promise and that Sluka was merely trying to renegotiate his contract in the middle of the season. On Monday, UConn football coach Jim Mora suggested that schools and coaches <a href=\"https://x.com/CoachJimMoraFB/status/1873742768075571608?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">are wantonly violating in-season tampering rules</a> and that the NCAA should improve its enforcement.</p> <p>After decades of complete control over its athletes, the NCAA and its affiliated universities have lost virtually all of its bargaining power to athletes who are free to negotiate and re-negotiate contracts without restriction, but not with the universities themselves. Long a tightly-controlled cartel, the NCAA is now a barely regulated free market. The ensuing chaos of the new era will soon bring an end to the mirage of amateurism that denied generations of athletes a cut of the NCAA’s billions. <strong>Gabriel Baumgaertner</strong></p>",

            "body" : "<p>In Chris Bush and Richard Hawley’s musical, <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/standing-at-the-skys-edge/\">Standing at the Sky’s Edge</a>, there’s an exchange that has stuck in my mind. The scene is Sheffield’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/07/park-hill-from-brutalist-glory-to-sink-estate-to-contentious-regeneration\">Park Hill housing estate</a> at Christmas 2002. The postwar estate was once a place of modernity, civic pride and hope, but it is now run down and decaying. There are rats in the flats.</p> <p>Jimmy, a young security guard, and Joy, a nurse, still live in Park Hill. They talk constantly about finding a better future and a fresh start for themselves. But where could they go to do that, Joy asks? To Mars? “No,” Jimmy insists: “A proper fresh start. Clean slate. Australia.”</p> <p>Joy is unconvinced. But Jimmy presses on. “Why not? I know a couple of lads who did. You can nurse anywhere. I’d find something. This time next year. Christmas on the beach.”</p> <p>It is not too much of a spoiler, I hope, to reveal that Jimmy and Joy never make it to Australia. But the exchange is resonant because it articulates a dimension of the British mind-map that existed very strongly in the years before 2002, especially during the imperial decades, and while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/annie-white-australia-policy\">White Australia immigration policy</a> was in force – until 1973.</p> <p>Today, the White Australia policy is long gone, immigration of all kinds to Australia is much more restricted, and the country has mostly shaken off any remaining deference towards Britain. Yet a certain idea of Australia still lingers strongly at the back of the British mind today, many years later, as a place where one can live a British life, but more prosperously and with better weather.</p> <p>In spite of all the changes, it’s an idea of Australia that gets a boost whenever there’s a suggestion in Britain that Australia is becoming a mecca for British emigrants. “Young Britons flocking to Australia for a better life,” <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/eb861f0d-494e-4ad2-a2f7-4df8b0d8ee3d?shareToken=bced857fa4ebac5c9a7e58f8cab46ef1\">announced</a> one story this week.<strong> </strong>“We are here to steal your workers,” announced a Western Australian trade delegation in 2023, triggering a flurry of <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/article/australia-to-lure-workers-to-a-new-life-in-the-sun-jgk3r0fmv\">“new life in the sun” headlines</a>. It’s an idea that rests on assumptions that we don’t often think about or discuss, and which are in many ways now an anachronism.</p> <p>What stayed with me when I heard Jimmy’s speech imagining Christmas on the beach in Australia is how much of what he was expressing was a specifically British daydream. His words were predicated on the existence of an alternative anglophone world in which it is easy for British people to imagine themselves living, with more rewards and fewer disappointments.</p>    <p>Of course, it was not inconceivable that a French or Italian equivalent of Jimmy or Joy might also think about making “a proper fresh start” somewhere else too. But the more you think about the wider European experience, the more you realise that this option is far more easily accessible to British people than to others. The dream of finding a better life in a place where they already speak your language and where daily habits are familiar is one that few other nations can match so readily.</p> <p>Of course, many other European countries had overseas empires, too – but these were either more distant in history compared with the British empire, were less enduring or smaller, or involved less emigration for settlement.</p> <p>France had a large empire too, but the francophone world today is smaller and less powerful than the anglophone. So are the global residues of the Dutch, the Danish and the Belgian empires. Spain once had a huge Latin American empire, but it is more than 200 years since most of it collapsed and emigration there from Spain is now slight. Portugal’s empire lasted longer, but Brazil long ceased to be a leading destination for the Portuguese.</p> <p>The other huge factor is that the US speaks English too. Things might have been different if France had won the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\">seven years’ war</a> – as a visit to the <a href=\"https://www.afar.com/places/musee-de-lamerique-francophone-quebec-city\">Musée de l’Amérique Francophone</a> in Québec City poignantly illustrates. But it was the English speakers who prevailed. This gave the British – who then included the Irish – a powerful extra incentive. Even before the first world war, there was far more <a href=\"https://www.gale.com/intl/essays/amy-j-lloyd-emigration-immigration-migration-nineteenth-century-britain#:~:text=Between%201815%20and%201914%2C%20approximately,by%20Ireland%2C%20Norway%20and%20Italy.\">British emigration to the US</a> each year than to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</p> <p>Even in the 20th century, there was something substantive<strong> </strong>to those connections. The historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._A._Pocock\">JGA Pocock</a>, a New Zealander himself, called such white Commonwealth countries “neo-Britains”. His fellow historian AJP Taylor, a radical in many ways, nevertheless waxed lyrical with the claim, written in the pro-empire Sunday Express, that “Millions of people in Canada, in Australia and in New Zealand are our relations by blood. When they or their ancestors left this country, they did not cease to be British. They went to the colonies or the Dominions in order to remain British.”</p> <p>Views like that can sound absurd today, not least in a United Kingdom that struggles to agree on what Britishness is, and whose union has been under such threat in recent years. But they were common in the 20th century, and they lingered on in Jimmy and Joy’s glum assessment of their prospects in Sheffield when compared with Christmas on the beach. And they linger on today, not least for those who gravitate to Australia in such numbers on gap-year trips, or to watch an Ashes test.</p> <p>Every former imperial state struggles to adapt to its post-imperial circumstances. They do so, however, in very different ways. Emmanuel Macron’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/emmanuel-macron-swears-amid-furious-exchange-with-cyclone-hit-mayotte-islanders\">pre-Christmas arguments</a> with inhabitants of Mayotte, the tiny French island possession 5,000 miles from Paris in the Mozambique channel, which was devastated by a cyclone earlier this month, demonstrated a distinctly French way of getting it wrong.</p> <p>Yet the psychological need of some Britons – especially white ones, albeit fewer now than before – to cling to the long-outmoded belief that countries such as Australia are still neo-Britains is a distinctly British example of the same failure. So too is the even more outlandish fantasy, not wholly absent from arguments about how Britain should respond to Donald Trump’s return, that the US is such a nation too.</p> <p>Millions of Britons today certainly want a fresh start and a clean slate, just like Jimmy and Joy. But they will find it at home, not on the beach in Australia. That’s one of the many forms of escapism on which Britons should learn to turn their backs. They will only find a fresh start that lasts, if they can find it at all, in communities like Sheffield and in the renovation of places like the Park Hill estate.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

But a recent exchange programme trip to San Francisco got her thinking she might be gay or bi, especially after a semi-chaste tryst with another young woman of her age. As the new school term starts, Lily’s friend Violet (Venetia Bowe) offers to “go lezzer” with Lily, and the two start snogging in the toilet – only to almost get caught by their peers. Keen to hold on to her popular-girl status, Violet makes out that Lily had been the more sexually aggressive and soon other kids are bullying Lily; she starts withdrawing, staying home from school and self-harming.</p> <p>Only Lily’s friend Simon (Dean Quinn), the only out gay boy in the village, offers support. That includes taking her up to Dublin for a night out where they meet Oonagh (Amy-Joyce Hastings) who grumpily serves as their queer sensei, offering understanding, advice and reassurance that it will all be fine, more or less. Practically moments later, Simon and Lily fall in with a shady gay brother and sister team who take the younger kids to bed, which is definitely dodgy given the implied age difference and the fact that the siblings let a voyeuristic older man watch them making out because he pays them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBx2niJNudU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RBx2niJNudU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is all more or less the beginning of a plot packed with melodramatic incident and issue-driven drama, from characters afflicted with gay panic, bigoted and alcoholic parents, older lovers torn apart by misaligned life goals, and suicide attempts. It is as if someone condensed a whole season of Euphoria but with more Guinness drinking. But even if it is all a bit overcooked, one can’t gainsay the sincerity of the performances, especially from Harte who makes for a convincingly confused teen. Quinn is also charming as her wise-cracking bestie, displaying impish comic timing throughout. Not all the performances are up to the same standard, but it would be like drowning puppies to pick out offenders in a work so much on the side of the angels.</p> <p>• Who We Love is on digital platforms from 6 January.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>England’s health ombudsman has criticised the service’s care regulator for failing to properly investigate the death of a five-year-old boy in a specialist unit.</p> <p>The boy’s foster mother – an NHS doctor – has accused the care provider that looked after him of instigating “a cover-up” of how he died and frustrating her efforts to get to the truth.</p> <p>The ombudsman has criticised the Care Quality Commission (CQC) for failing to act on evidence that emerged at the inquest into the boy’s death that cast doubt on the trust’s version of events.</p> <p>The ruling by Rebecca Hilsenrath, the ombudsman, is another blow to the credibility of the CQC, which the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/26/englands-health-watchdog-not-fit-for-purpose-says-wes-streeting\">Wes Streeting, in July declared to be “not fit for purpose</a>”.</p> <p>The case shows that the various regulators that monitor the health sector need to ensure that when mistakes are made the care provider displays transparency and accountability, Hilsenrath said.</p> <p>The ombudsman did not name the boy. He had neurodisabilities and lived in Sheffield with his foster parents, who had looked after him since he was six months old. He was found dead in his cot one morning in May 2017, six weeks into a stay at a specialist residential children’s home in Tadworth, Surrey, run by <a href=\"https://www.thechildrenstrust.org.uk/about?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiApsm7BhBZEiwAvIu2X_b2PORmBLnb00McgwfjLYFEhFGW69TMt0mZuJO2Ivrjk05jEaiR4BoCtAAQAvD_BwE\">the Children’s Trust</a>, a charity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/14/nhs-failing-to-learn-from-fatal-sepsis-mistakes-watchdog-warns\">NHS failing to learn from fatal sepsis mistakes, watchdog warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He had been doing well and had no major underlying physical or medical concerns. At first, the CQC believed his death had been natural, based on what the charity had told it.</p> <p>But the inquest into his death found it had occurred after a loose padded bumper around his cot, to stop injuries or falls, had become dislodged and wedged under his neck. It found that he had died “following entrapment by a loose cot bumper causing death by way of airway obstruction”.</p> <p>The boy’s foster mother, who asked to remain anonymous, complained to the CQC and, dissatisfied with its response, raised her concerns with the ombudsman.</p> <p>“When things go wrong in care there should be accountability and lessons must be learned. If that doesn’t happen, grieving families suffer the added pain of having to fight harder to get the answers they’re looking for,” Hilsenrath said.</p> <p>“Regulatory organisations must make sure they examine all the available evidence to uncover the truth for everyone involved and to prevent others from experiencing the same trauma.”</p> <p>Dr Karen Henderson, the coroner who heard the inquest, was so concerned by the evidence presented about the Children’s Trust’s behaviour that she issued a prevention of future deaths report – a legal warning that dangers of the same events occurring must be eradicated to protect patients.</p> <p>In the report, she highlighted that police and coronial staff who attended the trust soon after the boy died “were not fully informed of the circumstances of his death”. For example, they were not told what position his body was found in, that he had been dead “for some time” or that the bumper had been found across his neck.</p> <p>The trust “have not acknowledged there was a lack of transparency and openness into how [the boy] died or that the trust did not properly investigate his death or inform the relevant statutory bodies of the circumstances of his death”, the coroner added.</p> <p>After the inquest, the Children’s Trust said it accepted the coroner’s findings and apologised to the boy’s family. In a statement at the time, it said: “Our senior leadership team has established an action group dedicated to developing new processes and systems that will address the coroner’s concerns.</p> <p>“This is in addition to measures we had already put in place in the last five years since [the boy’s] death; including new beds and cots, and changes to our overnight monitoring policy.”</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, the boy’s foster mother said: “I think there’s no doubt that there’s been a cover-up [by the trust]. I feel really angry. I feel like [her son’s] life didn’t matter.</p> <p>“The CQC should have been much more curious. As a doctor, I’m used to dealing with the CQC. But I have lost trust in an organisation that should be doing its utmost to make sure that places that look after vulnerable people are safe. They didn’t see that things weren’t adding up here.</p> <p>“It felt like the CQC were there to protect the trust and its reputation. It’s only the ombudsman that’s got me answers, because they wouldn’t give me any answers.”</p> <p>James Bullion, the CQC’s chief inspector of adult social care and integrated care, acknowledged that the regulator had let the boy’s family down.</p> <p>“Everyone has the right to expect safe, high-quality care and a regulator that they can trust to act in their and their loved one’s interest. We fell short in this case and we are deeply sorry for the impact this has had on this young boy’s family.”</p> <p>• The headline and main text of this article were amended on 3 January 2025 to refer to Rebecca Hilsenrath as “England’s health ombudsman”, not “the NHS ombudsman” as an earlier version said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It was a freezing December day when mountain guide Kingsley Jones first saw a rescue monk in action. He was leading a small group up the ominously named Combe des Morts when he passed by a rescue hut – one of many that dot this avalanche-prone area – and noticed a woman inside struggling in the freezing cold. He offered his assistance and she told him she’d already phoned for help. And it soon arrived, in the form of an Augustine monk – on skis, equipped with a hot flask of grenadine and warm layers, who escorted her to the safety of nearby <a href=\"https://gsbernard.com/\">Hospice du Grand St Bernard</a>, a monastery and travellers’ hostel on Col du Mont-Joux at 2,473m.</p> <p>This kind of rescue has taken place in the mountain passes around Col du St Bernard on the Swiss-Italian border since 1050. And despite the changes in outdoor gear, modes of rescue and avalanche locator technology over the centuries, the hospice (set up by St Bernard of Aosta to offer refuge to pilgrims walking the Via Francigena pilgrim path from Canterbury to Rome) has remained largely unchanged.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The hospice was set up to offer refuge to pilgrims walking the Via Francigena pilgrim path from Canterbury to Rome</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The day I head there was free of rescue drama, though freezing cold at around -20C. My friend Dan and I had hired a car from Geneva and left it in the Super St Bernard car park just before Italian customs. It wasn’t my first time here in winter – that had been over a decade earlier, with a group and guide like Kingsley. But this time – having done more snowshoeing and winter skills courses in the interim, and with our own transceivers and snow shovels and after checking avalanche conditions – we set off for the hospice alone.</p>    <p>Two years ago, I came here in summer, too, and found the roads (now plastered in thick sparkling snow) filled with coachloads of tourists. Yet for seven months of the year (from November to May) only skiers or snowshoers are able to visit, and the atmosphere out on the mountains and inside the hospice is transformed into a silent place of contemplation.</p> <p>The Combe des Morts was so named because of the high risk of avalanche, and why Bernard of Menthon set up the monastery here – with the doors always open for those in need seeking shelter.</p> <p>On the day Dan and I set out, it was sunny with little wind, and we moved fast. Before long, we passed the rescue hut where a ceramic sign attached to the stone walls reads: “St Bernard guide nos pas”.</p> <p>Bernard died in 1081, and in 1681 was canonised, becoming the patron saint of mountaineers. After our three-mile walk in, the white walls of the hospice appeared, a statue of St Bernard alongside, with the devil shackled in chains at his feet – representing the mastering of perils that Alpinists face.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Bernard died in 1081, and in 1681 was canonised, becoming the patron saint of mountaineers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kingsley has been leading trips to the hospice for more than 25 years with <a href=\"https://www.icicle-mountaineering.ltd.uk/grand+saint+bernard+snowshoeing.html\">Icicle Mountaineering</a>, based in the Lake District, and before my trip he told me that the type of people coming has changed during that time.</p> <p>“It used to only be skiers – mainly Swiss and older people,” he said. “But then snowshoers started coming, the crowds slowly got younger too, with many between 20 and 30. Now even some families make the journey and the North Americans seem to have heard about it as well.”</p> <p>While many used to view the hostel as a functional base from which to climb nearby Mount Fourchon and the surrounding peaks, today it’s the spiritual aspect of it that seems to appeal to most, Kingsley said: “Going in through that hospice door, walking past the rescue sledges still used as they would have been in the 11th century, is incredibly atmospheric and appeals to a large cross section of people.” </p>    <p>When Dan and I arrived there was already a party of Swiss ski-mountaineers sipping sweet tea, pouring over maps, a group of Britons with a guide, and a lady and her partner from the US (the hostel sleeps about 80 across two floors). Three resident monks (known as canons) are here during the winter, as well as a handful of lay volunteers. I chat to one, Pascal, in his mid-20s and from France, who came here for some time out to think about what to do next with his life.</p> <p>After a meal of hot soup followed by a simple serving of meat and two veg, it was time for mass. As a non-religious soul, I wouldn’t normally sit through it, but up here, held in a simple, stone underground crypt with thick walls offering protection from the snowstorm building outside, I couldn’t resist. With only schoolgirl French, I didn’t understand most of what was said, but the softly spoken words and monks’ song were incredibly soothing. Afterwards, I headed straight to my dorm, cocooning myself in the thick blankets and notice how little things have changed since my last visit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>St Bernard rescue dogs were bred here since at least the early 1700s, but with the advent of thermal imaging cameras and helicopters, they became superfluous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The next day, after we’d wandered to the Col Ouest de Barasson and back to peer down from Switzerland into Italy, Pascal showed us the onsite food stores with giant truckles of local cheese and wine (Napoleon and his men are said to have drunk more than 22,000 bottles of it in 1800 – racking up a bill that was only paid in 1984 by then French president François Mitterrand). Afterwards, one of the monks led us to the attic where a small museum charts the history of the building and it’s even more famous former residents – the St Bernard rescue dogs.</p>    <p>Bred here since at least the early 1700s (when records began), the dogs were adept at sniffing out people buried in avalanches and their image has found its way into books, paintings and cartoons. With the advent of thermal imaging cameras and helicopters, these 70kg residents became superfluous and too expensive to keep here, but they still have a home down the mountain in Martigny at Barryland – a breeding kennels and visitors centre – and get to come back to visit every summer and meet the many tourists. In winter, the only specimen is a stuffed St Bernard from 1800, which is said to have saved more than 40 lives.</p> <p>On the final morning it’s a wrench to leave. I’ve spent as long reading by the window and watching the snow fall, as I have hiking, and I feel strangely refreshed.</p> <p>As we walk back through the snow, I recall a line from St Bernard’s prayer: “After having enjoyed the beauty of nature, we return to our duty more cheerful and stronger.” Having spent a comfortable weekend in this frozen wonderland, surrounded by history, mountain lovers and rescue monks, I don’t need to be a Catholic to say “Amen” to that.</p> <p><em>Icicle </em><em>offers a guided </em><em>three-day/</em><em>two-night </em><em> <a href=\"https://www.icicle-mountaineering.ltd.uk/grand+saint+bernard+snowshoeing.html\">snowshoeing to Grand St Bernard Hopsice</a> experience from £549pp. Phoebe Smith is author of Wayfarer: Love, Loss and Life on Britain’s Ancient Paths, available from the <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wayfarer-9780008566524/\">Guardian Bookshop</a> and </em><em>shortlisted for the Edward Stanford Travel Book of the Year 2025</em></p> <p><br></p>",

            "body" : "<p>Whether New Year’s Eve is spent watching fireworks, celebrating at a pub, club or party, or eating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/31/new-years-eve-around-the-world\">grapes for good luck</a>, more and more people across the UK are dining out for the occasion as trends shift from club nights to experiences.</p> <p>Eating in restaurants on New Year’s Eve is on the rise. It increased in 2023 by 17% year on year, according to the online booking platform OpenTable, making it one of the most popular days to eat out after Mother’s Day.</p> <p>Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, said New Year’s Eve was one of the “biggest nights in the hospitality calendar”, and though the ways in which people celebrated had changed over the years, the same could be expected as the industry prepared to welcome in 2025.</p> <p>“New Year’s Eve is always one of the biggest nights in the hospitality calendar, and this year will be no different,” she said. “The traditional night out in bars and clubs or a meal out with family and friends remain popular, but as hospitality has evolved, so have the options available for consumers.”</p> <p>Changing trends had brought a rise in “experiential leisure” at some venues, she said. Activities including darts, golf and cricket “have grown in popularity and will likely be more popular this year, and in years to come”.</p> <p>However, this shift can not be solely put down to a demand for experiences. Over the last few years, the night-time industry has been in crisis: nightclubs across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/27/calls-to-save-the-uks-ailing-nightclub-industry-after-another-year-of-closures\">have had to shut their doors</a> due to the cost of living, high running costs and dwindling footfall. Many were also severely affected by the lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, with clubs often the last venues to reopen, but the industry has been in decline for more than a decade.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/ntia-hosted-pdfs/ntia-nte-report-2024.pdf\">report</a> by the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), a trade body representing businesses in the night-time economy, revealed there were only 851 remaining nightclubs in the UK in 2023, compared with over 3,000 in 2005. As of June 2024, this has shrank further to 786, according to figures from the analysts CGA by NIQ and AlixPartners.</p>    <p>The “culmination of pandemic debt, growing energy bills, workforce challenges, supply chain issues, insurance premiums and landlord pressures” had contributed to slowing ticket sales and visitor frequency at these venues, the NTIA said. There had also been a shift towards experience-led socialising, the body added, showing the inherent resilience and dynamism of the sector.</p> <p>According to DesignMyNight, there is still an appetite for club nights. However, this had shifted from the more “traditional” club night out, said Leighanne Bent, the booking platform’s marketing manager. For instance, there was a 415% increase in tickets available for bottomless drinks events in 2024 compared with the previous year. </p> <p>“Since the pandemic there’s been quite a decline in searches for ‘clubbing’ events on New Year’s Eve, with other venues becoming more popular,” she said. “This year rooftop events are having a real moment, with venues creating one-of-a-kind New Year’s Eve events with unusual themes, live music or special performers.”</p> <p>People sometimes opted for more than one venue, such as having a dinner out and a trip to the pub, Bent added, and plans were often made last-minute. “Celebrating the last day of the calendar year has always had a last-minute nature to it – last year, just under half (46%) of tickets to New Year’s Eve events on DesignMyNight were bought between Christmas Day and 31 December.”</p> <p>This year, demand for novel nights out appears to be on-trend. “It seems to be the quirkier the better, but this year there’s been a huge increase in ‘bottomless’ New Year’s Eve events, so those offering limitless drinks as part of the ticket price,” Bent said, which she said was great for those trying to control their spending, particularly in large groups.</p> <p>However you choose to celebrate, there was plenty of choice, Bent said. “Whether it’s a low-key restaurant booking or something more immersive like a secret pink party in a London mansion or even an Abba-themed night with live performers – there really is something for everyone on New Year’s Eve.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 2 January 2025. An earlier version said that there had been a 415% increase in tickets for club nights in 2024 compared with the previous year. In fact these figures specifically referred to events with bottomless drinks.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In 2003, Berlin had just woken up from a decade-long fever dream: the Wall had fallen, the city had reunited and the two German states had a common capital once again. Financially, Berlin’s awakening was a total hangover: billions in debt had piled up and unemployment had reached an all-time high. Culturally, however, the city was blooming. The arts and nightlife were bustling like a never-ending after-hours party on the leftovers of the cold war. This parallelism of decay and pleasure was described by the then mayor, Klaus Wowereit, in an interview that year as “<a href=\"https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/open-source/berlin-20-jahre-nach-klaus-wowereits-arm-aber-sexy-was-hat-die-hauptstadt-noch-zu-bieten-li.2167746\">poor but sexy</a>”.</p> <p>The phrase was so cheesy and so powerful, it became a slogan for Berlin’s image in subsequent years, drawing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/22/berlin-new-economy\">young creatives</a> from all over the world to the city’s promising subculture scenes and its relatively affordable housing. One of these young people was me. In 2012, when I had just graduated from university, I planned to stay in Berlin for the summer. Twelve years on, I am still here.</p> <p>What made me stay was a thriving cultural scene that allowed me, like many others, to understand art not just as a form of retreat from the world but a critical approach to it, a tool to understand life in new ways. Events like the <a href=\"https://taz.de/CTM-Festival-in-Berlin/!5987252/\">experimental music festival CTM</a>, avant-garde theatres like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/theater/rene-pollesch-volksbuehne.html\">Volksbühne</a>, the independent art spaces and literature houses, and indie cinemas such as Sinema Transtopia were not just built to sell likable entertainment, they were spaces of social gathering where we could imagine what world we wanted to live in. Where we could see works by artists from all over the world without having to buy overpriced tickets. But those times are over.</p> <p>Plans to cut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/plan-to-cut-berlin-arts-budget-will-destroy-citys-culture-directors-warn\">Berlin’s culture budget</a> by €130m for 2025 have sent shockwaves through the arts scene. Protests were staged in an effort to fend off the plans, but still, the cuts were agreed in the city senate’s last meeting before the holidays. From opera houses and galleries to cultural education programmes and freelance artists, so much of Berlin’s cultural infrastructure relies on state subsidies that many venues and individuals fear going bankrupt next year.</p> <p>Even Joe Chialo, the state minister for culture of the conservative Christian Democrat party (CDU) describes the 12% cuts as drastic and brutal, but at the same time encourages cultural institutions to think and act more like <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/joe-chialo-ueber-wettbewerb-und-eigenverantwortung-110133244.html\">businesses</a>. In short, from now on the market will decide what kind of art will survive and what won’t. I can already foresee a Berlin flooded by all the lazy work of rich kid artists who don’t have to make a living. And this is certainly the city’s glorious end as an <a href=\"https://www.theartist.me/culture/berlin-fascinating-city-for-art-lovers/#google_vignette\">inspiring place</a> to go.</p> <p>Because, let’s face it, Berlin is not a pretty place. The winters are a total nightmare, no sunlight, no warm face. Its cuisine is all about fast food. Large parts of town smell like a public toilet; overdosed tourists randomly pass out on the street. It’s not a city where you would sit out on a cafe terrace to people-watch. But also it’s now nearly impossible to find an <a href=\"https://www.the-berliner.com/politics/berlin-affordable-housing-apartment-shortage-crisis-construction-rent-real-estate/\">affordable flat</a> you could call home.</p> <p>Arts and culture are the only things that make Berlin exceptional. You will always see or hear something new and exciting, and you don’t have to be wealthy to do so. Culture was never an elitist project in Berlin. State subsidies helped to keep ticket prices low, which for Berlin’s current mayor seems to be unjust. In an act of rhetorical aerobics, its Christian Democrat mayor, Kai Wegner, asks, if it is fair that “a cashier at the supermarket, who probably goes to the state opera quite rarely, helps to subsidise opera tickets with the taxes she pays?”</p> <p>According to this logic, culture is a privilege reserved for the rich, who can afford high ticket prices. An opinion poll by the newspaper taz found out that cashiers are <a href=\"https://taz.de/Kuerzungen-im-Kulturetat-von-Berlin/!6054590/\">not amused</a> by Wegner’s remark, and would rather decide themselves if they belong at the opera house or not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/17/germany-election-olaf-scholz-democracy-europe\">Germany is in a sorry state – and all our leaders can do is yell at each other | Jörg Lau</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it’s not just about the opera. Free Sundays at Berlin museums will cease to exist, and cultural education programmes are being abolished. Cultural activities that focus on antidiscrimination, diversity, inclusion and migration are all heavily affected. It almost feels as if the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party is already in power, except it doesn’t even need to be, because the coalition of centrists in the city senate is taking care of the AfD’s priorities, namely <a href=\"https://taz.de/Berlin-spart-an-der-Kultur/!6048501&amp;s=sophie%2Bjung/\">defunding everything </a>that is critical of a nationalist and regressive understanding of culture.</p> <p>To get the bigger picture, consider the so-called <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundestag-antisemitismus-resolution-wissenschaft-documenta-lux.F15cGH8niLGEcyj4WiEFmS\">antisemitism resolution</a> the German parliament passed in November. For many scientists and artists, its vague wording demanding that public funding be denied to projects which “spread antisemitism”, raises serious questions about freedom of expression and could easily turn into a repressive tool against critics of the Israeli government.</p> <p>For decades, Berlin has profited from its image as a haven for artistic freedom. It has sucked the juice out of its artists to build the international prestige it has today. But instead of protecting its only trademark, the city is selling out its cultural workers to balance the budget.

            "body" : "<p>Good morning. If you’re planning to go out in a big city on New Year’s Eve, it is more likely than ever that your festivities will be sponsored, guarded, overpriced and restricted. In London, Edinburgh – although not this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/30/edinburgh-cancels-new-years-eve-hogmanay-street-parties-and-fireworks-due-to-storm-warning\">as Hogmanay celebrations have been cancelled</a> because of forecast storms – and many other cities in the UK and around the world, public squares that were once understood to be a shared space for anyone who cared to use them are now often under the control of private companies, contracted by the authorities to keep people safe, keep them spending money – and even keep them away.</p> <p>This change is predicated on the idea that an unmanaged crowd is a dangerous, mindless thing that can lead even the most upstanding citizen into some sort of barbarism. In his superb new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/multitudes-9781804294482/\">Multitudes: How Crowds Made The Modern World</a>, <em><strong>Dan Hancox</strong></em> argues that this isn’t true – and that, instead, being part of a free-roaming festive crowd is among the best things about being a human being.</p> <p>For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Dan about the fascinating, bleak changes to how new year crowds are allowed to assemble, and what those changes reveal about modern society. I hope you find an unbranded celebration that lets you roam wherever you want tonight, and here are the headlines.</p> <h2>In depth: ‘There is something instinctive about congregating with strangers when something exciting happens’</h2>    <p><strong>Thanks so much for doing this, Dan. One thing that might be a useful way to begin is by explaining the distinction you make in the book between “closed” and “open” crowds. What’s the difference? And which kind is a </strong><strong>New Year’s crowd?</strong></p> <p>A closed crowd is something like a concert hall or a football stadium – somewhere with secure perimeter fencing with paid-for tickets nearly always as a condition of entry, and with a bunch of other conditions of entry as well. You’re entering into, usually, a private space, and you’re paying for the privilege to do so, and your behaviour sort of responds accordingly. You’re more likely to sit still in the seat that has been assigned to you and to comport yourself according to the social norms of that particular space. </p> <p>Open crowds in the modern city are increasingly rare. And New Year’s Eve crowds are a very good example – a rare example – of a substantial urban open crowd in which there is theoretically no boundary, that people freely leave and join and move around in without any kind of authority. You get this at Notting Hill carnival [in west London]. You might get it when, say, the Lionesses win the Euros and people spontaneously gravitate towards the city centre to celebrate, but nobody has particularly summoned them there to do so. Most protests are open crowds too, even if they have stewards in yellow jackets, marshalling the edges. It’s about your freedom of movement to join and leave.</p> <p><strong>In recent years, as part of a wider change in the way people in cities are policed, </strong><strong>new </strong><strong>year celebrations have become more likely to be closed crowds with particular areas that you’re allowed to be in, and ticketing</strong><strong> and more heavy-handed security. What does that change about the experience</strong><strong>?</strong></p> <p>That is absolutely the trend of the last decade, to turn those open crowds into closed crowds, and New Year’s Eve is a prime example of that. In cities like London and New York and Sydney, you have what was hitherto an assembly of up to a million people, sprawled quite messily across the city in an attempt to join the throng, being quite heavily securitised.</p> <p>In London, it was Boris Johnson in 2014 who introduced ticketing for the fireworks for the first time. And with the ticketing, you get a cavalcade of other conditions – fencing, stewarding, security guards, closer surveillance, and now also stratified ticketing, where you can pay more for a “better” service. It has the effect of compartmentalising the crowd, because an open crowd is viewed as dangerous and suspicious by people in power. It’s a very clear hierarchy of wealth and class that revives the way cities were constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p> <p>The current mayor, Sadiq Khan, was critical of it at the time, saying that this was purportedly about safety but was really about monetising people’s good time – but then when he was elected, he kept it. Ticket prices start at £20 and go up to £50 for a better view. They’re already sold out for this year. There’s also a company <a href=\"https://thamesribexperience.com/new-years-eve-2024/\">offering new year packages</a> where you get a boat for 12 people to float down the Thames for £5,775. </p> <p>One of the big consequences of this, which I think is a real demerit, is that you just get many fewer people coming – in London, it’s down from a million to 100,000. The same thing is true in Sydney and in other places where the same thing has happened. It works quite consciously as a dispersal method, which should be antithetical to what they want, which is a thriving, buzzing city.</p> <p><strong>You quote </strong><strong>Elias Canetti</strong><strong>, who wrote a book called </strong><strong>Crowds and Power in 1960,</strong><strong> and says that what people want in a crowd is a “blessed moment, when no one is greater or better than another”. </strong></p> <p>I would say that it cuts against the spirit and the fun of joining the crowd. The new year’s crowd is essentially the carnival crowd, by which I don’t mean Notting Hill or Rio but this ancient spirit of carnival – the moment where the pauper is the king and vice versa, and everyone in the village is allowed to escape the bonds of the usual hierarchy in the name of a good party. If you’re being compartmentalised according to taste, wealth, mobility that goes against something innate in us.</p> <p>There’s this brilliant Finnish expression, <em>torilla tavataan</em>, which literally means “to the town square”, but is used figuratively as an expression of joy, say when your team has just won the ice hockey. It reveals something really important: the crowd belongs in the public square and the public square belongs to the crowd, and there is something instinctive about congregating with strangers when something exciting happens.</p>    <p><strong>A thread through a lot of what you’re talking about is the growth of the events industry.</strong> <strong>One of the most memorable examples of how they have changed things was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/26/edinburgh-residents-restrictions-hogmanay\">the story in 2019</a> about festival organisers Underbelly </strong><strong>making people in Edinburgh apply for access to their own homes if they lived within the “street party area”, and </strong><strong>restricting whether they could have their own New Year’s Eve parties. </strong></p> <p>That’s like a hyperbolic example of the kind of thing we see more generally – where a very heavily commercialised events industry traps something free and organic. There have always been events, and there have always been people organising them, and often monetising them. But the growth of the urban events industry in the past two decades is extremely striking, and it’s now a key part of the post-industrial city’s economic mix – both in attracting tourism, but also just encouraging people who live there to spend their disposable income.</p> <p>It’s also important to say that this isn’t just about the organisation – it’s also about how the city is constructed. Most cities in the west have more and more fences, metaphorically and literally, and there are more and more spaces that appear to be public and are actually owned by private developers. They’re known as privately owned public spaces, or POPs for short. And that has had a huge impact on how crowds behave and where they are able to assemble.</p> <p>But although it’s accelerated significantly, it’s also not a new phenomenon. Trafalgar Square is a great example: when it was first laid out in the early 19th century, the Chartists were on the rise, and there was real clamour and public protest about the extension of the electoral franchise. And because of the concern of the vast amount of space Trafalgar Square offered, after a year or so they added the vast fountains – they take up almost half the entire space, and the only reason they are so big is because it reduces the space available for the crowd by half. So the authorities have always been concerned about large crowds, and will try to mitigatethat by designing them out.</p> <p><strong>Is there any truth to the idea that</strong><strong> the only way to make a crowd safe is to make it smaller – or that you need this level of oversight to look after people?</strong></p> <p>It is a genuine and important concern – over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/29/dozens-of-people-crushed-by-large-crowd-at-halloween-festivities-in-south-korea\">150 people died in Seoul in South Korea</a> only a couple of years ago in a horrendous Halloween tragedy on very narrow streets. But the leading crowd safety experts say that all crowd crushes are avoidable with the right preparations. And I wonder if, with New Year’s Eve, safety is being used as a bit of an excuse.</p> <p>The best counter example is Notting Hill carnival, where about a million people a day throng, generally safely, in a tiny little web of streets where 40,000 people normally live. I spoke to the CEO of the carnival trust, Matthew Phillip, and he told me that the first thing he did when he took over was <em>remove </em>a lot of the barriers. That may sound counterintuitive, but the evidence is that the best way to ensure safety is to give them freedom of movement. Bottling people up just makes crushes more likely.</p> <p><strong>You cite </strong><strong>Barbara Ehrenreich</strong><strong>, who argued that in the 20th century “a truly participatory, popular, cultural and festive life was transformed into pure rock’n’roll spectacle”, and that </strong><strong>you could view that as the conclusion of a centuries-long effort to tame audiences. Do you see the </strong><strong>new </strong><strong>year crowd as an extension of that phenomenon?</strong></p> <p>The trend of the past 50 years is of the capture and containment of public festivities. They are just too unruly to make enough money from to be allowed to continue. But that attempt to bring the festive crowd to heel should be pushed back against. Yes, what’s happened in cities like London has made the crowd smaller, perhaps made it better behaved, but also made it less free. That’s a shame, because we have an evolutionary imperative to get together with strangers for a good time, and it’s what we should all be doing on New Year’s Eve, whether or not we can afford a ticket.</p> <p><em>Reading this online or on the Guardian app?

            "body" : "<p>I am thrilled that in the new year honours list I am being made an MBE. I know some people disapprove of the honours system and others will be outraged that I am accepting an award in the name of the British empire. But I welcome the opportunities I’m hoping the award will bring.</p> <p>I am being honoured as a writer and broadcaster for services to LGBTQ+ culture, but when I was growing up in the 1980s there was hardly any queer culture, and what we had was pretty much underground and undiscussed. When gay men did feature in the media we were demonised as dangerous, Aids-carrying sexual predators who couldn’t be trusted around children. At school I suffered terrible homophobic bullying, and when the Tory government introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/27/section-28-protesters-30-years-on-we-were-arrested-and-put-in-a-cell-up-by-big-ben\">section 28</a>, any teachers who may have wanted to defend me weren’t legally allowed. So when a letter arrived from the Cabinet Office, telling me I was being recommended by the prime minister to the king for an MBE, I was so proud I burst into tears.</p> <p>It comes after decades of hard work and fighting. Yes, I have had positive reactions to the journalism I’ve written about gay issues such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/22/sex-without-fear-my-experiment-with-hiv-preventative-drug-prep\">HIV prevention drug PrEP</a>, or my undercover mission to report on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/03/homophobia-feeds-russia-hiv-epidemic\">homophobia in Russia</a>. But when I first appeared as the culture editor of Channel 4 News in 2010, some of the responses I experienced were savage. X users commented that I was “ridiculously camp” or “double gay, even … he kills my ears”, and in the Sunday Times, the critic AA Gill compared me to another famously effeminate man, declaring I was “to arts reporting what Wayne Sleep was to darts”.</p> <p>When I started writing novels, it took me more than 10 years to get published. A few editors singled out the gay content of my first novel as problematic, one of them finding it “a bit too explicit for comfort”. Another had a problem with the story being told from a gay character’s point of view as this “pushes the novel into that niche market for me”. Another editor commented that “this type of book really needs to fall into the literary fiction arena, think of Edmund White, of Alan Hollighurst [sic]” – the implication being that straight readers who were intelligent and educated could empathise with gay characters, but the readers of more accessible fiction couldn’t. I eventually had to turn to crowdfunding publisher Unbound to raise the core costs of releasing The Madonna of Bolton. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/06/novel-rejected-gay-crowdfunding-support-the-madonna-of-bolton-by-matt-cain\">broke the record</a> for crowdfunding a novel in just seven days.</p> <p>Since then I have had several books published but still had to battle homophobia. Even my biggest selling novel, The Secret Life of Albert Entwistle, was turned down by several publishers, one of whom suggested I only reveal my central character’s sexuality “towards the end” – quite something considering the story is about a closeted gay man searching for the long lost love of his life. The same editor also commented that she didn’t want me to be “so explicit on the wider LGTB [sic] issues”.</p> <p>Online I have recently received comments calling me a “certified freak”, an “abomination to the Lord your God” and a “child groomer”. But homophobia isn’t always so explicit. Within the publishing industry, I still have to battle the idea that gay themes need sanitising for straight female readers, that they want a “wholesome”, neutered version of the queer experience. But I believe they want the authentic experience, however edgy this may be. I see my straight female readers as the girls who stuck up for me in the school playground, the strong women who feel a kinship with gay men because they too have been disrespected for their sexuality.</p> <p>That is why I think this honour sends out a powerful message and it is important I accept it. I’m hoping it may mean my work and that of other gay authors gets more recognition at major literary festivals, or that I’ll see more such books stocked in decent quantities by the upmarket retailers. I’m also hoping it means younger queer writers won’t have such a hard time breaking through. An MBE carries serious heft, heft that can only be useful for gay writers like myself, disrespected as camp and lightweight.</p> <p>But none of this will happen if the honours system continues to be brought into question by politicians such as Boris Johnson, who has been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/17/boris-johnson-criticised-bringing-honours-system-into-question-lords\">handing out awards</a> to aides and siblings. This makes me angry as it undermines the honours’ power, the increased platform they can give to people like me to continue pushing for change.</p> <p>And yes, I’m aware that the British empire exported many of the homophobic laws that still exist in a majority of Commonwealth countries. But I believe accepting honours opens up an opportunity – and responsibility – to educate more people about the mistakes and outrages of the past. And it is a platform to call for the UK government to do more to combat homophobic legislation by working with local activist groups on the ground, and offering them funding and expertise so they can campaign for legislative change.</p> <p>But all that is in the future. For now, I have dried my tears and am feeling happy, validated and appreciated. And tonight I will be celebrating with the campest drink I can find.</p> <ul> <li><p>Matt Cain is the author of novel One Love, published by Headline.

There’s an embarrassment of sequins and pink, blue and ice-blond hair; vivid eye shadow that stretches extravagantly up to the brow; carnival looks and Catholic looks. On the cover of the book there is a shot from the waist down of someone wearing lamé gold leggings. Smith plans to wear something similar to the book launch. “It was like every night was Halloween,” says Smith, remembering two girls wearing hazmat suits.</p>    <p>Smith’s photos are a document of a different era, and could be seen as a timely repost. As Honey Dijon notes in the book: “Today, to get past the red rope you just have to pay, but back then you had to have a look or a vibe or a witty repartee – there had to be something about you – to pass through that door.” For some that might sound like a lot of pressure. “A little bit,” says Smith, “but it also adds this element of fun,” something she thinks “is sorely missing in our culture”. It made going out “an event,” she says.</p> <p>It also sounds like a sartorial challenge for someone more used to dressing down. “For me, it was an education,” she says. “It took me a couple of months to figure out that I needed to be noticeable in some way, but not competitive with people.” Her “costume” – <em>her</em> word – evolved. “It ended up being a black strapless dress with fingerless black lace gloves and these high heels that I got from Barneys on sale, which I wore to death.”</p>    <p>Innocuous, relatively speaking, but also not nothing, Smith’s chosen look probably helped her to get the shots that she did. There’s one of Debbie Harry in a red and yellow stripey T-shirt with pink eyeshadow, and another of David Bowie delicately tucking his chin to give a profile shot. “I don’t remember a lot about that. But I did ask him and then he just gently turned his head. It wasn’t like he wanted to get away from me. It was like: ‘Oh, look at this.’” In the book she recounts her 3am encounter with Grace Jones. “When I walked up to her and raised my camera … she looked at me for a split second, slipped on her sunglasses, then smiled. The flash went off and she whispered, ‘Thanks, love,’ – then strode on to the dancefloor.”</p> <p>There is a lingering sadness to the pictures, too. A record of the life-affirming creative scene in a city bubbling with talent and energy, many of the photographs capture people who would go on to die during the Aids epidemic that would soon sweep the city. “A lot of these people are no longer with us. A lot of them,” says Smith.</p> <p>If the outfits in the clubs were an education to Smith, it sounds like they were also an education to people outside the scene. “People would buy a T-shirt in the basement of the Ritz about a band and they would rip it up. And then two weeks later people would be buying ripped up T-shirts from shops on Madison Avenue … The fashion that was going on there had legs.”</p>    <p>Smith was 28 when she walked into the Ritz and set out her stall selling quickfire portraits to partygoers for $3 a pop. Now 73 and a tai chi teacher, she thinks some of the sartorial brilliance may have been a response to the repressive politics of the day. “It was the Reagan years. New York was kind of a gritty place, and you walked into the clubs and there was this celebratory feeling and people were dressed up.”</p> <p>She thinks the individuality on display then isn’t happening now. But, for better or worse, that might be about to change. “It’s not a reason to go through this horrible [time],” but if any good does come of it, she hopes “there’s another explosion of creativity”.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.ideanow.online/store/Camera-Girl-p711579974\">Camera Girl by Sharon Smith is out now, published by Idea</a></em></p>",

I drag them behind me, head down like a shire horse, and the sharp twigs leave little furrows in the muddy grass behind me.</p> <p>For more than two decades, it has been an annual ritual to have a Hogmanay fire on my parents’ smallholding in the Borders. First as students, then dependant-free 20-year-olds, and now parents entering middle age, my brother and I have stood in the same squashy field beneath the same silhouetted stand of alder trees. We take stock of the year with cold&nbsp;backs and flame-seared faces, as our wellies sink into the ooze, and our conversation is interrupted by interjections from the local tawny owl population.</p>    <p>What we burn is different each year. The branches, brash and assorted hedge clippings are their own record of the year, an off-fall that we purge to make way for the following season. (Most of the garden waste is either composted, shredded into mulch, or used to build dead hedges.)</p> <p>We often cook on the fire. One year we attempted to pit-roast two haunches of venison for a party of 18 people. As we laid the meat on a bed of coals entombed in cold mud, it seemed impossible – ludicrous – that it would cook. So we added some extra time. But cook it did, all too well – when we peeled back the tinfoil 20 hours later, we revealed several kilos of ash.</p> <p>This year we’re cooking lamb on the coals above ground, where we can keep an eye on it, and we’re mostly burning crab apple (<em>Malus&nbsp;sylvestris</em>). The biggest storm of January 2024 brought down half a tree that had grown in a lopsided fashion, and became snared by a heavy tangle of clematis. Chain-sawing up the fallen limb was my second encounter with the spiky, jagging properties of crab apple. As a nine-year-old I crashed into a nearby tree&nbsp;on a sledge, an accident that left a pale, sickle-shaped scar beneath my left nostril.</p> <p>Now it’s almost time to burn it. I run my finger along the old wound, an action that is both automatic and reassuring, before hauling the last limb to where the bonfire will be.</p> <p>• Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 15% discount</p>",

            "body" : "<p>There was a time when, in order to acquire a new item of clothing – say, a dress – you had to either inherit it from a family member or trek to a store and have an identity crisis in the changing room. Now, you can buy one in under two minutes from your couch.</p> <p>Online shopping should have made my life easier. Being able to purchase from home or on my commute should have freed up my time and energy. It should have also made me a more ethical, conscious consumer. No need to load up on plasticky tops from Forever 21 – I could use my phone to shop secondhand or from sustainable brands. Instead, the siren song of cute clothes consumed my brain and lured me on to the rocks of infinite scrolling, consumerism and credit card debt.</p> <p>I used to love scrolling through pages of models who looked nothing like me, wearing pieces I could never afford or pull off. This sartorial fantasising was a way to kill time and to escape. Waiting for a friend at a restaurant? Time to hunt for wide-leg jeans. Tough day at work? Pull up the RealReal and search for a blazer that would make me appear competent. Bad date? Buy a skirt for a good one.</p> <p>It was an expensive, time-consuming coping mechanism. I spent money I didn’t have and, although sometimes the clothes were great, often they weren’t quite right. Even if they didn’t fit, or I hated them, I never returned them because the whole process felt too daunting. Printing a return label? Going all the way to the post office? I have but one wild and precious life to live! And besides, what if in the next couple of years my body and personality completely changed and these clothes became perfect for me?</p> <p>It gave me the nagging sense that I was one purchase away from becoming the person I was supposed to be. Surely, once I found the exact right sweater dress or pair of boots, everything would fall into place. The hunt for myself was constant – and exhausting.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My carbon footprint is still bigger than I’d care to admit. For the most part, though, I’ve kept to my word</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then, a few years ago, out of financial necessity and after a particularly grim cull of my closet before a cross-country move (donating<strong> </strong>that many one-shoulder tops really makes you confront yourself and your choices), I decided to stop. From now on, I would shop only in person and I would only buy clothes I really, truly loved on me – as they were, and as I was.</p> <p>Almost immediately, I found myself with a lot more free time and mental energy. Shopping for clothes in person took more effort, but it was a contained activity. I wasn’t spending hours trying to imagine what I might wear if I were someone completely different. I wasn’t constantly taking stock of what I lacked. Over time, I felt better about myself. I also saved money.</p> <p>I have not been perfect, and my carbon footprint is still bigger than I’d care to admit. Just the other week, I got an email about a criminally good sale on cardigans, so I bought two, because it seemed financially irresponsible not to. When they arrived, they fitted weirdly, and I realised they must have been on sale for a reason.</p> <p>For the most part, though, I’ve kept to my word. When I start to feel the urge to spend two hours shopping for midi skirts on my phone, I try to figure out what is behind that impulse: sometimes I’m bored; sometimes I’m feeling insecure. Most of the time, this insight is enough to douse the burning urge to scroll.</p> <p>And if it’s not, I trek to a store and have an identity crisis in the changing room. As nature intended.</p>",

The public, faced with daily predictions of potentially terrible outcomes, braced themselves nervously.</p> <p>Dark jokes prevailed about avoiding being on “a life-support system at midnight on 31 December 1999”. In China, Zhao Be, then the head of the country’s millennium bug coordination efforts, commanded airline executives to be on a flight on 1 January 2000 to demonstrate any problems had been sorted.</p> <p>Yet, in the end, nobody appeared to perish.</p> <p>The same might be said of one of the earliest events to reveal the existence of the bug, which was also known as Y2K.</p> <p>In 1987 Marks &amp; Spencer received a batch of tinned meat that was rejected because the <a href=\"https://nationalpreparednesscommission.uk/publications/lessons-from-the-millennium-bug/\">company’s computers thought it was almost 90 years past its January 2000 use-by date</a>. Five years later, a Minnesota kindergarten invited one <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m1EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Mary+Bandar+of+Winona,+US&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cKSW7sfqfj&amp;sig=ACfU3U2RZy7ALN6Faaevd4tqXJEx4gcgfA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKjfei08nmAhUJE8AKHVCjD0IQ6AEwDHoECBwQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Mary%20Bandar%20of%20Winona%2C%20US&amp;f=false\">Mary Bandar</a> to join its classes. She was 104 at the time.</p> <p>These quirky errors were the result of early computer scientists solving a practical problem. To save space and speed up processing, computer dates were abbreviated. So January 1900 was 01/00 and December 1999 was 12/99. Trailblazing computer scientists had assumed that none of the computers would be in use by 1999. Only, it turned out there were so many legacy systems in operation that catastrophic results appeared a certainty to some.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/28/all-people-could-do-was-hope-the-nerds-would-fix-it-the-global-panic-over-the-millennium-bug-25-years-on\">‘All people could do was hope the nerds would fix it’: the global panic over the millennium bug, 25 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One British family – the Perrons – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/05/y2k.uknews\">abandoned their Wiltshire home in 1998</a> and headed to a hillside cottage near Forres, Moray, as they feared food shortages, the accidental discharge of nuclear weapons, the breakdown of global capitalism and rioting on the streets. Their new property had no running water or electricity but did possess its own generator, while water was available from a nearby stream and the family grew vegetables in their garden and ate eggs provided by their hens.</p> <p>This level of preparedness would have given them full marks from Action 2000, a UK government taskforce created during the period to monitor computer readiness. With a budget of £17m, it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/12/marktran\">name and shame</a> government departments and councils it judged were not ready – and the clamour to throw money at the problem grew and grew. The research firm Gartner estimated the total global cost of millennium bug remediation to be as high as $600bn (£475bn).</p> <p>Yet, despite all of the effort and cost, issues still occurred.</p> <p>Internationally, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/03/07/big-glitch-at-nuclear-plant-shows-perils-of-y2k-tests/a148232f-5760-403c-bc14-b00382b6852d/\">15 nuclear reactors shut down</a>; there were power cuts in Hawaii; and the bug was blamed for more than <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1541557.stm\">150 pregnant women being given incorrect results of a Down’s syndrome test</a>.</p> <p>But the enduring story was how few problems actually occurred. The Perrons’ stash of stockpiled medicines remained untouched and life continued much as it had done before – prompting criticisms that the risks had been overstated. Some even threatened legal action as they suggested technology companies had exaggerated the likely effects of the bug – while communist Cuba dismissed the warnings as a capitalist conspiracy to boost spending on computers. These allegations were met with fury by the industry.</p> <p>As Martyn Thomas, who led Deloitte Consulting’sY2K work internationally in the mid-1990s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/millennium-bug-face-fears-y2k-it-systems\">argued in the Guardian in 2019</a>: “The millennium bug was real and the internationally coordinated effort was a great success. Tens of thousands of failures were prevented. Some suppliers took advantage and sold unnecessary upgrades to their customers, but those of us who worked days, nights and weekends to meet the hard deadline of December 1999 are angered when ignorant people think that because we succeeded, the threat was not serious.”</p> <p>Still, countries such as <a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/Y2K-bug/\">Italy, Russia and South Korea</a> were said to have done little to prepare for Y2K, and yet appeared to experience no more technological problems than countries writing huge cheques. US spending was about double that of Italy’s, according to a <a href=\"https://www.regulation.org.uk/library/2017-y2k_bug_evaluation.pdf\">weighted Y2K Spending Index</a> compiled by the market intelligence group, International Data Corporation (IDC).</p> <p>In the aftermath, Margaret Beckett, who led the UK government’s Y2K work, said: “It is not true that some of international partners ‘spent next to nothing’. We know from our many contacts in the International Year 2000 Co-operation Centre that a huge amount of work was done across the world, including Russia, Asia, Latin America and Africa.”</p> <p>Or, as the trade publication <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Was-Y2K-a-costly-non-event\">Computer Weekly put it</a> on 13 January 2000: “Two weeks into the new year, and the millennium bug is beginning to look like one of the greatest non-events in history. After dire predictions of global recession, nuclear meltdowns, and food shortages, 1 January was a serious anticlimax.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Doing Glastonbury sober is a challenge most music-festival fans would decline.</p> <p>But it was just that experience that inspired Trevor O’Shea to launch his first dry pub in a chain of entertainment outlets in Dublin last January.</p> <p>Taken aback by the lack of options for non-drinkers, he set himself an ambitious task in a country renowned for its drinking culture.</p> <p>“I went to Glastonbury last year and I wasn’t drinking at the time and the options at Glastonbury were shocking,” he says. “All you could get was Erdinger non-alcoholic beer, Red Bull, Coca-Cola, coffee and maybe juices. It was fine on day one, but on day four you’re done with it.</p> <p>“So I was flying home and I was thinking of changing that bar at the time and I thought I love a challenge and there’s no bigger challenge to have a no-alcohol bar,” said O’Shea whose runs the Bodytonicmusic company.</p> <p>Thus Board (styled as B0%ard), on Clanbrassil Street, was born, offering a vast array of non-alcoholic options ranging from a draught selection of Estrella, Heineken and Guinness 0.0, the bar’s bestseller, to zero-alcohol spirits including gins and vodkas, mocktails, alcohol-free wines and a range of IPA with suitably unconventional names such as Weird Weather and Drink in the Sun.</p>    <p>“What we have noticed with Board’s was that the market was far more diverse than just people who might have had alcohol problems,” says O’Shea. “There is a cultural shift. Young people don’t really drink a huge amount.</p> <p>“They socialise on apps, they go on Tinder and meet people for coffee and don’t go out in groups in pubs like we used to,” says the 45-year-old. So designing a venue that combined the atmosphere of the pub with drinking options including dozens of non-alcohol drinks, pizza and games seemed the next thing for O’Shea.</p> <p>A report from Drinks Ireland this year found that sales of non-alcohol beer rose by 18% in 2023. It also found that per capita drinking in Ireland was now lower than the UK and Germany. Sales of draught Guinness 0.0 in Ireland alone have grown 50% in 2023.</p>    <p>A second report by the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland found alcohol consumption in the country is down by almost one-third over the past two decades.</p> <p>Almost a year in, O’Shea has now reintroduced alcoholic options, and he thinks the future of the non-alcohol sector lies in those bars leaning into the non-alcoholic market but not eschewing alcohol altogether.</p> <p>“Is the future non-alcoholic bars, or is it a bar with a really good non-alcoholic drinks menu,” he ponders citing the arrival of vegan options on mainstream menus killing the market for pioneering vegan restaurants.</p>    <p>Sam Tiernan, 25, who stopped drinking 22 months ago, is one of his regular customers and has been going to Board for the past eight months for chess nights on Mondays.</p> <p>Supping a hot chocolate while waiting for an opponent to become free, Sam says he likes Board because he is “less interested in going to places where the sole purpose is alcohol”. He can turn up on his own, meet people and have fun.</p> <p>Across the road in a traditional boozer, Ken Jenkins, 62, who grew up in the area, remembers Board in its previous guises as The Glimmerman and Francis McKenna’s.</p> <p>“I think it’s great because kids growing up now don’t want to drink. Their lifestyle is different, they are more into their gym and driving their cars,” he says. “The culture has changed from my generation when people would go out to get slaughtered. Those days are over. Thank God.” </p> <p>Upstairs, Mikhail Lagura, 27, is biding his time, waiting for another chess player to arrive. It’s his second time in the pub and he’s supping tap water.</p> <p>“I wanted to see what it was like to socialise in a place where you can fun without drinking alcohol,” he said. “Yes, we go to the gym, but you wouldn’t invite your mates for a night out there.”</p>    <p>Another solo drop-in is Matei Garcia, 40, a Spaniard who works in banking and has made the seven-mile journey across town from a business park.</p> <p>“I’ve been here about 10 times,” he says, drinking his matcha latte. “I really enjoy this. I would say I’m mediocre at chess but you learn from people. The Go community also come here.” </p> <p>Their experience chimes with two Irish entrepreneurs who run trampoline parks and are now set to launch a “competitive socialising” venue for adults at a Dublin racecourse, which will offer a night out centring on games such as shuffleboard, mini-golf and memory-based tech games.</p> <p>“The days of people going into a bar and drinking 10 to 15 pints is a thing of the past; they want more of an experience,” Dan Begley told the Business Post this month.</p>",

Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department led the pack, beating Oasis’s first album, Definitely Maybe, amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-tickets-dynamic-pricing-live-music\">excitement around the band’s reunion</a>.</p> <p>CD sales have been in steep decline in recent years but were down by just 300,000 to 10.5m, led by Coldplay’s Moon Music. Factoring in 182,000 sales in other formats such as cassettes, sales of recorded music in physical form rose by 1.4m to 17.4m, the first increase in two decades.</p> <p>Streaming continued to dominate, up 11m to 178m units of what the BPI calls “album-equivalent sales”, taking the overall market to 200.5m, a rise of nearly 9.7%.</p> <p>Despite the apparent health of the UK music scene, the BPI warned of the significant threat to artists posed by AI.</p> <p>Jo Twist, the BPI chief executive, said the UK’s “creative output and human creativity is being placed at risk by proposed changes to British copyright law which would allow international tech giants to train AI models on artists’ work without payment or permission”.</p> <p>Bodies representing creative people from the worlds of music, literature, film and photography have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/19/uk-arts-and-media-reject-plan-to-let-ai-firms-use-copyrighted-material#:~:text=UK%20arts%20and%20media%20reject%20plan%20to%20let%20AI%20firms%20use%20copyrighted%20material,-Exclusive%3A%20Coalition%20of&amp;text=Writers%2C%20publishers%2C%20musicians%2C%20photographers,intelligence%20companies%20train%20their%20algorithms.\">condemned the plans</a> to provide a copyright exemption to allow for AI training.</p> <p>Twist said Labour’s proposals “would be the wrong way to realise the exciting potential of AI”.</p> <p>“By meeting the growing global challenge head-on, tackling challenges around AI, copyright and streaming fraud, and encouraging consumers towards viable models, like paid streaming subscriptions, we can help to ensure that the value of British music is protected and that our industry can continue to grow and flourish at home and around the world,” she said.</p> <p>“The UK remains a world music power, but this status cannot be taken for granted: we need a supportive policy environment that puts the focus on human artistry and enables continued investment in the next generation of British talent.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Affordable new electric family cars – particularly those that are EU-made – have been tough to come by in Europe for the past few years. There were no launches of homegrown electric models for less than €25,000 (£20,740) across the EU during 2022 and 2023, according to the campaign group Transport &amp; Environment.</p> <p>Yet in the past few months that has changed, with a rush of new cars ranging from the Fiat Grande Panda to the Citroën ë-C3, the Hyundai Inster to the latest Dacia Spring and the Renault 5. Suddenly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/10/the-10-best-electric-cars-to-buy-if-you-want-to-avoid-tesla\">buyers have options</a>.</p> <p>That is no coincidence. Stricter EU carbon emissions targets kick in on 1 January, meaning carmakers will have to sell more electric cars or face fines. New battle lines are being drawn: the industry wants the rules relaxed, while environmental campaigners are urging the EU to hold firm.</p> <p>Carmakers around the world are struggling with faltering demand for their models, whether powered by batteries or internal combustion engines. Falling profits have come at a difficult time for the industry, just as it tries to find the money for the expensive transition to electric vehicles (EVs).</p> <p>Globally, 2024 has been a record year for electric car sales, driven by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/03/chinas-share-of-global-electric-car-market-rises-to-76\">extraordinary growth of China’s industry</a>. But the market in Europe has gone through a painful slowdown. Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric car analyst, forecasts a 1.4% fall in sales across the 18 largest western and northern European markets in the past year (including those in the UK and Norway).</p> <p>A key factor in the decline has been the withdrawal of generous subsidies for new electric cars in Germany, the continent’s biggest market for EVs. Will Roberts, the head of automotive research at the consultancy Rho Motion, said the end of incentives of €5,000 for each car was “quite a difficult thing to get over” for consumers in the EU’s largest car market, and that turmoil in German politics meant there had “not been any political motivation or societal motivation to turn that around”. France also had a slowdown in EV sales, possibly not helped by the country’s own political uncertainty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/ruEmX/1/\" data-alt=\"Electric car sales chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/ruEmX/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Schmidt said some carmakers were performing better than others. Ford is struggling to sell electric models made in Cologne, but BMW and Stellantis have previously said the emissions targets are not a problem. The electric-only brands Tesla and Polestar, plus fast-transitioning Volvo, are already far ahead of the targets – meaning they can sell “credits” to rivals.</p> <p>But the timing of the overall decline in sales has alarmed politicians, as car companies have blamed regulation for their plans to close factories. Volkswagen sent shock waves through Germany with a plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/28/volkswagen-shut-three-factories-cut-thousands-jobs-union\">close as many as three factories</a> in its home country – the first time it had considered a closure – before agreeing a deal before Christmas with trade unions to avoid compulsory redundancies. Ford is cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe, while Stellantis has repeatedly halted assembly operations at its main plant in Mirafiori, Italy, as well as announcing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/26/vauxhall-owner-plans-to-shut-luton-van-factory-putting-1100-jobs-at-risk\">closure of a van plant in Luton</a>, in the UK.</p> <p>In Britain, manufacturers have successfully argued they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/24/uk-car-industry-prius-style-hybrids-sale-zev-petrol-diesel-electric\">need leeway from fines</a>. The industry wants the same across the Channel. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea), an influential lobby group, has called for a “clear political statement by the European Commission by the end of 2024” that pledges to relax the emissions rules in order to save jobs.</p>    <p>There are signs that Europe’s policymakers may be amenable. The commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, is scheduled to start a “strategic dialogue” on the European car industry in January. The rightwing government, of Giorgia Meloni in Italy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/19/car-industry-calls-for-shift-in-eu-emissions-targets-amid-slowing-ev-sales\">leading the charge</a> to relax the emissions rules. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/20/eu-carmakers-emissions-fines-olaf-scholz-germany-vw\">signalled willingness to ease the fines</a>, although he is running for re-election in February after the collapse of his three-way coalition.</p> <p>Acea’s director general, Sigrid de Vries, called for the EU to recognise that the rules risk “stalling the transition, rather than nursing it” and are doing damage to European industry. “Nobody expected us to be in such dire straits when it comes to the transition now,. We’re in a very different world in many ways,” she said.</p> <p>Acea is hoping for changes such as allowing manufacturers to make up for missed targets with higher electric sales in later years. Another option is a phase-in period that would in effect allow manufacturers to fall short of their targets in the first year. </p> <p>Luca De Meo, the chief executive of Renault and Acea’s president, recently said the industry risked losing up to €16bn in “investment capacity” if things were left unchanged. The top risk he cited was fines. Carmakers will pay €95 for every gram by which average carbon dioxide emissions rise above a target 93.6g for each kilometre.</p> <p>However, the €16bn figure is disputed. Lucien Mathieu, T&amp;E’s cars director, said it was based on 2024 sales, ahead of new models. It was “like judging an athlete’s performance based on their practice session the year before”, he said.</p> <p>De Vries acknowledged that €16bn was an “envelope” figure that illustrated the size of the change that needed to “somehow be digested”, rather than an actual forecast.</p>    <h2>New cars, just in time</h2> <p>Whatever the actual cost, one part of the calculation is the cost of steep discounts to the industry. While carmaker profits fall, it also benefits another important group, consumers, who pay less for the cars they rely on.</p> <p>Five years ago this newspaper reported that 2020 was set to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/25/2020-set-to-be-year-of-the-electric-car-say-industry-analysts\">year the electric car</a> would go mainstream, as the first stage of the five-yearly EU rules kicked in. The number of electric models launched in 2020 duly doubled that year to 19, according to the data company Marklines, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/19/global-sales-of-electric-cars-accelerate-fast-in-2020-despite-covid-pandemic\">sales surged</a>. Something similar has happened this time: after 26 EV models were launched in 2023, there were 45 over the course of 2024 and at least another 35 are already scheduled to go on sale next year.</p> <p>Roberts said it was credible to think that carmakers had held back models. “Selling a BEV [battery electric vehicle]<strong> </strong>for VW in December is basically worthless for them,” he said. “If you can delay selling that EV to 2025” then it helps to avoid fines, Roberts said.</p> <p>Mathieu agreed. “Carmakers are holding back from launching more affordable models until next year. Why sell EV models this year when you need them next year?” he asked.</p> <p>For that reason, most analysts expect that sales of electric cars will rise sharply in 2025 across Europe – leaving 2024 as a minor blip before the transition accelerates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/1ZJpz/1/\" data-alt=\"Electric car sales chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/1ZJpz/1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But some analysts and campaigners are concerned that the lobbying for relaxed rules could harm Europe’s industry in the long term. Every time Europe’s carmakers stumble, China’s ranks of EV startups, led by BYD, take another step forward. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/12/eu-import-tariffs-chinese-evs-electric-vehicles-trade-war\">EU tariffs on Chinese cars</a> ranging from 21% to 38.1% are not thought likely to stop the companies from winning customers across Europe.</p> <p>“Weakening the targets will definitely not help the industry as they will fall further behind the Chinese,” said Mathieu. It would be “rolling out the red carpet for the Chinese manufacturers”.</p> <p>• This article was amended and updated on 2 January 2025 to include the information that VW agreed a deal with trade unions shortly before Christmas to avoid compulsory redundancies. </p>",

If someone asks how many are there of something, I need to know. I went out and counted how many there were, basically.”</p> <p>He soon realised the interesting thing about the project was not the bald numbers, but the tales behind the statues and what they may tell us about society more widely.</p> <p>“There are so many crazy stories behind them, there are so many interesting people who have come together to put them up,” Stride said.</p> <p>Academically, almost nothing had been written about the subject, which Stride has corrected with zeal.</p> <p>He said that since the 1990s statues had been recognised as an effective marketing tool for sports clubs, a phenomenon that began in the US and spread.</p> <p>The reasons are mixed but “essentially, it has been shown that fans get more attached to a club if they feel nostalgic about it”.</p> <p>They also help give new stadiums, which might look more like warehouses from the outside, some kind of identity which is why, outside Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, people will find statues of Tony Adams, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Ken Friar and Herbert Chapman, who was <a href=\"https://www.arsenal.com/arsenal-history/arsenal-s-heritage/arsenal-statues\">Arsenal manager between 1925 and 1934, winning the league four times in five years</a>.</p>    <p>Stride said it was interesting that sports statues do not tend to be in the centres of big cities but in smaller places that have often lost traditional industries.</p> <p>“It is the idea of trying to put some identity back into that town. Public art has always been used to try to do that, it’s just that between the 1920s and 80s public art tended to be a bit more arty, more abstract. Surveys showed that the public aren’t really into abstract art.”</p> <p>There was a swing back to figurative art but no appetite for the old figurative art subjects of military heroes or kings and queens, Stride said.</p> <p>It’s a reason places such as Ashington (Jack Charlton) and Barrow (Emlyn Hughes, Willie Horne) have sporting statues. “They’re often towns that have lost their key industries and they are clinging to something which will give them some identity.”</p> <p>Sporting statues are also fascinating for how many get it so wrong.</p> <p>A recent statue of Harry Kane in Walthamstow was <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2023-10-23/north-east-figures-pay-tribute-to-sir-bobby-charlton-after-his-death\">widely mocked</a>, joining a roll-call of misfires including a weirdly featured Ronaldo bust at Madeira airport that was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNNrhze3vs\">lampooned on Saturday Night Live</a> and a 12ft Maradona in Kolkata, India, which was said to look more like Bobby Ewing from Dallas, the football manager Roy Hodgson, or <a href=\"https://x.com/splbanter/status/940341837595897856\">“someone’s gran”</a>.</p>    <p>Stride said there was a straightforward reason why so many are bad. “It is a really difficult thing to do.</p> <p>“When I started the project I interviewed a lot of sculptors, maybe 20 or 30 of them, and one thing they collectively said is that sculpting a footballer is actually really difficult. It’s not like the Queen where you’ve only got the head right and then it’s a flowing dress.</p> <p>“With footballers you’ve got the legs, the shape of the body – fans will recognise the shape. The really difficult thing is to get a sense of movement into it.”</p>",

The greatly reduced timetables will mean north Wales, Blackpool and Edinburgh have no Avanti West Coast services on strike days.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Avanti will run one train an hour between London Euston and Birmingham, Manchester, and Preston, with a limited service to Glasgow. One train every other hour between Liverpool and Crewe will also run.</p> <p>On Thursday, the company will run one train an hour between Euston and Wolverhampton (via Birmingham), Crewe and Manchester. There will also be a limited service between Glasgow and Preston.</p> <p>These trains will operate during limited hours on both days, with the first train of the day leaving Euston at about 8am and the last train of the day from Euston departing before 5pm.</p> <p>Avanti said passengers who did want to travel should plan ahead, expect disruption, and check the details of their last train home.</p> <p>The strikes also coincide with engineering <a href=\"https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/travel-information/christmas/\">works and upgrades</a> on other busy lines, with some train companies also making changes to their timetables.</p> <p>Work is being undertaken at London Liverpool Street station until Wednesday. There is also work in the Cambridge area until 5 January and in the Crewe area until 2 January.</p> <p>Kathryn O’Brien, the executive director of customer experience at Avanti West Coast, said: “We’re disappointed by the RMT calling strike action on 31 December and 2 January. Our customers will face significantly disrupted journeys as a result, and I would like to thank them for their patience and understanding.</p> <p>“On the two strike days we’ll have a significantly reduced service, so customers with tickets for 31 December or 2 January are strongly advised to travel on alternative dates or claim a full fee-free refund. We remain open to working with the RMT to resolve the dispute.”</p> <p>The RMT union has said its members who work as train managers at Avanti West Coast will also be striking on Sundays between 12 January and 25 May.</p> <p>An RMT spokesperson said: “Our members have resoundingly rejected Avanti’s latest offers in two referendums, and sustained strike action is now the only way to focus management’s minds on reaching a negotiated settlement with the union.”</p> <p>Strikes planned for 22, 23 and 29 December were suspended after a suggested agreement was put to a referendum of RMT members.</p> <p>The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “Avanti West Coast created this dispute by ignoring train managers’ concerns and presenting offers those members deemed unacceptable. The company must come forward with a revised proposal so we can avoid more strike action further into 2025.”</p>",

Parents had to “relinquish the parenting of their own biological children and parent their co-habitants’ children instead”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The doctor assumed a “godlike status”, the court decision said, which gave him access to and control over two 12-year-old girls, who were daughters of his followers.</p> <p>He was found to have sexually abused both repeatedly over a period of months, including during a December 2021 trip to Bunnings to purchase supplies to help members of the sect paint a Melton home. On other occasions, the abuse occurred in hotel rooms and at a car park.</p> <p>He later told psychologists that he raped the girls to teach them how to “respect the lord” and said his desire was to “fix” his victims by showing them love, the court judgment said.</p> <p>Dissanayake said he did not derive any sexual satisfaction from the abuse, a claim the court of appeal described as both “delusional and chilling”.</p> <p>“The complainants were vulnerable young girls whose families were in the thrall of the respondent,” the court of appeal said. “He used his position and influence to facilitate access to the complainants and exert influence over them to commit the crimes. The offending was predatory offending of a disgusting and shameless kind.”</p> <p>Dissanayake was initially sentenced in the Victorian county court to eight years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years.</p> <p>Prosecutors appealed against the sentence, saying it was manifestly inadequate. They told the court of appeal that the offending was serious because of the 37-year age gap between the offender and his victims, the vulnerability of the girls, and the use of Dissanayake’s position as leader of the sect to facilitate access and exert influence over the girls.</p> <p>The court of appeal agreed, increasing the sentence to 10 years and 10 months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of eight years.</p> <p>“In this case, the respondent’s conduct has harmed two complainants and was particularly egregious given his role, not as a doctor, but as the leader of the sect to which the complainants’ parents belonged and over whom he exercised significant authority and control,” the court found.</p> <p>“Furthermore, the offending was planned and then concealed from other adults with lies. The respondent continued to be indifferent to the harm inflicted on the complainants until well after he was charged and, until at least April 2023, he was peddling the explanation that he had been doing the complainants some kind of favour.</p> <p>“He left his substantial expression of remorse to the day of sentencing.”</p> <p>The court rejected the notion that Dissanayake had been blinded by some kind of “religious ‘fog’” that clouded his ability to recognise the illegality of his actions.</p> <p>Dissanayake, the court said, was a “medical practitioner and an obviously intelligent and well educated man” who “well knew” he was engaging in criminal conduct.</p> <p>He initially migrated to Australia with his wife and two sons in 2006. He was an accredited doctor and only stopped working in April 2022 when he told the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency of the charges against him, prompting a suspension of his licence.</p> <p><strong>Do you know more?

I left school and ran away to go fishing, so now I don’t know what’s global warming, but the rains don’t come when it’s supposed to, the winds have changed,” James says.</p> <p>“Maybe we offended the sea gods, I don’t know, but now I have to move my family inland,” he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/08/png-cop29-papua-new-guinea-un-climate-summit\">‘A total waste of time’: why Papua New Guinea pulled out of Cop29 and why climate advocates are worried</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pariva beach is part of Kerema in Papua New Guinea’s Gulf province. In that area, rising sea levels and sand erosion have forced about 40,000 people to move inland over the past decade, a local councillor says, in what a leading climate change activist describes as a “humanitarian crisis”.</p> <p>The Kerema councillor Mai Trevor says 80,000 people lived in the local area, however, since 2015, almost half of the population has moved inland due to high tides and sand erosion. Trevor says residents first began moving in 2015, but over the last four years the number of people leaving has grown.</p> <p>As well as fishing, many in the province earn a living from coconut and betel nut farming. In recent years, residents say the tides have been rising and weather patterns have shifted, making it harder to grow crops or fish in the oceans, and affecting their livelihoods.</p> <p>“Many are moving to the mountaintops in Kerema town, while those who have land [further inland in nearby] Murua have moved there,” Trevor says.</p> <p>“We need a proper count of the population in the area to come up with a way to address it, all land are customarily owned so authorities can’t just relocate people,” she adds. Papua New Guinea is in the process of conducting its first census in many years, which experts say may reveal the population of the Pacific country to be far higher than current estimates of about 10 million people.</p> <p>The leading Papua New Guinea climate change activist Duncan Gabi also estimates tens of thousands of people have been displaced from the area around Pariva beach.</p> <p>“The sand erosion at Pariva beach [is] displacing 30,000 to 40,000 people, [it is] a humanitarian crisis that highlights PNG’s vulnerability to climate change,” Gabi says.</p> <p>He warns that a controversial proposal to begin sand mining in the western part of the Gulf province is fuelling fears the situation will get worse and argues authorities must act to help communities. </p>    <h2>‘Nothing is being done’</h2> <p>Kerry Anne Henry lives in a village of about 500 people near Pariva beach. She says people living in her village have begun to move inland due to the threat of rising seas and sand erosion.</p> <p>“Some people have land inland, on top of the mountains, and have started moving there,” she says.</p> <p>“Those who have no land elsewhere are just stranded at the coast, watching as the sand is slowly eroding and the tides come in. Our coconuts and betel nut are being washed away by the sea,” the 36-year-old says.</p> <p>“The authorities have turned a blind eye to the situation, and nothing is being done yet,” she says.</p> <p>A few kilometres away from Henry’s family home is Kerema airport. Tides now reach closer into the airport than they did in the past, and recently washed away the airport back fence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/embed-2024-12-31t144348-360-zip/giv-4559brB7QP5q8oap\" data-alt=\"map of PNG \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/12/embed-2024-12-31t144348-360-zip/giv-4559brB7QP5q8oap\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The environment, conservation and climate change minister, Simon Kilepa, says the rising sea levels and the impact on communities is a concerning issue that underscores the vulnerabilities faced by coastal communities across the country.</p> <p>Kilepa says the climate change and development authority (CCDA) is “working with various government departments and partners to best address the issue”.</p> <p>The CCDA acting managing director, Debra Sungi, says the agency is “deeply concerned about the challenges posed by rising sea levels”, which have already affected livelihoods, homes and the cultural heritage of thousands of Papua New Guineans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/24/low-lying-pacific-islands-sea-level-rise-un-meeting\">Low-lying Pacific islands pin hopes on UN meeting as sea rise threatens survival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She says the agency is working on “resilience-building measures to mitigate these impacts” and conducting vulnerability assessments in affected provinces, including the Gulf province, to make decisions on resources allocation. </p> <p>“We are committed to ensuring that no one is left behind as we navigate these unprecedented challenges,” she says.</p> <p>Still, Gabi says not enough is being done to support communities.

He has failed to report to investigators for questioning over allegations of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion, and his presidential security service has prevented court-ordered searches of his office and residence.</p> \n<p>Yoon also faces charges of insurrection – a crime that can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty and one of the few charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity.</p> \n<p>An official from the corruption investigation office said Yoon’s refusal to be questioned had prompted the warrant request.</p> \n<p>“The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime,” the official said.</p> \n<p>The warrant is valid until 6 January, he said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.</p> \n<p>Media reports said an imminent arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would seek to coordinate with the presidential security service. Technically, anyone obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant could be arrested.</p> \n<p>But under South Korean law, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it is unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces arrest.</p> \n<p>It is the first time an arrest warrant has been issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media.</p> \n<p>Police were deployed early on Tuesday outside Yoon’s residence in central Seoul in an attempt to prevent unrest. Yoon’s supporters and protesters calling for his removal have staked out his residence, with local media showing images of altercations between the two camps overnight.</p> \n<p>“Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?”<br><br>Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon’s residence to show they were doing their work diligently and fairly.</p> \n<p>Park Sung-min, president of the Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant was probably an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with the investigation.</p> \n<p>The acting leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president was inappropriate, according to Yonhap news agency.</p> \n<p>Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the national assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December over his imposition of martial law.</p> \n<p>The constitutional court has 180 days from that date to decide whether to confirm the impeachment or reinstate Yoon, whose two-and-a-half years in office have been marred by scandal and policy deadlock.</p> \n<p>The martial law order triggered weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to facilitate the investigation into his predecessor.</p> \n<p>Han’s successor as interim president, Choi Sang-mok, had been in office for just two days when he was confronted with the fatal plane crash at Muan international airport, the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday Choi called for national harmony and unity and for trust in the government in a New Year’s address. “The Republic of Korea is in an unprecedentedly serious situation,” Choi said in a written statement, citing changes around global trade, diplomacy and security, as well as domestic political uncertainty.</p> \n<p>“The government will do its best to run state affairs stably in all areas of defence, diplomacy, economy and society for the people to feel relieved,” he added.</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>",

Alexander Khinshtein, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said one person was injured in the latest attack in the region, where Ukrainian forces have seized a chunk of territory after launching an incursion in August. “Their purpose is to frighten people, sow confusion, panic and chaos,” Khinshtein said of the Ukrainian attack. “And to deny children the chance to enjoy the forthcoming New Year.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia and Ukraine have carried out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/30/russia-ukraine-swap-prisoners-exchange-deal\">major prisoner exchange</a>, with at least 150 people from each side returning home before New Year’s Eve,</strong> in a swap partly brokered by the United Arab Emirates. “The return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a message posted on Telegram on Monday. “My son is 5 years old now, the last time I saw him he was 2 years old,” said Serhii, who was captured by Russian forces at the Azovstal steel mill in the southern port Mariupol, which withstood a siege for nearly three months in 2022.</p></li> </ul>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine is pledging support for the new authorities in Syria, which was once a key Russian ally in the Mideast.</strong> Ukraine’s foreign minister met with Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus on Monday, days after Kyiv announced the delivery of a large shipment of wheat flour to the country after the ouster of Bashar al-Assad, who has been granted asylum in Moscow. Foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said he hopes “that a new Syria would become a country that respects international law”. “The Russian and Assad regimes supported each other because their foundation is violence and torture,” he added.</p></li> <li><p><strong>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to step up bilateral relations with Russia</strong> in a letter to President Vladimir Putin on Monday, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday. In the message, Kim sent New Year greetings to Putin and all Russians, including their troops and “wished that the New Year 2025 would be recorded as the first year of victory in the 21st century when the Russian army and people would defeat neo-nazism and achieve a great victory,” KCNA said. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence treaty at a summit in June, which calls for each side to come to the other’s aid in the event of an armed attack, and Pyongyang has since dispatched tens of thousands of troops to Russia to support its war effort, according to Ukraine, the US and South Korea.</p></li> </ul>",

That fleeting aspiration in high school, that you might travel the world, or make a difference: for most, sorry to say, the optimism was misplaced.</p> <p>So when a match of cricket delivers far beyond what fans could dream, it is worth celebrating. There can be no doubt that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/cricket-australia-india-fourth-test-day-five-report-scott-boland-nathan-lyon\">the Boxing Day Test was among sport’s finest moments</a>. The most culturally significant annual sporting event in Australia, bringing together two rivals, ebbing and flowing right down to the ultimate hour of the final day. A victory that will forever now be associated with captain Pat Cummins and his peers, a loss sure to motivate a new generation of Indian cricketers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/cricket-australia-india-fourth-test-day-five-report-scott-boland-nathan-lyon\">Australia gamble pays off as India collapse late in all-time classic Boxing Day Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just today The Guardian published a list of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/31/australia-biggest-best-sporting-moments-2024\">Australia’s 10 biggest sporting moments of 2024</a>. Although the calendar wouldn’t allow it, the article needed to wait another day. This five-day cricketing spectacular was at times funnier than Raygun. Fresher than Gout Gout. Tougher than the Blues. Slyer than a Fox. Certainly, more unpredictable than Angeball.</p> <p>So lasting is the match’s lustre, this is being written some 15 hours after the final wicket fell. And yet, still people will come to read, the headline and accompanying image igniting within Australians something irresistible. The world should have moved on. But this Test – in the minds of those who witnessed even just a ball – will long linger.</p> <p>There were many such minds. In total 373,691 attended the MCG across the five days, a number <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/boxing-day-test-record-cricket-crowd-australia\">“bigger than Bradman”</a>, or at least the best-attended Test during the era of Australia’s greatest proponent.</p> <p>These days Test cricket is in most countries played out in front of empty stadiums. The red ball remains a feature of the international calendar, for now, and the format of prestige for the game’s purists. But put simply, people don’t often come to watch it.</p>    <p>In that context, the turnout is absurd. The Boxing Day Test is traditionally the most popular Test in the Australian summer, but attracting even 200,000 has only been done five times in the past 40 years. This match exceeded the next highest tally – the 272,000 who came to watch the Ashes in 2013 – by more than 100,000.</p> <p>But there is extra significance in its status now as the highest-attended Test ever in Australia. No longer is this merely a British outpost where beating the Old Enemy is the most compelling motivation in sport. Now, a modern Australia has a New Frenemy.</p> <p>Much of the occasion – of the flags waving, the drums beating, the incessant noise – was thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/12/south-asia-cricket-australia-popularity-tape-ball-state-representative-level\">Australia’s blue-clad Indian diaspora</a>. This crowning glory of cricket was nothing without the infectious enthusiasm.</p> <p>This amplified five days of drama, of moments that each seemed decisive until they weren’t. When Yashasvi Jaiswal, perhaps the next great Indian batter after Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, had dulled the new ball and frustrated the home side in a wicketless second session on day five, the feats of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/26/sam-konstas-boxing-day-test-cricket-score-india-vs-australia-debut-performance\">debutant Sam Konstas</a> seemed like an age ago.</p> <p>The 19-year-old had failed in his second Test innings, but still had the gall to chirp at his majestic opponent relentlessly. It was unbecoming, a throwback to Australian cricket pre-Cummins captaincy, and utterly compelling.</p> <p>Konstas’ deadly naivety was just one of the character studies that enriched the five days. Like a glazed ham, Indian captain Rohit Sharma withered in the hours following Christmas, a legend surely now on the way out. The impetuous Kohli fighting Father Time who has set up camp outside his off stump.</p> <p>And the freshness of Jaiswal and his rags-to-runs story. Or Nitish Kumar Reddy and his father, who bowed at the feet of Sunil Gavaskar, a meeting with Indian royalty only made possible by his son’s first Test century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/boxing-day-test-record-cricket-crowd-australia\">Bigger than Bradman: bumper Boxing Day Test breaks record for cricket crowd in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The intimacy was matched by drama on the final day. Of Jaiswal’s silent thumb, of Nathan Lyon wheeling away then changing his mind, of Boland – always Scotty Boland. And never far away was Cummins, catalyst and conductor in a match that secures his legacy.</p> <p>The days quicken with AI daemons, pinging notifications and low-earth orbit satellites. The slow-moving humanity of this Test was like the glass of water you didn’t know you need. Over the holidays the aunts and uncles come and go, but Steve Smith is forever.

It is almost impossible to have a season where you do not have a moment like now for us.”</p> <p>Chelsea are fourth, 10 points off the leaders, Liverpool, but in the race for Champions League qualification. “Not one of us in this room expected us to be where we are now,” Maresca added. “This means and shows that we are in the right direction, as I’ve said many times, but also shows that we are far from competing [with] consistency and to be there with the best teams in England.”</p> <p>“I think we [have] to be satisfied with where we are but at the same time we need to know we [can] do things better,” the Italian concluded.</p> <p>Maresca did not challenge what looked a soft penalty for Delap’s opener when Filip Jörgensen brought down the striker, who scored from the spot to spark the end of Ipswich’s hunt for a first Premier League home win. “They said it’s a bit soft but we have to accept it’s a penalty,” he said with a shrug.</p>    <p>Both the Ipswich manager, Kieran McKenna, and Maresca – who coached Delap at Manchester City – were full of praise for the 21-year-old. He’s a different beast to the player he was in July,” said McKenna. “His rate of improvement for a young player is really high. His style is enjoyable to watch for anyone. There’s not many like him out there and he’s playing incredible Premier League defenders every week.”</p> <p>Delap and Hutchinson’s goals led to joyous celebrations at full-time at Portman Road, as Ipswich ended a 22-year wait for a home Premier League win. “One of the best nights,” said McKenna after closing out 2024 with a much-awaited win.</p> <p>“We’ve been privileged to have a lot of good nights. This was a special one for the players and supporters,” the manager said. Ipswich climb above Leicester to 19th, one point behind Wolves and two behind Everton.</p> <p>“There has been hope in the performances in general,” McKenna concluded. “We have been competing in almost every game. If you do that, you always have a chance.”</p>",

This is as human, as vulnerable, as vincible, as we have ever seen him on that stage. There’s a fearless crowd‑pleasing underdog out there playing like he’s got nothing to lose. And it’s not him.</p> \n<p>So, Luke Littler, what do you do at your moment of greatest peril? When this world championship last‑16 game is teetering on a pinhead, when an unfancied opponent 22 years older than you is throwing absolute bombs, when everything has been tried and nothing has worked? When millions are slowly sitting bolt upright on their sofas, in anticipation of an almighty upset?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/29/peter-wright-dethrones-pdc-world-champion-luke-humphries\">Peter Wright rolls back years to dethrone Luke Humphries at PDC world darts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Well, if you’re Littler, you mop up the match with legs of 12, 13 and 14 darts, producing an average of 111 in the deciding set. You let out a feral roar, not the roar of a kid but the roar of a prizefighter, a prizefighter who has just come through one of the most bloodying fights of his life. You shake hands and take your curtain call from an adoring public. You dust yourself off. And you go again on New Year’s Day, secure in the knowledge that on this stage what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.</p> \n<p>And Littler will be stronger for this punishing night in the People’s Palace, for solving a puzzle far tougher than anybody expected the world No 29 from Newcastle to set him. Three times Littler took the lead and three times Joyce pegged him back, grunting and harrumphing, skewering his doubles as if he wanted to kill them.</p> \n<p>Of course, for seasoned viewers of the man they call Relentless, very little of this was staggering. Ignore the novelty Tetris shirt and Tetris walk‑on music. Ignore the unwieldy action in which he seems to release the dart from somewhere near his hairline. Actually, ignore that ranking as well, which would probably be a good deal higher if he didn’t have a crippling fear of flying that has prevented him from turning out at many of the European Tour events for which he qualified.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"881b1844-346f-4fb1-9b6b-29df3253d519\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>[17] Peter Wright (Sco) v Stephen Bunting (Eng) [8]</p>\n    <p>[4] Luke Littler (Eng) v Nathan Aspinall (Eng) [12]</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>[15] Chris Dobey (Eng) v Gerwyn Price (Wal) [10]</p>\n    <p>[3] Michael van Gerwen (Neth) v Callan Rydz (Eng)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>All matches to be played 1 Jan 2025; times TBC</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Because when the darts are sitting nice in his fingers, Joyce can fling arrows with the best of them: two major semi-finals, the scalps of Rob Cross, Michael van Gerwen and Nathan Aspinall on TV this year alone.</p> \n<p>When they’re not, he can still kill you with the sort of lethal finishing that wins him legs he has no right to win. Even so, his record at Alexandra Palace since a 2019 quarter-final – three wins in five years – was surely relevant here, too.</p> \n<p>Instead it was Littler feeling the pressure: lots of frustrated tugging on the shirt, lots of facial tics, lots of sucking on imaginary eggs. His scoring was as ridiculously fecund as ever: an average of 103, his 14 180s putting him well clear on the tournament list. It was on the outer ring that he looked fallible: just 35% there, including missed set darts, missed match darts in sets six and seven.</p> \n<p>Plenty to work on, then, but also a growing sense of just what it will take to conquer here, the reserves of courage and bottle he will need to find. “Honestly, I think I went into 10th gear at one point there,” he said. “I had to. He threw everything at me. I just wanted him to miss.”</p> \n<p>Littler still favourite, then, but the resurgent <strong>Van Gerwen</strong> is also assembling a serious body of work. Here he fought off a sizzling fightback from Sweden’s Jeffrey de Graaf, powering to a 4-2 victory in the more open half of the draw. And with seeds around him dropping like a north London phone signal, he may never get a better opportunity to end his six-year wait for a fourth world title.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, he cut a less bombastic figure than usual. He talked about how much he was missing his kids. He paid tribute to the crowd. He even paid due deference to his next opponent, <strong>Callan Rydz</strong>, who has been playing some superb stuff. Something real has changed here: darts is no longer Van Gerwen’s alpha and omega, his sole reason for being. And yet somehow he seems more comfortable in his own skin than he ever was when he was dominant.</p> \n<p><strong>Stephen Bunting</strong>, meanwhile, is the cult hero in serious danger of becoming the real thing. Luke Woodhouse never stood a chance in a 4-0 whitewash, and certainly there would be few more popular winners of the trophy than this likeable Liverpudlian with a legendary social media game and one of the greatest walk-ons in the sport.</p> \n<p>He plays Peter Wright next, who obligingly took Luke Humphries out of his path on Sunday night. For Bunting, talent, confidence and opportunity are moving ominously into alignment.</p> \n<p>In Monday’s afternoon session, <strong>Nathan Aspinall </strong>powered past an out-of-sorts Ricardo Pietreczko 4-0 to set up a quarter-final with Littler, Rydz fought back to beat surprise package Robert Owen 4-3, and <strong>Chris Dobey </strong>edged past Kevin Doets. He will face Gerwyn Price when the quarter-finals get under way on Wednesday.</p>",

As the 1 May date approached, Blair’s cabinet appeared publicly supportive, but the papers suggest more fraught discussions behind the scenes.</p> <p>Prescott and Straw, who were deputy prime minister and foreign secretary at the time, wrote to Blair in February 2004. They both urged him to consider pushing back the 1 May start date. The original 15 EU member states could impose restrictions, including annual limits and work permits, for up to seven years after the 10 new states joined the bloc.</p> <p>In a letter dated 10 February 2004, Straw called on Blair to hold a meeting with himself, David Blunkett and Andrew Smith, who served as work and pensions secretary at the time, to consider a delay until “a rather less feverish time (hopefully) in, say, November [2004]”.</p> <p>He said: “if we do not think this through now”, the government could be forced to suspend the right to work for the new EU nationals “in the least propitious of circumstances”.</p> <p>The UK, Ireland and Sweden were the only pre-2004 EU member states to fully open their labour markets. Straw said that other EU member states that were assumed to be adopting a similar arrangement to the UK had “began to peel away”, including Germany and France, who ended up imposing restrictions.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/17/eu.politics2\">meeting</a> was subsequently scheduled for 17 February 2004. A day before the summit, Prescott wrote to Blair, saying he supported Straw’s position. He urged the prime minister not to introduce the measures on 1 May, instead saying they could be enacted in the “near future”. He added it was “very important that we get this right and do not adopt a position that we may have to reconsider within a short period”.</p> <p>He also voiced concerns about the impact the new EU nationals could have on public services, saying he was “extremely concerned about the additional pressures they could bring to bear on social housing”.</p> <p>Blunkett, who publicly welcomed the new EU citizens, also wrote to Blair, laying out his opposition to imposing restrictions on their right to work in the UK, saying such a scheme would “not only be expensive and bureaucratic but I believe ineffective”.</p> <p>He said a restrictive scheme could buy the government short-term political cover but would only be “storing up more deep-seated political difficulties in the very near future and closer to the general election”.</p> <p>Soon after the meeting, the government confirmed it was sticking to the 1 May date. After this date, EU citizens were able to arrive in the UK largely unrestricted; however, they were only able to claim benefits if they were in work.</p> <p>At the time, Home Office officials forecast a net increase of no more than 13,000 workers a year after 1 May 2004. In the weeks after, however, the files showed the numbers arriving were far outstripping these estimates. One official said they faced an “elephant trap” and advised ministers to “err on the side of publishing less rather than more” when it came to releasing official data.</p> <p>In the years after, net migration to the UK rose to more than 200,000 a year. Straw later said that the failure to put in place any transitional controls had been a “spectacular mistake” that had far-reaching consequences.</p> <p>The issue of freedom of movement would go on to strongly influence British politics in the 2010s. Ukip, which ran an anti-immigration campaign under Nigel Farage, won more than 3m votes in the 2015 general election. A year later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">UK voted to leave the EU</a> in a seismic political moment for the nation.</p>",

But politicians on the coalition provisional authority, set up after Saddam’s fall, feared the US military response could damage hopes of establishing an independent Iraqi administration.</p> <p>Bush backed off after being “faced with this ‘dose of reality’”, Manning reported back to No 10.</p> <p>“Rich summed it all up by saying Bush still thought he was on some sort of mission from God. But that recent events had made him ‘rather more sober’.”</p> <p>Bush had famously declared “mission accomplished” after the overthrow of Hussein by US and UK coalition forces. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/07/usa.jamessturcke\">White House has previously dismissed as “absurd” reports</a> that Bush privately told a Palestinian delegation in 2003 that God spoke to him and said: “George, go fight these terrorists in Afghanistan” and “George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq.”</p> <p>Armitage dismissed claims by the overall US commander in Iraq, Gen John Abizaid, that he could put down the Falluja uprising within days as “bullshit” and “politically crass”. Armitage believed the US was “gradually losing on the battlefield” and that it was “inevitable” the administration would have to send more troops, which would be “politically ugly” for Bush, Manning reported.</p> <p>No 10 was nervous about the US military response. A briefing document, ahead of Blair’s Washington visit in April 2004, said events in Falluja had “used up a great deal of the coalition’s political capital”.</p> <p>“Publicly we will want to underline our continued commitment to seeing the task through, but privately we will need to deliver some difficult messages to Bush about the need for a more measured approach by the US military, under proper political oversight, and the need for a clear end to the occupation on July 1,” it said.</p> <p>It added: “The prime minister might question Bush on whether there is proper political control of military operations,” and concluded: “In short, too many military officers talking tough to a US audience, with little attention to the effect on an Iraqi or regional audience.”</p> <p>Blair’s foreign policy adviser, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, described the UK’s main concerns in a memo to the prime minister as “clumsy US handling”, “disproportionate US military tactics – what they did in Falluja looked on Iraqi TV screens to be a form of collective punishment” and “apocalyptic media treatment”.</p> <p>The US lost 27 troops, while about 200 insurgents and 600 Iraqi civilians were thought to have been killed in Falluja at that time. Coalition forces took the city in a second offensive launched in November 2004. US troops remained in Iraq until 2011.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The Live Aid campaigner Bob Geldof urged Tony Blair not to appoint an African co-chair to the UK-led organisation working to overhaul international aid to the continent because he thought African leadership was “very weak” on the issue, newly released government documents suggest.</p> <p>The singer was “scathing about the ability and worthiness of virtually all African leaders” before the establishment in 2004 of Blair’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/mar/11/internationalaidanddevelopment.hearafrica053\">Commission for Africa</a>, which would produce a report, Our Common Interest, and prompt a landmark pledge by rich nations to boost aid and write off debt.</p> <p>Geldof was instrumental in persuading the then prime minister to set up a “Brandt II” report, similar to the 1980 Brandt report on international economic development, which would lead to a “Marshall plan” for Africa, a reference to the US plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. It would coincide with the UK’s presidency of the G8 nations group and the 20th anniversary of Live Aid.</p> <p>But behind the scenes, Geldof and the government had different ideas on how it should be set up, official papers released to the National Archives show.</p> <p>Geldof stressed in one letter to the prime minister that Blair’s personal leadership was vital if it was to succeed. “I do think this needs to be a direct commission from you personally – your vision, your authority, your weight,” he wrote.</p> <p>He also called for speed so it could report back in time for the G8 summit that Blair was hosting at Gleneagles in July 2005. “I know I’m pushy, and I know you’re up to your neck, but something short of the normal seven-week delay response would be welcome (do you use Royal Mail?). Seriously though, this must be implemented almost immediately,” Geldof wrote.</p> <p>A No 10 letter from October 2003, reporting on a telephone conversation between Blair and Geldof, said: “The PM spoke with Bob Geldof today. Geldof argued that unless we found a way to allow Africans to make livelihoods at home they would come to our shores, resulting in massive social upheaval. African leadership had been very weak.”</p> <p>Other Downing Street officials urged caution. One said they could face “opprobrium” from Geldof and his fellow Live Aid campaigner Bono if they were unable to deliver on the plan.</p> <p>Liz Lloyd, a senior adviser on international development, expressed concern over Geldof’s desire that the commission, while being chaired by Blair, should also be independent, and she stressed the government must have oversight.</p> <p>“If this document is going to have your name and be sold by you, [Geldof] must accept that we have the final editing role,” she wrote to Blair.</p> <p>The fact Geldof was opposed to a chair from Africa was particularly “tricky”, she added. “He is scathing about the ability and worthiness of virtually all African leaders and sees the audience as primarily the US,” she noted.</p> <p>“He therefore does not want an African co-chair, content to ride with your name to give it credibility.”</p> <p>She continued that they would need “prominent African involvement” and suggested Blair “talk carefully” to the then South African president, Thabo Mbeki, to secure his support.</p> <p>The ensuing pledge at Gleneagles to double aid and extend debt relief was hailed by Geldof as “mission accomplished”, although some anti-poverty campaigners complained that he had got too close to the government and that it did not go far enough.</p>",

It is therefore no surprise that people turn to A&amp;E for treatment of more minor issues,” he said.</p> <p>This in turn placed extra demand on emergency care teams already dealing with the extra pressures that came with winter, Boyle said. “This is a vicious cycle which means there is less capacity to treat the people who are most in need of urgent care.”</p> <p>Dr Tim Cooksley, the immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said patients were losing confidence in their ability to access primary or community care. “They will access any care they can in desperate times and have often sought alternatives before presenting.”</p> <p>Prof Julian Redhead, NHS England’s clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said A&amp;Es were experiencing “record levels of demand”, and urged the public to “play their part” by only turning to them for serious injuries or life-threatening emergencies.</p>",

This is an even greater margin of support than seen <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/should-uk-private-schoold-be-exempt-from-tax\">in similar polls</a> carried out before the election.</p> <p>In the run-up to the start of the policy there have been repeated attacks by the Conservatives and from voices in rightwing newspapers, with one accusing the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, of being motivated by “class envy”.</p> <p>The polling of more than 2,000 people showed wider disquiet with the status quo, with 57% saying they found the overall private education system to be unfair and 22% disagreeing.</p> <p>It also showed strong support for the idea of UK private schools being obliged to open a quarter of their places for free to local children, to improve social mixing.</p> <p>A government source said: “This is yet more conclusive evidence of the overwhelming support for this Labour government’s policy of removing tax breaks from private schools to invest in the state sector.</p> <p>“With every hysterical headline attacking our policy, the Tories and their backers in the rightwing press show the public just how out of touch they are.</p> <p>“And by pledging to restore tax breaks to the privileged few at the expense of investment in state schools used by the many, the Conservatives show they have learned nothing from their humbling election defeat.”</p> <p>Downing Street backed Phillipson on Monday after she argued that the bulk of middle-class parents had been priced out by soaring private school fees and were therefore likely to support the policy.</p> <p>Private school fees had risen by about 75% in real terms since 2000, with the average annual cost per child now about £18,000 a year, “which is clearly out of reach for the majority of parents in our country”, Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The government has been very clear that by ending this VAT break for private schools, it means an additional £1.7bn of investment into our state schools, where 94% of this country’s children are educated.</p> <p>“It’s the right thing to do. It means more teachers. It means higher standards.”</p> <p>The sum of £1.7bn is expected to be reached by 2029-30, with the government estimating the first full<strong> </strong>year of the policy<strong>, </strong>2025-26<strong>,</strong> will bring in about £1.5bn. The aim is to spend the revenue recruiting 6,500 extra teachers for the state sector, and help mental health provision in schools.</p> <p>One of the arguments made by critics against the change is that other European countries do not tend to tax private education. But Francis Green, a professor of work and education economics at University College London, who led the PEPF polling, said this was not necessarily a fair comparison.</p> <p>For example, he said, while a higher proportion of French children go to private schools, these tend to have much lower fees, with the state paying teachers’ wages.</p> <p>“I suspect it’s true that if you looked across Europe, you would not find a sales tax or a VAT tax on private schools,” he said.</p> <p>“But the British private school system is a unique outlier. It’s a substantial and very exclusive sector of the education system. When they say no other countries do it, that doesn’t mean to say that we shouldn’t do it.”</p> <p>Given public opinion, he added, private schools may be better served giving up their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/31/private-schools-to-take-legal-action-against-planned-vat-on-fees\">opposition to the policy change</a> and instead trying to “enter constructively into the debate” about how to make themselves more socially accessible.</p>",

We were spared the initial impact of the GFC largely because, still bearing the scars of financial disasters in the 1980s and early 1990s, Australian financial institutions had been slow to embrace the exotic derivatives that brought down their counterparts in the US and UK. That delay allowed time for vigorous fiscal stimulus (here and in China, our main export market) to stave off the long and deep recessions seen elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/30/millions-of-australians-missing-out-on-easy-power-savings-by-not-switching-deals-accc-says\">Millions of Australians miss out on saving hundreds of dollars by not switching energy deals, ACCC says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But a few days ago, Jim Chalmers made comments suggesting that Australia’s financial system will not be insulated from a crisis that seems all too likely to emerge in the next few years. When Donald Trump assumes his role as the US president, it will bring an end to policies that have maintained a wall of separation between the traditional financial system and the crypto sector. Chalmers, citing Trump’s moves, has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-chalmers-says-the-future-may-be-crypto-20241223-p5l0cm.html\">suggested that Australia will follow suit</a>.</p> <p>Much of the concern about the incorporation of crypto into the financial system has focused on the fact that crypto prices are highly volatile. This ought not to be a concern: commodity prices are volatile, but commodity futures have been traded in financial markets for well over a century. Indeed, the central role of financial markets is to manage risk and volatility.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The real problem is that crypto is essentially worthless. A typical crypto asset, such as a bitcoin, is a certification that the producer has performed a complex, but uninteresting, mathematical calculation (roughly, finding an input to a complicated function which produces an output near enough to zero). No one can make any use of this.</p> <p>By contrast, other assets, including those used as currency, have value either because they are useful or desirable in themselves (like gold and silver) or because a government is willing to accept them as payment for tax obligations, like fiat currency. Stocks and corporate bonds represent a claim on the earnings and assets of the companies that issue them. And so on. Unless the Trump administration decides to treat bitcoin in the same way as US dollars (the idea has been proposed!), none of these applies to crypto.</p> <p>What this means is that, as soon as people decide that crypto is valueless it will become so. As holders seek to cash out, the price will fall, producing more sales, with no stable floor above zero.</p> <p>At this point, it might reasonably be objected that critics (like me) have been calling crypto worthless ever since its introduction in 2009, and yet its price has soared spectacularly. It’s worth observing that the relatively simple Ponzi scheme operated by the late Bernie Madoff ran for at least 17 years, with the sum involved growing into tens of billions of dollars. He was only exposed by the GFC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/30/new-years-eve-fireworks-nye-guide-2024-sydney-melbourne-brisbane-where-what-time-to-watch-australia\">New Year’s Eve fireworks 2024: the best places to watch NYE celebrations around Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In previous downturns in the crypto market, the loss in value has affected owners of crypto who are unwilling or unable to “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp\">Hold On for Dear Life</a>”, but had no effect on the mainstream financial sector. By contrast, in the next few years, the exposure of traditional institutions is likely to run into the hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions. Mortgages will increasingly be secured against crypto collateral and serviced by the (hoped-for) profits from crypto speculation. Loans to crypto exchanges, which have been restricted in the past, will be allowed and encouraged, creating more opportunities for contagious collapse.</p> <p>An obvious starting point for a crash would be a failure of one of the crucial, but opaque, “stablecoins”, which are designed to trade at a fixed price of one US dollar, and to facilitate the conversion of crypto into fiat currency. Tether, the leading stablecoin, claims assets of over $100bn, but has never produced more than a vague account of what those assets are. Chalmers’ statement includes a promise of legislation for “payment stablecoin” reforms, but it is hard to see how Australia can regulate a global firm like Tether.</p> <p>A combination of good luck and good management, in which Jim Chalmers played a prominent role, helped Australia avoid most of the consequences of the GFC. If crypto is allowed to play a prominent role in our financial system, we will be counting entirely on luck to avoid a future disaster.</p> <ul> <li><p>John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economics</p></li> </ul>",

The defeat came after first-half goals from Alexander Isak and Joelinton and is United’s fourth consecutive loss in all competitions and the first time three consecutive home league matches have been lost since 1978-79.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/30/manchester-united-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Isak and Joelinton help Newcastle overwhelm feeble Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Our club needs a shock and we have to understand that,” Amorim said. “It is also why I speak of relegation. That is really clear [the possibility] and we have to fight. It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty&nbsp;and to be clear with that, we have&nbsp;to fight [in] the next game.”</p> <p>That next game is the difficult trip&nbsp;to Liverpool, the league leaders, on Sunday. Amorim has endured five&nbsp;defeats in his first eight league matches, the poorest of any United manager for 103 years, but he will&nbsp;have little money to strengthen next month unless major sales are&nbsp;made.</p> <p>“We don’t have that possibility in January if we don’t take [sell] some players,” Amorim said. “You know the situation better than me. It is not that I am arriving here and can spend&nbsp;money changing the team.”</p> <p>The squad that Amorim inherited was not built for his 3-4-3 formation. The head coach was asked why he did not wait until the close season to implement it. “When you have a change of&nbsp;coach, especially in this type of club, it is because they were not winning,” he said. “They play in the system they were bought for and were losing. So I am going to change to that system? This team was already in trouble.”</p> <p>Marcus Rashford was reinstated to the match squad but remained an unused substitute. Amorim was asked why. “I think about the team, you a lot about Marcus. I just want to win the game,” he said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has urged voters not to let the “owners of social media channels” decide next year’s snap election, after Elon Musk repeatedly endorsed the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).</p> \n<p>In a New Year’s Eve address recorded for television and made available before its broadcast on Tuesday, Scholz said German citizens alone had the power to decide “where Germany goes from here” after the general election on 23 February.</p> \n<p>“It will not be decided by the owners of social media channels,” Scholz said of the country’s future.</p> \n<p>“In our debates, one can be forgiven for sometimes thinking the more extreme an opinion is, the more attention it will garner.” Rather, Scholz said, the fate of German society “will be up to the vast majority of reasonable and decent people”.</p> \n<p>Without mentioning Musk or his platform, X, explicitly, Scholz urged Germans to resist manipulation and to stand up for their democracy.</p> \n<p>“After all, it’s customary to make wishes on New Year’s Eve. What I wish for is that we will not let ourselves be played off each other,” he said.</p> \n<p>Scholz noted there had been a surge of disinformation on social media after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/magdeburg-christmas-market-attack\">Christmas market attack</a> in Magdeburg on 20 December in which five people were killed and more than 200 injured. The car ramming was allegedly committed by a Saudi-born assailant with far-right sympathies.</p> \n<p>“No small number of these rumours and conjectures, though, have meanwhile been debunked. These things divide and weaken us,” he said. “This is not good for our country.”</p> \n<p>On Monday, a spokesperson for Scholz, Christiane Hoffmann, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/30/german-official-elon-musk-trying-to-influence-election-afd\">accused Musk of trying to meddle</a> in the country’s election campaign with a series of declarations backing the anti-Muslim, anti-migration AfD party.</p> \n<p>“It is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election,” Hoffmann said at a regular media briefing. Musk had the right to free speech, she said, adding: “After all, freedom of opinion also covers the greatest nonsense.”</p> \n<p>Musk has often weighed in on German politics, even calling Scholz a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854558548732121169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854558548732121169%7Ctwgr%5E10e34a7336b069c1ebb30886804a4cfe7ca3eefe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fnetzwelt%2Fweb%2Felon-musk-nennt-olaf-scholz-einen-narr-bundesregierung-kontert-beschimpfung-a-aaf117cf-0588-49f4-85db-d54b1aa19d49\">“fool”</a> on X last month.

His SPD is widely expected to lose to Merz’s CDU/CSU bloc amid voter anger over the cost of living and meagre economic growth.</p> \n<p>AfD members have been working for months to make inroads with the Trump camp, seeking to harness his electoral momentum for the German campaign. Alice Weidel, the party’s co-leader, was one of the first foreign politicians to <a href=\"https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/neue-rechte/2024/11/08/trumps-freunde-bei-der-afd/\">welcome Trump’s victory</a>.</p> \n<p>A small group of AfD activists posed for pictures with Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/07/far-right-activists-from-germany-spent-us-election-day-at-trumps-mar-a-lago\">at his private club Mar-a-Lago</a> on US election day last month, chanting “Fight! Fight! Fight!” in English and German.</p> \n<p>Musk’s endorsement in Die Welt cited Weidel’s “same-sex partner from Sri Lanka” as evidence that the portrayal of the AfD “as rightwing extremist is clearly false”. “Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” he wrote.</p> \n<p>The AfD is <a href=\"https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/\">polling second</a> on about 19%, behind the CDU/CSU on 31%. A strong showing for the party could complicate coalition building, requiring the election winner to seek up to two partners to build a ruling majority.

Manchester United improved in the second half, hitting the post through Harry Maguire, but Newcastle were practically in a neutral gear by then, for the most part coasting home serenely. They celebrate their victory with quiet contentment, having stylishly conquered a venue they rarely enjoy visiting. The hosts meanwhile slink off sheepishly, Ruben Amorim scratching his chin pensively. This is the first time Manchester United have lost three consecutive home league matches since 1978-79, and the first time they’ve been defeated five times in the league in a calendar month since <em>September 1962</em>. They finished 19th out of 22 that season. Matt Busby’s side did go on to win the FA Cup, mind.

She reportedly said it was her second attempt to kill the goat.</p> <p>Investigators who searched her phone history found that she had searched “how much bleach can kill an animal” and “poisoning pets, what you should know”, <a href=\"https://people.com/aubrey-vanlandingham-accused-poisoning-show-goat-force-feed-pesticide-8767478\">People reported</a>. She also allegedly searched “how to clear search history”.</p> <p>Vanlandingham faces up to two years in prison if convicted of cruelty to livestock animals.</p> <p>The mother of the 15-year-old girl whose goat was killed said her family wanted “justice” and hoped Vanlandingham would receive jail time if found guilty.</p> <p>“We were there when he passed away. My daughter was actually holding him. So that was very traumatic,” she <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14224857/texas-cheerleader-animal-cruelty-rival-goat-aubrey-vanlandingham.html\">told the Daily Mail</a>.</p> <p>“We don’t believe there is any remorse there,” the mother added. “We want justice served, we don’t want a slap on the wrist. We want to make sure that she is punished.”</p>",

The lead campaigner, Sir Alan Bates, was knighted earlier this year.</p> <p>Hundreds of Post Office branch operators were persecuted and some prosecuted when the faulty Horizon IT system reported shortfalls in their funds. Many are still awaiting compensation.</p> <p>Castleton, from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, was made bankrupt after the system reported that £25,000 was missing from his branch in 2004.

I’m very honoured and very proud.</p> <p>“Obviously, it’s one of those things where it’s not the end. It’s just sad that it’s been prolonged and protracted by the other side and it would be nice to just draw a line under everything with something like this – but onwards and upwards.”</p> <p>Misra was jailed when she was pregnant after evidence provided by the Horizon system was accepted as evidence of her guilt over a charge of stealing £74,000 from her branch in West Byfleet, Surrey, in 2005.

On television, in the high street – even in normally sacred places like church”), she’s done the history of Britain (“He had six wives all called Catherine. He was a Catherineoholic, or Catholic for short”) and she’s done Earth (“It’s difficult to believe I’m standing in the&nbsp;world’s oldest city, because I’m not”). Now, finally, we have&nbsp;Philomena Cunk on life.</p> <p>Bolton’s finest and worst-informed pundit-presenter, who first graced our screens in Charlie Brooker’s Weekly Wipe and is played by the perennially deadpan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/sep/28/philomena-cunk-history-world-according-interview\">Diane Morgan</a>, has returned for a seasonal special that takes us through the profundities that “humanitkind” has puzzled over for centuries and the various ways we have tried to make sense of our lives through art, religion and philosophy.</p> <p>As ever, she interviews a variety of experts “to ask some of the most significant questions you can ask with a mouth”. Beyond the gags lies the game of trying to work out how much each of the “professional mammals” is aware of the parodic intent and who is playing as straight a bat as he or she seems to be. We can be relatively sure that Brian Cox and Jim Al-Khalili know what is going on, but there is every chance, I would say, that the University of Cambridge professor of the philosophy of religion Douglas Hedley (tweed, corduroy, Heseltine mane) has not yet made the acquaintance of Cunk and is still sitting in the panelled study where she left him, musing on whether or not God is “even in cupboards”. But the increasing degrees of bafflement demonstrated by the King’s College London professor of surgery Prokar Dasgupta as Cunk’s questions and assertions mount (“Only 40% of people have skeletons”; “Knees are a con”) makes him either a beautiful naif or the greatest actor since Laurence Olivier. Respect is due, either way. I would like someone at University College London to check on&nbsp;their English professor Greg Dart, though. I think she may have broken him.</p> <p>Religion and medicine done, she turns her attention to art. She is not a fan of Vincenzo van Beethoven Gogh. “No detail to his crows,” she says, pointing at one of his wheat fields paintings. “It’s actively bad. Better if he’d never painted anything, not even a bog door in a home for the blind. Anyway, that’s my view. What do you think?” The camera pans to reveal the man standing on the other side of the frame – the history of art professor Richard Thomson, from the University of&nbsp;Edinburgh. He might need to be checked on, too.</p> <p>The rest is the familiar mix of jangled factoids (“Darwin rode a beagle to the Galápagos, where a giant tortoise gave him an idea”), distinctive turns of phrase (“a form of organised grovelling called worship”) and moments that transcend capture by mere words, such as Cunk’s face when Prof Joyce Harper talks her through the human reproductive process. “Christ,” says Cunk. “I hope nothing like that ever happens to me.” There is the running gag about the release of Belgian techno anthem Pump Up the Jam being Cunk’s main method of measuring the passage of time, and another involving the minuscule difference between the northern pronunciation of “our souls” and the word “arseholes”, which Brooker and his writing team clearly feels is too good to waste. Your mileage may vary.</p> <p>We get plenty of pure Cunk commentary, too, which for those of us with a low embarrassment threshold is a blessed relief from the interviews. It is also a joy in its own right, as she explains with her customary earnest confidence how we are all “mutated from monkey meat”, that “female genitals are kept indoors for safekeeping” and that Fyodor Dostoevsky is “the author of several books still not read to this day”. She later asks what Dart would give Crime and Punishment out of 10. “Nine?” he whispers. I do worry.</p> <p>The show feels a little more scattergun than usual, with Brooker’s personal obsessions (so many jabs at Apple and its products) being revealed too often. The 70 minutes could have been tightened to an hour with very little lost – indeed, quite a lot gained. But it is impossible not to remain a fan. Morgan is peerless, the jokes plentiful and wide-ranging, from the light twistings by people who know exactly what the facts are and how far they can be stretched for comic effect all the way through to the “our souls”. Merry&nbsp;Christmas, everyone.</p> <p>• Philomena Cunk on Life aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer, and will be on Netflix in Australia from 2 January</p>",

After 11 games, the Portuguese coach’s record reads six defeats, four wins and one draw. Peer at the table and&nbsp;United are 14th on 22 points. No ­wonder, afterwards, Amorim admitted rele­gation is a threat and “our club needs&nbsp;a shock”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/30/ipswich-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Hutchinson haunts his former club as Ipswich make Chelsea pay for rotation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once more the 3-4-3 formation failed, and Joshua Zirkzee being yanked off after half an hour is a glaring emblem of United’s ­disarray. Another was the reinstatement of Marcus Rashford to the squad after the forward said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/17/marcus-rashford-manchester-united-new-challenge\">he wanted a “new challenge”</a>; make sense of the head coach’s thinking on that one, if you can. Amorim keeps on saying he has to follow his “idea” to the end but it will prove pure folly if the side ­repeatedly lose and players become more disenchanted.</p> <p>There is a good reason why ­Antonio Conte’s Chelsea of 2016-17 are the sole three-centre-back champions of the Premier League era and it is because the system is not proactive and can be overrun in midfield, as United were here. Three minutes and 30 seconds was all it took for Amorim to bow his head. Fluid from Newcastle, amateurish by United who, despite having Matthijs de Ligt, Harry ­Maguire and Lisandro Martínez lined up, still allowed Alexander Isak to rise before André Onana’s goal and head in.</p> <p>Maguire and Martínez were the prime culprits as the in-form Swede split them to score an eighth goal in his past seven outings. Already, Amorim’s men looked like a pub XI who had staggered on to the local park midway through an enjoyable festive season. Noussair Mazraoui was their next chump as Anthony Gordon’s dazzling speed left the right wing-back trailing before the Newcastle winger teed up Joelinton, whose radar failed.</p> <p>Amorim, again, felt even more disgust when, again, Eddie Howe’s side scored with ease. It came thanks to a United midfield that was warm butter to Newcastle’s red-hot knife. Possession was worked to Gordon, he stood the ball up and Joelinton made the hapless Martínez look like a schoolboy by rising and heading the second.</p> <p>Amorim was to blame for the gaping holes as, with Manuel Ugarte and Bruno Fernandes unavailable, he eschewed the 19-year-old legs of Kobbie Mainoo to send Casemiro and Christian Eriksen – at a combined age of 64– into combat against Newcastle’s muscular trio of Joelinton, ­Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimarães.</p>    <p>The visiting fans were delighted, taunting their hosts with the killer line from the Beach Boys’ Sloop John B – “this is the best trip I’ve ever been on” – and, soon, were in louder raptures. A Tonali effort provoked a corner and Kieran Trippier’s delivery went close to beating Onana, as he had been from the set piece in the 2-0 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/26/wolves-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">defeat by Wolves</a> on Boxing Day. The follow-up threatened, too, but not as much as Tonali, who hit a post moments after.</p> <p>How could Amorim and his side feel even worse? By the 39-year-old deciding, 32 minutes in, that his selection was so dismal that Zirkzee should be removed for Mainoo. He dropped in alongside Casemiro, Eriksen ­taking the humiliated Dutchman’s berth. After Zirkzee trotted straight down the tunnel (he returned), United’s only hope was Newcastle giving this away: Fabian Schär tried, looping the ball straight to Mainoo, whose pass found Casemiro but his chip-cross found no one. United had returned the poorest 45 minutes of Amorim’s brief tenure, and the second half was a test for each manager: could Howe maintain his team’s excellence or might Amorim engineer a revival?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/30/manchester-united-face-really-clear-threat-of-relegation-admits-amorim\">Manchester United face ‘really clear’ threat of relegation, admits Amorim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rasmus Højlund earned a corner, United’s first, on 51 minutes, but Eriksen’s execution was as effective as Casemiro’s outside-of-the-boot cross, after it broke. Still, brighter from the hosts. An Amad Diallo attempt was repelled and United tapped the ball about, exerting control, in a phase culminating in ­Maguire’s diving header, which&nbsp;rapped Martin Dubravka’s right post.</p> <p>Suddenly Old Trafford was a cauldron, United’s vigour giving the faithful something to believe in. Amorim introduced Leny Yoro and Alejandro Garnacho for Martínez and Casemiro, leaving Rashford a spectator still, with Maguire taking the armband. Yoro flashed a header wide and on jogged Antony for De Ligt. But, bottom line: there is no thrust or menace about United. Amorim is overseeing a plunge.</p> <p>This was Newcastle’s second league win here since 1972 and a first in 11 years. Isak said: “It feels great, we haven’t won in a long time here: the perfect way to end this year.”</p>",

Two defeats and a draw over the festive period leave them 10 points behind Liverpool, not so much holding on to coattails as left for dust. At full-time, Ipswich began a lap of honour McKenna tried his best to dampen, mindful of huge challenges ahead, though that was delayed by a fracas where Chelsea tempers had clearly frayed.</p> <p>“No one expected us to be where we are,” Maresca said. “We are in a good position but we can do many things better. We are not focused on the title race or those things.”</p> <p>Had he taken Ipswich too lightly? Maresca’s reputation as a decisive manager was enhanced by dropping Robert Sánchez for Filip Jörgensen after a costly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/26/chelsea-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">goalkeeping error against Fulham</a>, but his other selections flopped. With a sizeable squad to hand, and clear signs of fatigue, the selection bore a resemblance to a Conference League team, particularly in the presence of the mysterious João Félix.</p> <p>Was a factor Ipswich’s status as a bottom-three club without a home win all season? McKenna, a contender for the job that went to Maresca, ended up extending Chelsea’s blue Christmas. He, too, had shuffled out a keeper, Christian Walton replacing Arijanet Muric, and after a fine display it was the League One veteran who led the post-match chorus.</p>    <p>“One of the best nights,” McKenna said. “We’ve been privileged to have a lot of good nights.” Six of his starting lineup had played League One football under him.</p> <p>Chelsea were caught cold. Delap crashed into Levi Colwill with unseasonal intent to begin his wrecking‑ball display. The early energy brought swift reward. Leif Davis’s ball sent Delap away and Jörgensen’s penalty-box challenge was hasty. Did Delap accentuate contact? It looked that way but the referee’s call was followed.</p> <p>Delap drilled home and might have had another soon after, only for Jörgensen to partially redeem himself. Chelsea were sluggish, as lethargic in attack as defence, Félix incapable of staying upright. His re‑signing remains a riddle. Christopher Nkunku, equally, was slow to pounce when Cole Palmer’s free-kick hit the post, the Frenchman failing to beat Walton.</p> <p>Ipswich’s soft underbelly, so often weighing down a team who win hearts through attacking play, was exposed when Palmer’s pass found Félix in position to score and then perform an elaborate celebration targeted at the haters. Problematically for the one-time €100m-plus playmaker, he had been half-a-yard offside. Disturbingly for Ipswich, Palmer was now strolling with intent, with far too much freedom.</p> <p>As the half closed, bull-like on the counter, dragging Chelsea defenders off him like rag dolls, Delap forced a near-post save from Jörgensen, in turn matched by Walton acrobatically tipping over a Palmer rocket. The Wythenshawe wizard smiled ruefully, with the confidence of expecting more where that came from. And yet it never arrived. Palmer became lost in the fug of Chelsea’s inferior second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/31/enzo-maresca-chelsea-ipswich-kieran-mckenna-quotes\">Enzo Maresca insists Chelsea going ‘in right direction’ despite Ipswich shock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They at least began the second half with heightened energy. Long moments of heavy pressure asked existential questions of Ipswich; surely life in the Premier League is about more than last-ditch defence only to lose?</p> <p>The answer Ipswich have been looking for since August came with their second goal. Axel Disasi, close to a headline-writer’s dream, played a no-look pass into Delap’s path. The striker’s intelligent cutback gave Hutchinson room to score against a club that discarded him and celebrate with a backflip of vindication.</p> <p>“Copy and paste, we conceded the goal because of a mistake,” Maresca said. His immediate response was to end Félix’s evening. On came Nicolas Jackson. Nkunku soon departed, not much less ineffective. Delap – the one‑man, 21-year-old attack – was meanwhile having the time of his life.</p> <p>Teasing the ball past Moisés Caicedo and then holding off Marc Cucurella, he forced another save from Jörgensen, whose overall performance suggested the wisdom of Maresca’s selection in that department had been correct. Jackson missed a one‑on-one as Chelsea began to flail with the frustration that eventually boiled over. Ipswich could begin the celebrations with 2024, a landmark year in the club’s history, closed in style.</p>",

Chances came and went with great regularity, with 20 attempts but only four on ­target. Rogers was&nbsp;a&nbsp;­constant&nbsp;menace with his direct&nbsp;running and skilful ­dribbling, making Lamptey’s night a ­difficult one, but the hosts struggled in the early stages to threaten Bart ­Verbruggen’s goal.</p> <p>Turning the Villa defence was a key strategy for Brighton. It was a long punt over the top from Lewis Dunk that resulted in the opener as Ezri Konsa and Pau Torres, who later sustained a suspected broken ­metatarsal, failed to deal with the matter when the ball dropped in the&nbsp;box, allowing Adingra to step in&nbsp;and curl beyond Emiliano Martínez into the corner.</p> <p>Emery used his programme notes to bemoan VAR and was once again left irritated by the officials&nbsp;when they ruled that Jan Paul van&nbsp;Hecke had got&nbsp;the ball after an ill‑advised lunge on Rogers in the&nbsp;box. The Villa manager threw out his arms when the video officials declared there was no need to overturn the original decision. He need not have worried because, in the next action, João Pedro kicked ­Rogers when trying to clear a corner and, this&nbsp;time, Craig Pawson, the ­referee, eventually changed his mind at the screen after ruling Verbruggen was not impeded seconds before the foul, much to Fabian Hürzeler’s ­chagrin. Watkins, on his 29th birthday, did the rest.</p> <p>“You can give the pen but you can’t not give the foul on Bart,” ­Hürzeler, who was booked for his complaints, said. “In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him it’s always a foul so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer.”</p>    <p>It was only right that ­Rogers’s ­terrorising of Brighton was rewarded when the visitors failed to clear their lines in the 47th ­minute. Watkins chipped a pass over the defence that Rogers chested down and ­immediately fired the ball into the corner for&nbsp;his sixth goal of an electrifying season. The winger was the best player on the pitch by a distance, having already earned a ­penalty, and&nbsp;was&nbsp;causing panic to those dressed in yellow.</p> <p>Unai Emery said: “I think we deserved to win, we played more or less in the same form in the last match we played at home&nbsp;[against Manchester City] but sometimes that is enough. I think we need to be proud of everything we’ve done this year. We&nbsp;are finishing the first part of the season, and the year, and we have to be proud of everything we did.”</p> <p>Hürzeler did what he could to get Brighton into the game by ­making a triple change before the hour. Kaoru Mitoma and Yankuba Minteh brought some much-needed verve to their output and it was the ­Japanese winger who helped to create the ­equaliser when he found João Pedro in the box, who laid the ball into the path of Lamptey to take a touch and fire into the corner from 18 yards.</p> <p>Lamptey had earned greater freedom from Rogers being moved ­centrally after a tactical tweak, ­allowing him to push further ­forward without fear of being exposed if things went awry, but it was Villa who were punished.</p> <p>“I think we were a better team, we created better chances, we controlled the game, especially in the first 20-25 minutes,” Hürzeler said. “We made the equaliser, we had another two or three big, big moments, big chances, where we easily could score the third goal. When you come back it’s always good, but in the end I think we deserved much more.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Snake hips, good core strength and a willingness to look slightly ridiculous all come in helpful for those wishing to master the art of hula hooping. Now scientists have concluded that an hourglass figure may also be advantageous.</p> <p>The study, involving gyrating robotic figures of various dimensions, suggests a narrow waist and large hips are optimal for keeping a hoop spinning in a stable position. But those with less curvy physiques may be able to compensate by making larger hip movements at a faster pace, the analysis concluded.</p> <p>“You need to throw the hoop sufficiently fast as your initial condition. You also need sufficient curvature of the body. You also need a sufficiently sloped body,” said Olivia Pomerenk, a PhD candidate at New York University and co-author of the analysis.</p> <p>The paper is the culmination of about five years of research by applied mathematicians at New York University, who began investigating because “there’s such a fundamental question about how the hoop actually stays up”.</p> <p>“It seems as though your body is only pushing the hoop outwards, you can’t immediately understand what is holding it up,” said Pomerenk, who joined the project more recently. “It’s a seemingly simple system, but actually involves quite intricate maths.”</p> <p>To tackle this mystery, the researchers 3D printed a series of plastic shapes: cylinders, cones and hourglass-like figures (hyperboloids) with varying slopes and curvatures. “A cylinder has no slope and no curvature. A cone has slope but no curvature – it is angled but it’s a flat line,” said Pomerenk. An hourglass has both slope and curvature.</p> <p>The shapes were coated in rubber, mounted on gyrating poles and recorded using high-speed cameras as hoops were whirled around them.</p> <p>The experiments suggest that three crucial conditions need to be met for a reliable hoop spin to be maintained. First, the hoop needs to be launched with enough vigour.</p> <p>“A first frustration faced by novices is how to launch the hoop to initiate twirling, and our experiments similarly involve false starts in which the hoop loses contact with the body if the launch speed is low,” the paper says.</p> <p>The best launch strategy involves beginning with both the hoop and the body centre displaced to the same side, the paper suggests.</p> <p>The analysis, published in the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2411588121\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, found that below a critical waist/hip ratio and when the waist was too angular, rather than following a smooth curve, it was impossible to attain a stable spin.</p> <p>In real life, hula hooping should be possible for most people, Pomerenk said, because in general “you don’t have humans with no slope or curvature”. Those with less optimal body shapes may need to gyrate more vigorously to keep the hoop spinning. Another option is using a hoop with a larger circumference, the paper suggests. The weight of the hoop appeared to be less important in determining its dynamics.</p> <p>According to the authors, the findings may have useful applications in how to harvest energy from vibrating objects or manipulate objects using rotational forces instead of gripping them.</p>",

He escaped through the same second-floor window at 5.30pm.</p>    <p>While inside, he managed to break into a safe where some of the jewels were kept, with others swiped from a dressing island.</p> <p>The suspect, who was armed with a weapon, was captured breaking in by security cameras, which also recorded him scouring rooms in the 22,000 sq ft (2,045 sq metre) mansion. His face was covered and police and private investigators are trying to identify him. </p> <p>The targeted family are offering rewards running into hundreds of thousands of pounds for the man’s capture and the return of the jewellery.</p>    <p>About eight people, including staff and some family members, were in the five-storey mansion at the time. The family are originally from Hong Kong. </p> <p>Police said the burglar escaped with £150,000 worth of Hermès Crocodile Kelly handbags, £15,000 in cash, and bespoke jewellery worth £10.4m.</p> <p>Among the jewels was a Graff<strong> </strong>10.73-carat diamond ring, two butterfly diamond rings by De Beers, a Hermès 3.03-carat ring, aquamarine ring and “Niloticus Lumière” necklace, as well as numerous other items including pink sapphire earrings from Katherine Wang shaped like butterflies, police said.</p> <p>CCTV shows the suspect is a white man in his late 20s to 30s, of medium build. He was wearing a dark hoodie, cargo pants and a grey baseball cap.</p> <p>One source with knowledge of the investigation said the suspect’s weapon had appeared to be a small flamethrower or canister of noxious spray meant to incapacitate anyone he came across.</p> <p>CCTV showed the burglar reaching for the weapon each time he heard a noise from those inside, the source said. At one point he came close to bumping into a maid.</p> <p>Police warned those trying to sell the stolen items that they were easily identifiable, and would not say if they believed the valuables could already be out of the country and for sale on the international hidden market.</p>    <p>DC Paulo Roberts, who is investigating the burglary, said: “This is a brazen offence, where the suspect has entered the property while armed with an unknown weapon and violated the sanctuary of the victims’ home.</p> <p>“The suspect has stolen £10.4m worth of jewellery, much of which is sentimental and unique in its design, and therefore easily identifiable.</p> <p>“We urge anyone who was in the area of Avenue Road, NW8, and saw anything suspicious to please come forward. Also, if you have seen this jewellery since, someone has offered to sell you it, or you have any further information, then please also contact the police or Crimestoppers anonymously.”</p> <p>Csaba Virag, the chief of staff to the family and who was in the mansion at the time, said the video footage showed the jewel thief “had definitely done it before”. </p> <p>Virag said that while the actual break-in looked like it was by a “lone wolf”, turning the stolen haul into money could involve a wider network.</p> <p>The family whose home was ransacked have offered a reward of up to £500,000 for information leading to the capture and conviction of the suspect. A second reward is on offer of 10% of the value of any items recovered.</p> <p>Avenue Road is one of Britain’s wealthiest addresses and home to scores of largely international billionaires and millionaires.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the insurers Aviva warned of a rise of over 40% in claims for high-end jewel thefts.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Novak Djokovic did not waste any time in producing a moment of magic. Flitting left of the tramlines in the first set of his 21st&nbsp;season as a professional, he bent a backhand slice between the net post and umpire’s chair for a spectacular, untouchable winner. It was the type of athleticism, resourcefulness and shotmaking that has made him the most successful player of all time.</p> <p>As a full, ebullient crowd under the lights at the Pat Rafter Arena in Brisbane responded, Djokovic’s celebration was even more unusual than the shot: the Serb sprinted across the court to embrace none other than Nick Kyrgios. For a long time, Djokovic and Kyrgios were only mentioned together when the Australian had fired another public, unprovoked insult towards him, yet here they stood as doubles partners on the same side of the net.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/30/katie-boulter-dreading-match-against-fiance-alex-de-minaur-in-united-cup-tennis\">Katie Boulter dreading match against fiance Alex de Minaur in United Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was an appetiser for a&nbsp;new season that, in one way or another, will be defined by how Djokovic performs. In 2024 he watched his last remaining great rivals, Rafael&nbsp;Nadal and&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;Murray, retire while his season was a complicated concoction of triumph and doubt. While Djokovic produced a legendary performance to seal an elusive Olympic gold medal, showing that he is still capable of performing at the highest level, the&nbsp;37-year-old spent the rest of the&nbsp;year chasing shadows. It was the first time since 2006, when he won his first two titles, that Djokovic failed to claim multiple titles in a season.</p> <p>His reaction to the difficulties of 2024 and the approach of Father Time has been fascinating. Last month Djokovic announced Murray as his new coach and the pair had 10 days working in Marbella after spending a large part&nbsp;of their lives trying to outsmart&nbsp;each other. Murray will&nbsp;join Djokovic in Melbourne at the Australian Open and they will try to hold off the younger&nbsp;generation for as long as&nbsp;they can.</p> <p>As Djokovic embraces his unfamiliar role as the hunter, Jannik Sinner will look to consolidate his status as the undisputed best men’s player in the world after producing one of the best seasons of the 21st century. Still, Sinner’s upcoming hearing at the court of arbitration for sport continues to loom over his on-court success after the World Anti-Doping Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/28/wada-seeks-long-ban-for-world-no-1-jannik-sinner-over-positive-drugs-test\">appealed against the no fault or negligence ruling</a> in his anti-doping case. The hearing will not take place before February and a ban for the Italian remains a possibility.</p> <p>Sinner’s sustained success should serve as motivation for others, none more so than Carlos Alcaraz. While he matched Sinner’s&nbsp;grand slam title count in 2024, winning Roland Garros and successfully defending his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/14/carlos-alcaraz-novak-djokovic-wimbledon-mens-singles-final-match-report\">Wimbledon</a> crown, Alcaraz was also punished throughout the year for his rash, incomposed performances.</p> <p>Three months after Sinner’s positive test was revealed, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Iga Swiatek announced she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/28/iga-swiatek-accepts-one-month-ban-testing-positive-trimetazidine-tennis\">had also failed an anti-doping test</a>. The Pole’s case, however, is relatively straightforward. After testing her medications and supplements, laboratory results showed her melatonin medication, a non-prescription regulated product in Poland and the rest of the EU, was contaminated with the banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ). The ITIA’s own tests confirmed this.</p>    <p>Although Swiatek has dominated the women’s game over the past three seasons, she has underachieved at grand slams outside of her remarkable performances at Roland Garros. Alongside her new coach, Wim Fissette, she will look to replicate her success at all of the biggest tournaments in 2025.</p> <p>Last season Aryna Sabalenka continued to grow as a player, harnessing her immense power into sustainable, consistent tennis and adding extra dimensions to her game. Her rivalry with Swiatek has already produced some excellent tennis, but the world’s top two are yet to meet in a grand slam final.</p> <p>The 2024 season concluded with a dramatic tussle in Riyadh as Coco Gauff, still only 20, won her first WTA Finals title, defeating both Swiatek and Sabalenka en route to the crown. Not only is Gauff in pursuit of a second grand slam title, her defeated opponent in the final, the 22-year-old Zheng Qinwen, has entered the fray.</p> <p>After her breakout Olympic gold medal, an&nbsp;Australian Open final and a brilliant second half of the season, Zheng will pursue a maiden grand slam title. Elena Rybakina will also&nbsp;look to re-establish herself after pulling off the boldest coaching hire on the WTA Tour by recruiting Goran Ivanisevic, Djokovic’s former&nbsp;coach.</p> <p>At the start of a new season, enjoyment was the common theme on Monday. As Djokovic smiled throughout, Kyrgios, playing only his second match since 2022 because of injury, threw in a successful tweener, dummied an underarm serve and navigated the entire evening without once talking down an official. They opened the first full week of the new season by narrowly defeating the German‑Austrian team of Andreas&nbsp;Mies and Alex Erler 6-4, 6-7 (7), 10-8. There will be more to come.</p>",

The group, he said, had an annual budget of $1.2bn (£0.95bn) and came dangerously close to strangling the Suez canal by its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen.</p> \n<p>He added that “millions of Israelis are waking up every night to the sound of sirens across the country”, accusing the Houthis of launching 300 attacks on Israel this year.</p> \n<p>He said: “Let me make one thing absolutely clear; we have had enough. Israel will not stand by and wait for the world to react. We will defend our citizens.” The Houthis were no longer a regional threat but a threat to the world order, he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/29/israel-orders-remaining-residents-of-beit-hanoun-to-leave\">Israel orders remaining residents of Beit Hanoun to leave</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While almost all security council members at Monday’s meeting condemned the Houthi attacks on Israel mounted a week ago, many also condemned the Israeli threat to Yemeni civilians represented by the air raids on key power stations, the air traffic control tower at the airport in the capital of Sana’a, and ports which are critical to the delivery of aid. Nine Yemeni civilians were killed in the attacks that Israel said were retaliation for what Danon described as “a relentless Houthi bombardment of Israeli population centres”.</p> \n<p>Barbara Woodward, the UK envoy to the UN, reiterated Israel’s right to self-defence but warned: “Israel’s action must be consistent with their obligations under international law including protection of civilians.”</p> \n<p>She said she was “concerned by the attack on Sana’a airport that endangered Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus”. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/27/israel-strike-yemen-sanaa-airport-world-health-organization-who-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\">at Sana’a airport when Israeli warplanes struck</a> on Thursday. A crew member from Tedros’s plane was injured in the strike and Tedros said he and his colleagues “escaped death narrowly”.</p> \n<p>“Humanitarian aid workers must be able to carry out their important work safely and securely,” said Woodward, adding the director general had been in Yemen to seek the release of a group of UN staff held hostage by the Houthis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"974e1585-ae94-478c-b69d-197d988954aa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yhhgrEvIcxs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Israel’s latest remarks appear to be part of a strategic decision to launch further decisive attacks on the Houthis, a strategy it hopes will be endorsed by the incoming Trump administration. Danon portrayed the UN as morally compromised and unwilling to take the steps necessary to enforce an arms embargo on Yemen.</p> \n<p>Israel wants the UN to interdict ships carrying Iranian weapons to the Houthis though ports such as Hodeidah. The US and the UK governments think the current weak mandate of the UN verification and inspection mechanism needs review.</p> \n<p>Referring to the narrow escape of the WHO director general and his delegation, Danon said: “We have no control over who is where. We have no intention to bomb to harm NGO or the UN, on the contrary, but if they are in areas where Houthis are, they should be careful because we will not sit idly by.”</p> \n<p>Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian ambassador to the UN, went further in criticising Israel, saying the attacks were not owing to self-defence, but “are part of military aggression against a sovereign state by the collective west”. He said it was irrelevant if the attack was regarded as retaliation since the scope of destruction was a deliberate escalation, and disproportionate. He accused the US and the UK of being involved in the attacks on civilian infrastructure.</p> \n<p>The Houthi leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, and the group’s spokesperson, Yahya Qasim Sare’e, have made it clear that as long as the war in Gaza continues, the Houthis will continue to attack shipping and Israel. Some Houthi activists have said on social media that recent attacks on Jaffa are a prelude to an attack on Israeli nuclear sites.</p>",

And today is one of such days: our team managed to bring 189 Ukrainians home,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a message posted on Telegram on Monday.</p> \n<p>The Russian defence ministry said 150 prisoners from each side had returned home, and there was no immediate explanation for the difference in numbers.</p> \n<p>Ukraine’s coordinating centre on exchanges said those returning to Ukraine included 87 soldiers from the army, 43 from the national guard, 33 border guards, 24 from the navy and two civilians.

This is our goal. We do not forget anyone,” Zelenskyy said.</p> \n<p>Returning prisoners have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/12/ukrainian-saxophonist-putin-torture-mariupol-siege\">told</a> the Guardian of physical and psychological brutality while in captivity, including repeated beatings, humiliating strip-searches, threatening interrogations and orders to sing the Russian national anthem or recite Russian poetry.</p> \n<p>Maria Klymyk, of the <a href=\"https://mipl.org.ua/en/\">Media Initiative for Human Rights</a> in Kyiv, whose organisation has conducted interviews with more than 100 returning prisoners, said many came home with injuries caused by malnourishment, neglect or abuse and some even needed amputations. “Almost everyone we have spoken to was tortured,” she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/continuing-plight-ukrainian-pows-family\">said</a> last year.</p> \n<p>Zelenskyy shared photographs of some of those exchanged on Monday, who were sitting on a coach and holding up Ukrainian flags. </p> \n<p>Russia’s human rights commissioner, Tatyana Moskalkova, published video of Russian soldiers gathered outside buses. “Very soon our guys will embrace their relatives and friends and celebrate the new year in their native land,” she wrote in a Telegram message accompanying the video.</p> \n<p>The exchange is a rare piece of good news for Ukraine as the country heads towards New Year’s Eve, when traditionally families gather together in one of the biggest holidays of the year in Ukraine and Russia.</p> \n<p>Kyiv is warily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/russia-and-ukraine-warily-wait-for-trump-transition-and-subsequent-peace-talks\">awaiting the return of Donald Trump to the White House</a>, and to see what his stated goal to bring a quick peace to the conflict will look like in practice. </p> \n<p>Some hope Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, may soon realise that Vladimir Putin has little interest in a deal and push for further military backing for Ukraine. Others fear Trump, given his longstanding admiration for the Russian president, may throw Ukraine under the bus.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Joe Biden’s administration announced nearly $6bn (£4.8bn) in military and budget aid for Ukraine, part of a rush to increase assistance before Trump takes over as president.</p> \n<p>“Today, I am proud to announce nearly $2.5bn in security assistance for Ukraine, as the Ukrainian people continue to defend their independence and freedom from Russian aggression,” Biden said in a statement. The package will allow the Pentagon to take weapons from US stocks and send them quickly to Ukraine.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the US Treasury announced $3.4bn in direct budgetary support for Ukraine.</p>",

Economists were worried enough to publicly warn her this month that liberalising financial sector regulations could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/16/economists-policy-experts-warn-rachel-reeves-city-deregulation\">undermine</a> the government’s efforts to grow the economy, posing “particular risks to the government’s wider industrial strategy”. They also stressed the importance of not forgetting the painful lessons of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">2008 global financial crisis</a>.</p> <p>The experts were responding to the chancellor’s November <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/mansion-house-2024-speech\">Mansion House</a> speech, in which Ms Reeves suggested that post-crisis regulations have “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/14/rules-imposed-after-financial-crisis-have-gone-too-far-reeves-tells-city-bankers\">gone too far</a>”. This is a troubling statement. Those rules were implemented to curb the sector’s excesses, prevent systemic risks and ensure that the Treasury does not have to bail out its failures. Rolling back such measures&nbsp;in the name of economic growth ignores the&nbsp;stability and protection they’ve provided.</p> <p>The crux of Ms Reeves’s argument is that expanding the sector will increase and broaden economic prosperity. History offers little support for such claims. The financial sector accounts for 9% of GDP, and the chancellor highlighted its success as the second-largest exporter of financial services in the G7. But it has done little to address the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.productivity.ac.uk/news/what-explains-the-uks-productivity-problem/#:~:text=From%202010%20to%202022%2C%20the,of%20improvement%20in%20recent%20years.&amp;amp;text=Low%20productivity%20levels%20seriously%20affect,especially%20at%20a%20regional%20level.\">stagnant productivity</a> or its chronic <a href=\"https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/uk-manufacturing-seen-chronic-underinvestment-labours-industrial-strategy-beacon-hope/indepth/article/1882705\">underinvestment</a>. Rather the sector’s rise has come at the expense of the “real economy” by siphoning off resources and talent.</p> <p>About a million people are employed in financial services. Compare that to roughly 20 million adults in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/approximatedsocialgradeenglandandwales/census2021\">classed</a> as manual workers, or the 15 million who work in low-paid, white-collar positions. In the squeezed bottom and middle, pay and social mobility are stagnant. It would be better to promote labour-intensive industries that have long been neglected.</p> <p>Instead of further deregulation, Britain’s financial sector should return to directing productive investment. Once a tool for economic development, the sector is increasingly detached from its original purpose. The thinktank Positive Money <a href=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/132494/1734021836-financial-services-growth-and-competitiveness-joint-response-1.pdf\">pointed</a> out that in 1960 the assets of UK banks were equivalent to 32% of GDP; by 2022 this figure had jumped to 563%. It highlighted international evidence that “too much finance is robustly found to harm growth”.</p> <p>The financialisation of the UK economy has contributed to inequality and instability. In housing, an asset bubble means average-priced English homes are affordable only to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/09/cost-of-buying-average-home-in-england-now-unaffordable-warns-ons\">richest 10%</a>. There is a danger to the wider economy when speculators ditch caution and chase higher risks. Insiders are sounding alarms. Sir John Kay’s 2015 book<a href=\"https://archive.ph/MzKHe\"> Other People’s Money</a> questioned the wisdom of a culture&nbsp;where morality and prudence are subordinate to personal profit. The Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/business/cutting-red-tape-could-attract-more-bad-actors-in-finance-sector-says-fca-boss-b2661917.html\">told</a> MPs in December that loosening the regulator’s remit will let more bad actors through.</p> <p>A few months earlier, the Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, had drawn on <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum\">Greek mythology</a> to make a point about the need to be vigilant over financial services’ excess. He thought the Trojan princess Cassandra, doomed to deliver true but ignored prophecies, might have made a good central banker. Her warnings, said Mr Bailey, chime with the economist Hyman Minsky’s view that memories of crises fade, only to be replaced by illusions of a “new era”. The global financial crisis of 2008 feels distant. But complacency is the real danger. If the chancellor refuses to learn from history, Britain is likely to suffer the same mistakes again.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Everett retells Mark Twain’s 1884 picaresque novel about a 13-year-old boy’s escapades on the Mississippi from the perspective of runaway slave Jim. Shocking, gripping and surprisingly comic, it’s a bravura performance that celebrates and subverts the original.</p> <p>Its success follows that of last year’s Women’s prize-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/16/barbara-kingsolver-rural-people-are-so-angry-they-want-to-blow-up-the-system\">Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver</a>, a dazzling 550-page updating of Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield transported to the author’s home region of Appalachia during the 1990s opioid epidemic. As the supreme chronicler of social injustice, Dickens provided Kingsolver with “a masterclass” in how to use narrative to make readers care about a latter-day&nbsp;underclass.</p> <p>This trend for repurposing canonical works continues into next year. Call Me Ishmaelle by the Chinese-British writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/10/xiaolu-guo-why-i-moved-from-beijing-to-london\">Xiaolu Guo</a> transforms the American behemoth Moby-Dick into a feminist adventure starring a cross-dressing female sailor. Guo describes her novel as “a homage to an American master, but with transgressive twists”. All three of these masters were white men. Dealing with issues of race, social injustice, gender and our relationship with nature, each of these reimaginings of 19th-century novels gives a new slant&nbsp;on the contemporary American crisis.</p> <p>As well as being one of the most significant novels in American literature – “the best book we’ve had”, according to Hemingway – Huckleberry Finn has also been one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/24/100-best-novels-huckleberry-finn-twain\">most controversial</a> and most banned. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8239737/Censored-Huckleberry-Finn-prompts-political-correctness-debate.html\">A new edition</a> with racist terms removed was published in 2011. The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12126700\">New York Times complained</a> that “there is no way to ‘clean up’ Twain without doing irreparable harm to the truth of his work”. Recent edited versions of novels by<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/03/25/agatha-christie-classics-latest-rewritten-modern-sensitivities/\"> Roald Dahl, Agatha Christie and Ian Fleming</a> have met with similar accusations of censorship.</p> <p>Rewriting, rather than simply removing offensive language or storylines, confronts problematic texts. By changing the perspective of a novel, marginalised figures can be turned into the heroes of their own lives, to paraphrase the opening line of David Copperfield. Everett rescues James from the racial stereotypes of Twain’s original, giving him back his proper name, depth of character and literacy. “With my pencil I wrote myself into being,” James says.</p> <p>From Jean Rhys’s landmark postcolonial and feminist prequel to Jane Eyre, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/15/book-beach-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\">Wide Sargasso Sea</a>, in 1966 to Sandra Newman’s Julia, a powerful retelling of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four published last year, overlooked female characters are also being written into existence. Unsurprisingly, ancient myths have proved fertile territory for female-led reboots, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/03/theatre.margaretatwood\">Margaret Atwood</a>, Pat Barker and Madeleine Miller all going behind the battle lines of the Odyssey and the Iliad.</p> <p>None of this is new. Shakespeare drew heavily on classical stories (Romeo and Juliet is based on Ovid’s tale of Pyramus and Thisbe). In turn, there are no end of Shakespeare-inspired offshoots. All storytelling is retelling. Returning to old books is not a failure of invention, but a way of keeping the canon alive. Whether the contemporary authors stick faithfully to the plot line (as Kingsolver does) or play fast and loose with the original (like Everett), they breathe fresh life into much-loved characters and stories. At their best, reworkings like James and Demon Copperhead are future classics in their own right.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>New government data published on Monday showed that 95% of non-recycled waste in Essex is sent to landfill, as ministers launched their plans for a circular economy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residual-waste-infrastructure-capacity-note/residual-waste-infrastructure-capacity-note\">The data</a> revealed that seven local authorities in England reported sending more than 40% of their residual waste to landfill in 2022 to 2023, with Essex county council at the top of the list.</p> <p>Next came Cambridgeshire county council, (87% of waste sent to landfill), Southend borough council (74%), Darlington borough council (61%), Lancashire county council<strong> </strong>(59%), Leicester city council (57%) and Newcastle upon Tyne city council (56%).</p> <p>At present, non-recyclable waste is either incinerated for energy or sent to landfill.</p> <p>But as the population grows, the way packaging is used and made needs to change in order to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill. This includes making it more recyclable and using less of it.</p> <p>Ministers<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-crack-down-on-waste-incinerators-with-stricter-standards-for-new-builds\"> have announced</a> a suite of plans to encourage a circular economy, including simpler recycling in England, so that less waste is sent to landfill or incinerated.</p> <p>Other plans include a deposit returns scheme for plastic bottles, and charging manufacturers for producing too much waste using a “polluter pays” principle. This would incentivise producers to sell products in recycled and recyclable packaging.</p>    <p>In July, government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/circular-economy-measures-drive-forward-ambitious-plans-for-waste\">targets were set</a> which would require local authorities to send, on average, no more than 10% of municipal waste to landfill by 2035.</p> <p>On Monday, as part of the circular economy strategy, a plan was announced to crack down on new incinerators and incentivise recycling instead. Almost half of all waste (49%) collected by local authorities in 2022-23 was incinerated, with just 40% recycled.</p> <p>But the plans come against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/26/recycling-rate-falls-in-uk-as-just-44-of-household-waste-is-recycled\">falling recycling rates</a>, according to the latest data. In 2021, the household recycling rate was 44.1%, falling to 43.4% in 2022.</p> <p>The new strategy will make it harder to get planning permission for incinerators. In order to build them, developers will have to demonstrate that their projects help lower the amount of non-recyclable waste sent to landfill or enable the replacement of older, less efficient plants. </p> <p>Developers will also need to ensure new projects are built carbon-capture ready, once the requirements come into force, and show how they will make use of the heat they produce, which could be used to decarbonise other sectors. Incineration facilities provide about 3% of the UK’s energy generation.</p> <p>The circular economy minister, Mary Creagh, said: “For far too long, the nation has seen its recycling rates stagnate and has relied on burning household waste, rather than supporting communities to keep resources in use for longer. <br><br>“That ends today, with clear conditions for new energy from waste plants – they must be efficient and support net zero and our economic growth mission, before they can get the backing needed to be built. <br><br>“This is another vital step on the pathway to a circular economy, where we reduce waste to landfill and boost the economy, while also ensuring those facilities maximise the benefits to communities. This will also help us deliver on our Plan for Change in a decade of national renewal.”</p> <p>Charlotte Rule, head of climate and energy policy at the Environmental Services Association, added: “Recovering energy and materials from waste left over after recycling is an important part of a circular economy but development of energy-from-waste (EfW) facilities must be carefully balanced against current and future capacity needs, which this new residual waste infrastructure capacity note supports.</p> <p>“Increasing recycling rates, and developing carbon capture as well as district heat networks across the UK’s EfW fleet, will all play a role supporting our sector’s target to decarbonise by 2040 and contribute to UK net zero goals, so we welcome government’s support in these areas.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Lancashire county council said: “59% of our waste is currently sent to landfill as a result of a long-term contractual commitment, but this will reduce significantly in 2025-26 and almost entirely in 2026-27 upon expiry of the contract.</p> <p>“From April 2025, a significant proportion of waste that has been going to landfill will be recovered through thermal treatment processes instead.</p> <p>“From April 2026, the only waste that will be sent to landfill is that which can’t be treated through any other process, which we expect to be a very small percentage.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Essex county council said: “These figures cover 2022 to 2023 and represent waste that cannot be recycled, reused or composted, which is about 50% of all waste in Essex.</p> <p>“Since then, we have awarded new waste disposal contracts, which means the use of landfill for non-recyclable waste collected by local authorities in Essex is projected to end by October 2025. In 2022 to 2023, almost half of waste collected by Essex councils was reused, recycled or composted and therefore did not go to landfill.</p> <p>The recently adopted Waste Strategy for Essex commits the council to ceasing the use of landfill and sets an ambition of recycling at least 70% of waste. This is five years earlier than our strategy commitment and exceeds the government target to divert at least 90% of waste from landfill by 2035.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire county council said: “Our first priority is to reduce, re-use and to recycle as much as possible, as there are limited methods available to treat the waste that is left over in the short-medium term.</p> <p>“We are actively working with both our waste contractor, as well as Central Government, to try and find the best long-term solution to manage the county’s waste.”</p> <p>Local authorities in Southend, Darlington, Leicester and Newcastle upon Tyne were also contacted for comment.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 31 December 2024 to include comments from Essex county council and Cambridgeshire county council.</p>",

He doesn’t need the dollars.”</p> <p>A diverse range of critics, including a former White House ethics lawyer, a senior Republican strategist, and Democratic politicians, <a href=\"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/chris-sununus-hot-elon-musk-085948979.html\">assailed Sununu over his comments</a> – a backlash that continued to escalate in a scathing column by the political author and MSNBC producer Steve Benen.</p> <p>“Let me see if I have this straight … Americans shouldn’t be overly concerned about the president-elect empowering a billionaire GOP megadonor with power and influence, a businessman with extensive private-sector interests here and abroad, and we should be indifferent to the potential for the megadonor’s conflicts of interest?” <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/problems-sununus-line-musks-alleged-conflicts-interest-rcna185737\">Benen wrote</a>.</p> <p>“Why? Because, according to Sununu, ‘everyone’ has conflicts of interest, and the world’s wealthiest person isn’t overly concerned about making money?”</p> <p>Benen said Sununu, who was excoriated repeatedly by Trump for backing Nikki Haley during the Republican presidential primary, and who had previously described Trump as “fucking crazy” in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/republican-governor-chris-sununu-trump-crazy-washington-roast\">2022 Washington roast</a>, had “tried and failed” to address the potential conflicts of interest surrounding Musk ahead of the president-elect’s 20 January inauguration.</p> <p>“Sununu found himself in the unenviable role of trying to defend the indefensible in order to bolster the man who’d spent the year mocking and scolding him,” he wrote.</p> <p>Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer during the administration of George W Bush, called Sununu’s comments “bull” in a post to X, the social media platform owned by Musk.</p> <p>“Is this the new normal? Billionaires are too rich to have conflicts of interest?” <a href=\"https://x.com/RWPUSA/status/1873442055084712448\">he also wrote</a>.</p> <p>David Meuse, a Democratic New Hampshire state representative, also criticized Sununu’s position. “According to<a href=\"https://x.com/GovChrisSununu\"> [the governor], </a>if you happen to be the world’s wealthiest biological organism, your motives can no longer be questioned – even if you donated $277m in campaign contributions to Trump and other GOP pols to secure your seat at the table,” he said <a href=\"https://x.com/JdmMeuse/status/1873458675136020888\">in an X post</a>.</p> <p>Jeff Timmer, a Republican strategist and advisor to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, said <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftimmer/status/1873418614356996277\">in his own post</a>: “Sununu has learned that once you jettison all honor and integrity by digging a hole of relativism you might as well keep digging.”</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/elon-musk-conflict-of-interest\">analysis by the Guardian</a> earlier in December revealed that Musk has a wider and deeper range of potential conflicts of interest with the federal government than perhaps any person before him.</p> <p>With his various companies already benefiting from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/business/elon-musk-wealth-government-help/index.html\">tens of billions of dollars in federal funding</a>, Musk stands to enrich himself and his interests even further as head of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) advisory committee. Those companies could also benefit from looser government regulations while Musk oversees a financial clampdown on spending elsewhere.</p> <p>Trump has utilized Musk as one of his closest advisers since the election, claiming <a href=\"https://time.com/7201887/trump-person-of-the-year-elon-musk/\">in a Time interview</a> that “Elon puts the country long before his company”. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/28/trump-musk-h1b-visas\">sided with</a> Musk again at the weekend in an immigration dispute with conservative hardliners over visas for foreign tech workers.</p> <p>Economic analysts have criticized Musk’s appointment – and say the incoming Trump administration’s plans for sweeping tax cuts combined with massive federal job losses suggest “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/donald-trump-tax-cuts-elon-musk-doge-us-debt\">they have no idea what they are doing</a>”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It is difficult to comprehend why the Anglican Church allowed known abusers into positions of trust, and continued to tolerate situations that should have been impossible (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/25/c-of-e-must-kneel-in-penitence-after-difficult-year-says-archbishop-of-york\">C of E must ‘kneel in penitence’ after difficult year, says archbishop of York, 25 December</a>).</p> <p>A church has no knees but those of its members, most of whom, in this case, were surely oblivious of the situation. That the archbishop of York chose to use figurative language at such a portentous moment offers a small clue to the problem. Why did Stephen Cottrell need an adviser to tell him that a known abuser should not hold any office in the church? What is the point of high office in the church if its holders cannot act in favour of victims and against perpetrators?</p> <p>The Anglican church into which I was baptised as a helpless baby and confirmed as an ignorant teenager has had much to commend it over the centuries. The Church in Wales was “separated and disestablished”<em> </em>in 1914, and I wish that the Church of England had taken a corresponding decision later in the 20th century.</p> <p>Arguably, this would have been better for the church. It would certainly be better for the UK constitution now to separate itself, the electorate and the public from an organisation that is so pitiably unable to manage its affairs. I doubt that a great hierarchical institution can really “demonstrate the power of love”. But such an organisation&nbsp;can, and surely should, demonstrate the significance of timely, appropriate action.<br><strong>Janet Dubé</strong><br><em>Peebles, Scottish Borders</em></p> <p>• It’s taken me a lifetime to realise that the physical invasion and abuse I received as a teenager by a priest of the Church of England, and the rapes by his friends, and the acceptance of such behaviour by this unaccountable priest, was exactly that – rape and abuse. </p> <p>Nothing protected you in the 1960s. I doubt if the bishops at the time could imagine what went on, though such ignorance or naivety didn’t prevent others in the town being suspicious. My mother challenged this priest on account of the rumours, but who else could she turn to? Turn a blind eye, was the attitude of many in the church.</p> <p>The religious nonsense of this priest and his nomenclature, “Father”, protected him. His outburst in a sermon that “we were all drains and came to mass for divine disinfectant” went unchallenged, projecting his unresolved guilt on to young minds. It just seems laughable today; at the time it was dangerous.</p> <p>The bishop of Newcastle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/16/archbishop-of-york-stephen-cottrell-faces-calls-to-resign-over-handling-of-sexual-abuse-case\">made it plain</a>: “there was a “generation of bishops in the C of E” who were “very much in the mould of it being an old boys’ club”. My priest died unchallenged, unrepentant, full of&nbsp;pride in his religious gobbledegook, his shield from shame at invading young vulnerable lives, their minds&nbsp;and bodies.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• About 15 years ago, I attended a safeguarding symposium where the emphasis was on sharing best practice when working with vulnerable children and adults, and how best to have effective safeguarding policies and structures within organisations.</p> <p>Several Church of England parish groups were present. During the day, members of these groups talked about the church “reaching out” to support other organisations. At the plenary meeting I referenced these comments, and wondered to the audience if the C of E ever allowed other organisations to “reach in” to see how it operated and offer appropriate feedback. This was met with blank incomprehension by church members, although one approached me afterwards to say I’d given him something to think about.</p> <p>The Church of England has resisted any meaningful examination of how it operates, and is an example that it’s not enough to have policies and procedures – there have to be effective actions.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

This is perhaps reflected in the lack of diversity of psychedelic clinical trial participants. Although this is a problem across clinical research as a whole, it is more of a concern for psychedelic trials as the psychedelic experience is very culturally specific.</p> <p>Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the difficulties of obtaining informed consent for psychedelic experiences in the clinical setting. Positive clinical outcomes for psilocybin-assisted therapy have been linked to generating what is termed a “mystical experience”. One of the core features of a mystical experience is that it is ineffable. If I as a clinician cannot put the experience into words, then how can my patients give informed&nbsp;consent that meets the robust medico-legal standard?</p> <p>We must also question how much follow-up integration therapy will be offered in resource-driven mental health services, should psilocybin become a licensed treatment. Any model that focuses on preparation and support during the experience, rather than longer-term integration, will&nbsp;leave questions around where patients are to turn should they need additional support following a&nbsp;challenging experience.</p> <p>It is still not certain that psilocybin will become a licensed psychiatric treatment and, as trials progress, it is important that the above issues with psilocybin in the clinical setting&nbsp;are&nbsp;robustly addressed.<br><strong>Dr Caroline Hayes</strong><br><em>Newcastle-upon-Tyne</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

On an underlying basis, profit was up from $31m to just under $37m.</p> <p>DRJB Holdings comprises three divisions, the largest of which is DB Ventures Limited, housing most of his commercial partnerships with brands such as Nespresso.</p> <p>Profits in DB Ventures rose by 18% to $37.5m, according to figures released by the company, which did not identify the measure of earning it was using.</p> <p>Another division, Seven Global LLP, contains deals that fall outside the DB Ventures business, including partnerships with Adidas and Safilo, the company that distributes his DB Eyewear brand. Its profits fell from $11.9m to $10.9m.</p> <p>The remainder of the business is Studio 99, the production studio that made the Netflix documentary Beckham, which ranked in the streaming service’s top 10 shows in all 90 countries where it was released.</p> <p>However, while revenues from Studio 99 rose to $15m, results for the combined group indicated the production company lost money, despite the success of the Beckham documentary and a series about the snooker player Ronnie O’Sullivan.</p> <p>Full results for the group have not yet been filed at Companies House.

Belgian prosecutors said the criminals would film the sexual assaults and use the footage to blackmail the victims into criminality and further sexual abuse.</p> <p>The three men were detained in south London, Hertfordshire and Essex after warrants were issued for their arrest by Belgian courts.</p> <p>Ziarmal Khan, also known as Boxer Bhai, 24, was arrested in Essex on 6 December. Specialist NCA extradition officers then arrested Zeeshan Banghis, also known as Bangash Zeeshan, 20, at a New Kent Road address on 18 December, and Saifur Rahman Ahmedzai, also known as Raees Hamza, 23, at an address in Hemel Hempstead on Monday.</p> <p>According to Belgian prosecutors, the gang was involved in organising the transport of people from Afghanistan through Iran, Turkey and the Balkans into western Europe, mainly Belgium and France, from where many would be put on small boats to the UK.</p> <p>Last month a court in Antwerp convicted 23 members of the gang, 11 of whom were tried in their absence. The NCA supported Belgian authorities to build evidence against the group, who were handed sentences ranging from two to 18 years in prison.<br><br>Ahmedzai was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment, while Khan and Banghis were each sentenced to three years. All three were also fined €3,000 (£2,486). They now face being extradited to Belgium to serve their sentences.</p> <p>“This operation shows that no matter where people-smuggling gangs operate, we will find them and bring them to justice,” the NCA’s deputy director, Craig Turner, said, adding that the agency “will not stop in our work to disrupt and dismantle the gangs that are behind these horrendous crimes”.</p> <p>The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “This case is nothing short of sickening. These men ran extensive illegal smuggling operations and inflicted extreme cruelty on the migrants they smuggled – some of them children – when they were at their most vulnerable.</p> <p>“I am grateful to the NCA, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement officers, for their hard work and dedication in pursuing these vile criminal gangs, safeguarding victims of exploitation and protecting our borders.”</p>",

Turnover fell slightly to £6m, down from £6.2m, amid “consumer and corporate hesitancy”, according to <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11100473/filing-history\">accounts filed with Companies House</a>.</p> <p>The improved financial performance resulted from streamlining its live events programme, reducing its editorial and production workforce and offering voluntary redundancy, the company said. The number of staff working in editorial and production fell to 44, down from 52, administrative and support staff reduced to six from eight people, and commercial staff rose to 14 from 12.</p> <p>Tortoise was launched in 2019 by James Harding, a former editor of the Times and former director of news at the BBC, and Matthew Barzun, a former US ambassador to the UK.</p> <p>Tortoise said 2023 was a “challenging year for consumers and as a result the competition for news and information subscriptions were hard fought” with alternative sources posing a “significant threat to quality journalism”. It said its mixed business model meant it was “well placed to adjust to changes in consumer behaviour”.</p> <p>Tortoise said it incurred one-off redundancy costs of almost £520,000 in 2023. It also made share awards to high-performing employees totalling £321,545. Directors’ total remuneration, including pension contribution, fell to £416,000 from £598,000.</p> <p>The company said it reported cumulative losses of £20.3m, which could be offset against future profits to reduce its tax bill. </p> <p>This year, it raised £2.7m by issuing shares and convertible loan notes and secured further equity funding to support the acquisition of the Observer, it added.</p> <p>Tortoise said it would invest £25m and “combine its digital newsroom with that of the world’s oldest Sunday newspaper, adding significant new editorial resources to the paper on a Sunday and building a daily digital Observer that includes podcasts, video, newsletters and a new website”.</p> <p>The first Observer under Tortoise ownership is expected be published in the spring.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust-board\">Scott Trust</a>, the ultimate owner of the Guardian and Observer, announced earlier this month that a deal to sell the Observer to Tortoise had been agreed in principle. The trust is investing £5m in Tortoise Media and taking a 9% stake in the business. It will also take a seat on the editorial and commercial boards of the media company.</p> <p>Journalists at the Guardian and Observer who are members of the National Union of Journalists went on strike for four days spread out over two weeks over the proposed deal, which they fear could lead to job losses and affect the Observer’s editorial independence.</p> <p>Staff have been told there will be no job losses as a result of the deal. Observer staff have been told they can also opt to take voluntary redundancy on enhanced terms. If they transfer to Tortoise, their existing terms and conditions will be honoured.</p> <p>Tortoise said it broke even in the fourth quarter of 2023, adding that it accepted revenue last year would stay roughly flat year on year after dropping some lower-profit events.</p>",

His 1976 presidential run, he later said, was helped by the band, which raised $64,000 for his indebted campaign, allowing Carter to double that with matching government funds.</p> <p>“Gregg Allman and the Allman Brothers just about put me in the White House,” Carter said in 2015.</p> <p>After his death was announced on Sunday, musicians remembered Carter in posts on social media.</p> <p>“President Jimmy Carter was a truly extraordinary man and a rare politician who always stood up and spoke out for idealism, compassion and human rights and particularly for the rights of women and those who suffered real oppression,” <a href=\"https://x.com/itspetergabriel/status/1873520930770547181\">wrote Peter Gabriel</a>, a longtime friend to Carter.</p> <p>“Rest easy, Mr President. I’m sad for us, and happy for you. Your and Mrs. Rosalynn’s legacy of love will live forever,” <a href=\"https://x.com/trishayearwood/status/1873506515690442804\">wrote the country singer Trisha Yearwood</a>. Yearwood and her husband, fellow country singer Garth Brooks, helped lead the 2024 Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project with Habitat for Humanity.</p> <p>In a statement, the <a href=\"https://x.com/ACMawards/status/1873499559030300911\">Academy of Country Music (ACM) quoted Carter</a> as having said: “Country music is heard everywhere. It is the deepest expression of all that is uniquely American.” He had written those sentiments in regards to the 15th annual ACM awards in 1980.</p> <p>The ACM’s statement on Sunday read: “On behalf of everyone at the Academy, thank you for your service to others and love for [country music].”</p> <p>Heart’s vocalist Nancy Wilson called Carter “an incredible bridge between policy and our humanity”. And the actor Jamie Lee Curtis wrote a brief tribute on Instagram that said: “Thank you for teaching us all how to be humans Mr. President.”</p> <p>The rapper Killer Mike, who was born in Carter’s home state of Georgia, <a href=\"https://x.com/KillerMike/status/1873483826519024026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873483826519024026%7Ctwgr%5E51c34a8f766d6bb4d17ca3d5ed59249014d3c73b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2024%2F12%2Fjimmy-carter-tributes-hollywood-politics-1236243403%2F\">posted</a> to X: “I am honored to say I have known a ‘Good Man’ who truly made a difference in a wicked world.”</p> <p>But Carter’s contribution to the arts, said Stuart E Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser from 1977 to 1981, made him “as close to a Renaissance man as we’ve had in the White House in modern times”.</p> <p>In 1978, Carter opened the east wing of the National Gallery of Art, designed by architect IM Pei, at the base of the US Capitol.</p> <p>“We have no ministry of culture in this country, and I hope we never will. We have no official art in this country, and I pray that we never will,” Carter declared at the opening. “No matter how democratic a government may be, no matter how responsive to the wishes of its people, it can never be government’s role to define exactly what is good, or true or beautiful. Instead, government should limit itself to nourishing the ground in which art and the love of art can grow.”</p> <p>During the Carter administration, Congress doubled the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). But his liberal standing on expression also contributed to backlash.</p> <p>The Christian evangelical leader Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979 to weaponize resentment among southern evangelicals who had voted Carter, the first “born-again”, into office, and who voted him out again four years later.</p> <p>Carter won countercultural credibility when the gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson wrote about his successful 1976 campaign against Gerald Ford. Thompson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SLeFZFTIco&amp;t=247s\">said</a> he had never heard “a sustained piece of political oratory that impressed me more” than an address Carter made in 1974 that he called “a king-hell bastard of a speech”.</p> <p>Carter reportedly caught Thompson’s attention when he cited the musician Bob Dylan for his understanding about what was right and wrong, pointing to Dylan’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgphPFNiVZw\">Maggie’s Farm</a>, among others. <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-the-us-president-and-renaissance-man-who-believed-in-art-and-rock-and-roll-has-died-aged-100\">According to the Art Newspaper</a>, Carter counselled Dylan when he considered converting to Christianity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/30/jimmy-carter-foreign-policy-\">From Panama to Palestine, Jimmy Carter refused to let his moral voice be silenced</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the visual arts realm, Andy Warhol travelled to Carter’s home in tiny Plains, Georgia, in 1977 and made three portraits, <a href=\"https://revolverwarholgallery.com/portfolio/jimmy-carter-150/\">including Jimmy Carter I,</a> a photo-collage that the Carter campaign sold as a series of 50 $1,000 prints.</p> <p>The Carter family, Warhol later recalled, “were very normal. We got along very well … Jimmy Carter gave me two big bags of peanuts which he signed. That made the whole trip worthwhile.”</p> <p>Robert Rauschenberg also contributed to Carter’s Inaugural Impressions, a portfolio that included representations by Roy Lichtenstein and Jamie Wyeth.</p> <p>But Carter was a painter in his own right, with a package of his old art tools and a print he made bringing in $1m at an auction to benefit the Carter Center in Atlanta, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-news/top-item-at-fundraiser-1-million-for-jimmy-carters-old-art-tools-print/JYCO475VYRA7TPXX2FA2LO45Q4/#:~:text=The%20winning%20bidder%20paid%20$1%20million%20for,painted%20of%20the%20Carter%20Center%20and%20gardens.\">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 31 December 2024.

            "body" : "<p>My friend Don Fairservice, who has died aged 92, was a creative film editor and film-maker. Active in his youth as an actor and set designer with the Mountview Theatre Club in London, he became fascinated by the details of making films, their structures and meanings, and this led to a long career as a editor for the BBC and with numerous directors.</p> <p>Don edited more than 40 films and TV series, and won a Bafta in 1989 for the Channel 4 series A Very British Coup. Other editing projects included Me and Mrs Jones (2002), The Railway Children (2000), The Scarlet Tunic (1998), Emma (1996), Beautiful Thing (1996), The Hanging Gale (1995) and Chattahoochee (1989).</p> <p>He wrote and directed a 60-minute film adaptation of Beowulf in 1972, and directed an episode in 1969 for the factual series Cameron Country, featuring the journalist James Cameron, and made several other films, including the documentaries <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqKne6mcWuI\">Japanese Journey</a> (2008) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsV0mR_4mk\">Some Views of New Delhi</a> (2010), for which I composed the scores.</p> <p>In 2001 he published <a href=\"https://manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780719057779/\">Film Editing: History, Theory and Practice</a>, “explaining the ‘how’ and especially the ‘why’ of film editing”, as he described it. His knowledge of film history is clear in the book, as is his passion for silent films. He later produced an accompanying three-DVD set, featuring excerpts from more than 70 silent and sound films, with the silents accompanied by the pianist John Sweeney.</p> <p>Don was born in Friern Barnet, north London, the only child of Lily (nee Montague) and Walter Fairservice, who worked for Gordon &amp; Gotch book distributors. He went to Hornsey county school, and then worked as a clerical assistant (with national service in 1951-53) while acting in amateur drama societies, including 13 years with Mountview. There, in 1961, he made his first documentary film and successfully applied to be a trainee film editor at BBC Television, where he was on staff until 1982, thereafter working as a freelance editor and film-maker until 2012.</p> <p>During the 1970s he taught at the National Film and Television School and at what is now the Northern Film School in Leeds. In later life he lived in Bristol, where projects included editing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/20/richard-williams-obituary\">Richard Williams</a>’s and Imogen Sutton’s 16-DVD set <a href=\"http://www.theanimatorssurvivalkit.com/\">The Animator’s Survival Kit</a> in 2008, and involvement over many years with Chris Daniels to curate silent film events and short films for the annual Slapstick festival. He generously assisted friends and university students with film-making and editing.</p> <p>In 2015 Don completed a book entitled The Hitchcock Paradox, though it was never published. The premise was that Alfred Hitchcock “went out of his way to construct his own mythology as a genius with total control over every aspect of his films” without deviating from scripts, but in fact – as Don was able to demonstrate after studying original scripts for Notorious, Marnie, Psycho and other films – Hitchcock created as he went along, often altering the scripted version, including camera shots, along with significant reshoots.</p> <p>Don married Rosalind Ward in 1962, and they divorced in 1967. His marriage in 1988 to Amanda Hollyer ended in divorce 20 years later. He is survived by Kate, his daughter from a relationship with Pamela Hicks, and a granddaughter, Ellen.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It is the zebra-striped tag that has become ubiquitous over the last 50 years, but the barcode’s days could be numbered. The global organisation overseeing their use has said a more powerful alternative will be readable by retailers everywhere within two years.</p> <p>New codes that contain sell-by dates, product instructions, allergens and ingredients, as well as prices, will mean “we will say goodbye to the old-fashioned barcode”, according to GS1, an international non-profit that maintains the global standard for barcodes.</p> <p>Tesco has started using them on some products, and other trials have suggested that waste of perishable food such as poultry can be cut by embedding sell-by dates in the new QR-style codes, allowing for more dynamic discounting.</p> <p>QR (quick response) codes will allow customers to instantly access more information about the product, including how to recycle batteries, clothes and building materials when tougher environmental regulations bite.</p> <p>But they will also put a greater demand on the world’s cloud computing resources, where the extra data they contain will be stored – meaning a potentially greater carbon footprint.</p> <p>The first barcode was read in an Ohio supermarket in June 1974 when a packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum was rung up. It was devised by Joe Woodland, an inventor who had been implored by a retailer frustrated at losing profits, to speed up checkout queues and stocktaking.</p> <p>Coca-Cola has <a href=\"https://www.gs1.org/insights-events/case-studies/case-studies/coca-colas-reusable-refillable-bottles-benefit-innovative-qr-codes\">used</a> the new generation of codes in parts of Latin America for refillable bottles, with the QR code allowing the counting of refills so that a requirement of 25 before recycling can be enforced. The Australian supermarket chain Woolworths is said to have <a href=\"https://www.gs1uk.org/insights/news/WoolworthsAustralia-reducing-waste-and-boosting-productivity-with-2D-barcodes\">reduced food waste</a> by up to 40% in some areas, as the codes allow stores to better spot products approaching expiry and discount more efficiently.</p> <p>“We’ve defined an ambition that by the end of 2027 all retailers in the world will be able to read those next-generation barcodes,” said Renaud de Barbuat, the president and chief executive of GS1. “We think it’s doable … It represents some investment on the part of retailers to adapt their point-of-sale systems, but it’s already well under way.”</p> <p>Some experts believe reports of the demise of the picket fence-style barcode are premature, pointing out that there is less need for the new codes on non-food products without sell-by dates and that there is a cost to redesigning packaging.</p> <p>In the UK, close to half of retailers have already upgraded their checkout technology to accommodate more multifunctional QR codes, and most of the remainder are expected to do so over the coming year, according to a survey by GS1 UK.</p> <p>Anne Godfrey, the chief executive of GS1 UK, said: “This has been in the works for some time, but Covid really accelerated it. During the pandemic, everyone got used to pointing their phones at QR codes in pubs and restaurants to access the menu.”</p> <p>Steven Gibbons, head of sales at Electronic Reading Systems, said: “I think that barcodes being a thing of the past is not the case yet because not everyone needs to conform [to using the new QR codes].”</p> <p>Items such as candles, which do not have a sell-by date, could continue to use the old-fashioned barcodes, while perishable food could benefit from having extra data including use-by and source.</p> <p>He said barcodes would also persist in warehousing and manufacturing, where they are a key part of long-established processes.</p> <p>The new QR codes have the advantage of containing their information in several places in the image, which means that little crumples on packaging do not prevent them from being read by scanners. If a rumpled packet means a single bar of a picket fence-style barcode is missing, a reader is not able to register it.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The 11-year religious dictatorship of General Zia-ul-Haq profoundly shaped the art of Pakistan. After the general’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/11/pakistan-sharia-law-general-zia-1977\">successful coup in 1977</a>, his regime ushered in martial law, trampled on women’s rights, enforced strict censorship and placed draconian restrictions on artistic expression.</p> <p>Ascent of Man, an abstract painting by Quddus Mirza, is inspired by the controversial trial and hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the democratically elected prime minister overthrown by the coup. The painting, part of <a href=\"https://nmoq.org.qa/en/calendar/manzar-exhibition/\">a groundbreaking exhibition</a> of Pakistan’s art and architecture, depicts a man sitting in a chair while a headless body floats in the sky. It blends elements of magic realism with an allusion to the seventh-century martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, a grandson of the prophet Muhammad whose death was a major episode in Islam’s history that still resonates today.</p> <p>“Under Zia-ul-Haq,<strong> </strong>artists, playwrights and novelists found a way to subvert,” says Mirza, whose works are among 200 featured in the exhibition, titled <a href=\"https://nmoq.org.qa/en/calendar/manzar-exhibition/\">Manzar: Art and Architecture from Pakistan, 1940s to Today</a>. “It was a turning point – that subversive language changed the art of Pakistan for good.”</p>    <p>Hosted by the National Museum of Qatar in Doha, the show highlights the connection between Pakistan’s cultural heritage and contemporary practices, while connecting it to broader global artistic and architectural movements. <em>Manzar</em> is an Arabic and Urdu word meaning “scene”, “view” or “perspective” – a reference used to underscore the diversity of the exhibition. The exhibition is organised by the forthcoming <a href=\"https://qm.org.qa/en/stories/all-stories/art-mill-museum-a-museum-for-the-21st-century/\">Art Mill Museum (AMM)</a>, a showcase of modern and contemporary art due to open in Doha “in a few years’ time”. </p> <p>From art coinciding with the time of the partition of India in 1947, such as the works of leading painters <a href=\"https://thekarachicollective.com/interface-with-creative-conversations-a-re-reading-of-ustad-allah-baksh/\">Ustad Allah Bakhsh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.grosvenorgallery.com/artists/52-abdur-rahman-chughtai/overview/\">Abdur Rahman Chughtai</a>, to the neo-miniature paintings of <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/artists/shahzia-sikander\">Shahzia Sikander</a> and <a href=\"https://ropac.net/artists/71-imran-qureshi/\">Imran Qureshi</a>, calligraphic modernism by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/art/2024/portraits/syed-sadequain\">Sadequain</a>, and the feminist art of <a href=\"https://awarewomenartists.com/en/artiste/salima-hashmi/\">Salima Hashmi</a>, the exhibition features artworks spanning eight decades. </p> <p>Mirza says General Zia-ul-Haq’s era ultimately led to the establishment of the neo-miniature and Karachi Pop movements. He says the exhibition is unique in including pre-1947 works as well as those from neighbouring India and works from Bangladesh prior to 1971. Curators Caroline Hancock, Aurélien Lemonier and Zarmeene Shah have used political posters, magazines, film ads and examples of popular culture to bring context to the exhibition, and also show “architecture and art side by side”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In Pakistan, there is confusion about our identity. But this has positively added to the diversity of art</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mirza is critical of the term “Pakistani art”, because he believe the roots of the region’s artistic legacy “are far deeper and more inclusive” than to the land carved in 1947, when Pakistan was created. “In Pakistan, we have always been trying to find our identity,” the artist says. “For some it is being south Asian, for others it is being Muslim, which means that we are not really clear about our identity. There is a confusion and a question. But this has positively added into the diversity of art from Pakistan. There is a great mix.”</p>    <p>The exhibition delves into artistic movements including the Mughal-inspired miniature tradition, modernist innovations and contemporary experiments in neo-miniature art. Some of the works exhibited have never before been loaned or seen outside Pakistan. Shah, the co-curator from Karachi, says the show was intended to steer clear of “nationalistic tropes”. She adds: “There has been no exhibition of this scope and scale – in Pakistan or outside. Exhibitions like Manzar destabilise the hegemony of narrow, linear, western art-historical perspectives and narratives and present alternative modes of seeing.”</p> <p>A feminist voice included in the show is Naiza Khan, who in 2019 was the <a href=\"https://www.rsa.ox.ac.uk/news/detail/naiza-khan-bfa-1990-is-the-first-artist-to-represent-pakistan-at-the-venice\">first ever</a> artist to represent Pakistan at the Venice Biennale. “This is a seminal exhibition, ambitious in scope and scale,” Khan says, stating that the show evoked “a sense of pride”.</p> <p>“It is the first major exhibition of art and architecture from Pakistan in the region. Doha has a large community of the south Asian diaspora that live and work there, which creates another web of context and relationship for the community.”</p>    <p>Khan completed a BA in fine art at Oxford in 1990. She then moved to Karachi and forged a close relationship with the ocean and its connection with the landmass of Africa and beyond. She has been fascinated with the idea of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON88tDUNcKE&amp;t=5s\">mapping space</a>”, and concerned with environmental justice and the exploitation of land. Sticky Rice and Other Stories is a filmic installation at Manzar that traces a mental map of the region around Karachi, from the colonial textile trade to containerised cargo shipping.</p> <p>Hundreds of Birds Killed – Khan’s artwork at Venice – is a combination of brass maps and a soundscape of the weather, which has its roots in a 1939 archival weather report in colonial India found by Khan in the ruins of an observatory on Manora Island, south of Karachi. “I was fascinated by the visual tabulation of weather data across the pages of this report,” she says. “It was detailed, specific and engineered, and revealed the dichotomy between imperial mapping and every day reality. Since this project, I am thinking more about archives of weather history and what they tell us. During the early 19th century, the attempt to predict the monsoon in India was wrapped up with [colonial interests].”</p> <p>The brass clusters used in the artwork are from toys found in secondhand markets in Karachi. There are 76 cast-brass tiles that make up maps of cities affected by the storms. Khan says General Zia-ul-Haq’s discriminatory politics led to the formation of the Women’s Action Forum (WAF) platform in 1981.</p> <p>One of Khan’s favourite works in the exhibition is Zubeida Agha’s “playful” 1956 oil-on-canvas Karachi By Night, created in the same year as the constitution of Pakistan, under which the country became an Islamic Republic. “Artists in Pakistan have pushed against many political and social forms of censorship,” Khan says. “Art has been a resistance and a critique, a mirror of truth to the social order, and that has been one of the strengths of art produced in Pakistan.”</p> <p>The exhibition also showcases works by architects such as Yasmeen Lari and Nayyar Ali Dada, exploring how they reflect Pakistan’s evolving identity. It emphasises sustainable design, responses to climate challenges, and the transformative role of the Aga Khan award for architecture, which debuted in Lahore in 1980, celebrating projects such as Lari’s community-focused designs and <a href=\"https://the.akdn/en/resources-media/resources/publications/aga-khan-trust-culture-shigar-fort-residence-baltistan\">the Shigar Fort restoration</a>.</p>    <p>There are three examples of flood-relief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/25/this-will-not-be-swept-away-the-bamboo-homes-helping-pakistans-post-flood-rebuild\">bamboo shelters</a> in the museum courtyard, designed by Lari and the Heritage Foundation of Pakistan. There is also a focus on Zahoor ul Akhlaq, who – despite being widely recognised as one of the most influential Pakistani artists – has remained relatively under-researched until recently. In an essay for the museum catalogue, Mirza highlights Akhlaq as a pivotal figure who “connected the art of the present to the art of the past” by bridging historical practices, such as Mughal miniature painting and Islamic geometry, with postmodern sensibilities.</p> <p>Mirza said he found his own artistic language after reading Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, which he found in 1984 on a friend’s bookshelf. “I read it,” he says, “and then I thought, ‘Oh my God, what he did through literature, why can’t I do through my own work?’”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/07/architect-yasmeen-lari-royal-gold-medal-2023-interview-pakistan-barefoot-social-architecture-floods-earthquake-what-a-terror-i-was-when-i-designed-those-mammoth-buildings\">Architect Yasmeen Lari: ‘The international colonial charity model will never work’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mirza graduated from the National College of Arts in Lahore in 1986 before completing a master’s in painting at Royal College of Art, London, in 1991. He is particularly inspired by children’s drawings. The highlight of the show, in Mirza’s opinion, is a bronze sculpture by Huma Bhabha called <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5709382\">The Orientalist</a>, a powerful and thought-provoking piece featuring an ambiguous figure sitting on a chair, with a mix of human, alien, and totemic features.</p> <p>“The sculpture is somehow disfigured and decayed and dehumanised,” says Mirza, “so everyone can read it through his or her lens. But for me, it is a kind of rotten or rotting authority, like Zia-ul-Haq.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://nmoq.org.qa/en/calendar/manzar-exhibition/\">Manzar: Art and Architecture from Pakistan 1940s to Today</a> is hosted by the National Museum of Qatar, in Doha, until 31 January</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Edinburgh’s New Year’s Eve street parties and fireworks display have been cancelled on safety grounds because of storms forecast for the next 36 hours.</p> <p>The city’s Hogmanay festival organisers said the high winds and rain predicted to hit the city made it unsafe to hold any of the outdoor events planned for Monday and Tuesday nights.</p> <p>Those include the fireworks display from the castle, a concert in the gardens underneath the castle headlined by Texas and the street party along Princes Street, affecting 50,000 people who were expected to attend. Indoor events including a concert headlined by Idlewild and a candlelit concert at St Giles’ Cathedral will go ahead as planned.</p> <p>“We know that this will be hugely disappointing to all hoping to celebrate Hogmanay in Edinburgh and that people travel from around the world to be here at the home of Hogmanay,” the organisers said.</p> <p>Blackpool council in north-west England said it had also taken the “tough decision” to cancel its fireworks display after the Met Office issued a number of weather warnings for most of the country until Wednesday.</p> <p>Scotland is experiencing “fairly persistent rain” and snow, with a warning in place until midnight on New Year’s Eve. Rainfall of 50-70mm is widely expected, with 100-140mm in some places<strong>, </strong>with an amber weather warning for parts of the Highlands and Moray.</p> <p>In all, three yellow weather warnings are in place for rain and snow, and for wind, across the Scottish mainland and islands.</p> <p>Northern England will be battered by high winds – including gusts of up to 60mph on Monday – with a yellow warning for wind on Tuesday for northern England and Northern Ireland, the forecaster said.</p> <p>Parts of Wales face a yellow warning for rain on Tuesday and Wednesday, while southern England is under a yellow warning for wind on New Year’s Day. Gusts of up to 60mph are forecast across England and Wales on Wednesday, with 75mph winds likely in coastal and hilly areas.</p> <p>The Met Office warned transport delays were “likely” on New Year’s Eve as strong winds could reach 70mph in England and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>London’s firework celebration – the largest annual display in Europe, according to the Greater London Authority, with 100,000 people expected to attend – was going ahead despite the forecast.</p> <p>A Met Office spokesperson, Oli Claydon, said there could be travel disruption “from strong wind and, in particular, where the wind and rain overlap”. On Monday, trains were running at reduced speeds between Newcastle and Berwick-upon-Tweed due to blustery conditions.</p> <p>In Scotland, ferries and trains had already been disrupted. The Highland Main Line was closed because of high water levels on the Gynack Burn, at Kingussie. Parts of Scotland face an amber warning between midnight and 5pm on New Year’s Eve, indicating the likelihood of property flooding and travel disruption.</p> <p>“Extremely high water levels are expected in Speyside, the Great Glen and Tayside, resulting in disruptions to transport and to communities,” said Cordelia Menmuir, the duty flood manager at the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. “We’re likely to see extensive river and surface water flooding impacts across these areas.”</p> <p>Menmuir urged people in affected areas to consider whether their journeys were necessary, and to prepare for flooding.</p> <p>Stefan Laeger, a flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Heavy and persistent rain means river levels could be high across parts of the Midlands and the north of England on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, when significant inland flooding is possible but not expected. Environment Agency teams will be out on the ground, taking action to reduce the impact of flooding and support those communities affected.”</p> <p>Laeger urged people to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water “as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car”.</p> <p>A warning of persistent snow has been issued for Orkney and Shetland between 5am and midnight on New Year’s Eve.</p> <p>After New Year’s Day, widespread cold and frosty conditions are expected on Thursday night.</p> <p>Jane Meagher, the leader of Edinburgh council, said there were numerous indoor events still taking place in the city, in an effort to console revellers.</p> <p>“I know that, like me, many people will be very disappointed. This decision was not taken lightly, however with the ongoing adverse weather condition, public safety must be our number one priority,” she said.</p>",
