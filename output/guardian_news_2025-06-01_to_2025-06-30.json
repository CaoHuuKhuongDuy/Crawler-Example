Explosions echoed over Tel Aviv as Israel’s air defence systems responded.</p> <p>At the same time, Israel launched a new wave of attacks against missile storage and launch infrastructure sites in Iran, the Israeli military said.</p> <p>An Israeli military official said Iran had fired five ballistic missiles and there were no immediate indications of any missile impacts or reports of casualties.</p> <p>The new attacks came as Israel’s foreign minister said its strikes on Iran had delayed Tehran’s potential to develop a nuclear weapon by “at least two or three years”. Israel’s offensive has produced “very significant” results, Gideon Saar told German newspaper Bild in an interview published on Saturday.</p> <p>At the United Nations on Friday, Israeli ambassador <strong>Danny Danon </strong>vowed that his country would not stop its attacks on Iran until the country’s nuclear threat was dismantled, while Iran said it would continue to defend itself against Israel.</p> <p>“We will not stop,” Danon said during a UN security council session in New York. “Not until Iran’s nuclear threat is dismantled, not until its war machine is disarmed, not until our people and yours are safe.”</p> <p>Iran’s UN ambassador, <strong>Amir Saeid Iravani</strong>, urged the security council to take action, saying: “Israel apparently declared that it will continue this strike for as many days as it takes. We are alarmed by credible report that the United States ... may be joining this war.”</p>    <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The UN secretary general warned on Friday that expansion of the Israel-Iran conflict could “ignite a fire no one can control”</strong>. António Guterres called on both sides to “give peace a chance” and said the conflict must not be allowed to expand.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump said Europe would not be able to help much in the Iran-Israel war</strong>. “Iran doesn’t want to speak to Europe, they want to speak to us,” the US president said. “Europe is not going to be able to help in this one.” European foreign ministers urged Iran on Friday to engage with Washington over its nuclear program after talks in Geneva aimed at opening negotiations for a new nuclear deal ended with little sign of progress.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency warned that attacks on nuclear facilities could result in “radioactive releases with great consequences</strong> within and beyond boundaries” of the state attacked. Rafael Grossi also called for maximum restraint.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump said his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was wrong in suggesting there was no evidence Iran was building a nuclear weapon</strong>. Later on Friday Gabbard said on social media that the media had taken her words “out of context” and that she agreed with the president.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israeli fire killed at least 44 Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, many who were seeking food aid</strong>, local officials said. At least 25 people awaiting aid trucks were killed by Israeli action south of Netzarim in central Gaza, the Hamas-run local health authority said. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at suspected militants who advanced in a crowd towards them and the Israeli aircraft then fired a missile and “eliminated the suspects”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UN’s children’s agency said the scarcity of drinking water in Gaza was at a crisis point and “children will begin to die of thirst”</strong>. Unicef said a shortage of fuel to operate wells and desalination plants in the territory meant it “is facing what would amount to a man-made drought”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The European Union has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jun/20/eu-israel-human-rights-obligations-gaza-document\">“there are indications” that Israel is in breach of human rights obligations</a> over its conduct in Gaza</strong>, but stopped short of calling for immediate sanctions. The leaked document from the EU’s foreign policy service, seen by the Guardian, represents a significant moment in Europe’s relations towards a longstanding ally.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

            "body" : "<p>Frank Sinatra did it his way, taking to the pool to boost his vocal prowess, and it seems Rod Stewart is singing from the same songsheet. Now scientists say the approach might not be somethin’ stupid.</p> <p>Stewart, 80, is still entertaining fans with his raspy vocals and energetic stage performances and earlier this month he revealed that as well as running and playing some football, swimming also played a key part in his campaign to stay forever young.</p> <p>He is due to play the legends slot at Glastonbury next Sunday and has more than 40 other shows lined up in Europe and America this year, and he incorporated swimming into his fitness regime to help keep his vocals fine-tuned.</p> <p>“We do a lot of underwater training, where the trainer throws a brick into the pool and I have to dive in, push the brick to the end of the pool and come up,” <a href=\"https://www.wwbl.com/2025/06/09/rod-stewarts-unusual-brick-into-the-pool-workout-helps-keep-him-fit-at-80/\">Stewart told the AARP</a> magazine.</p> <p>Stewart said the advice came from Sinatra himself, who told him: “Rod, the secret to being a great singer is having powerful lungs. Do lots of underwater swimming, where you hold your breath.”</p> <p>Dr Rebecca Moseley-Morgan, the chair of research at the British Voice Association, said respiratory function was one of the main areas to suffer due to age-related changes, leading to problems including having insufficient breath for long musical phrases.</p> <p>But she noted it could be maintained through cardio exercise of any sort, including swimming, while breath management exercises could also help.</p> <p>Stewart said: “I keep myself very fit. I played soccer all my life – don’t so much any more, because I had a knee replacement. And I’ve always had a trainer – same guy for 38 years.”</p> <p>He has also taken up running 100 metres on a private track at his huge estate to keep himself “very fit”, he said, and is now working on his speed, aiming to break a world record.</p> <p>“I got it down to 19 seconds by learning how to push off,” he told AARP magazine. “I’m going to try and do 17 seconds, which I think is a world record for an 80-year-old.”</p>    <p>Moseley-Morgan said: “Thinking of Rod Stewart … he will be feeling the age-related changes and sensibly, in my opinion, is trying to rectify matters. The breath is the power source of the voice, so without it singing is not possible.” </p> <p>Prof Monica McHenry, the director of the speech and voice physiology lab at New York Medical College, said underwater swimming may help people hold their breath, which could help them tolerate the drop in oxygen in the body that occurs when singing – potentially helping them sing long phrases or hold on to a note for a long time.</p> <p>“The basis for holding a note is having enough air to keep the vocal folds vibrating as you sustain the note,” she said. “Holding your breath will not help you get more air … but it will help you feel less breathless as you do it.”</p> <p>Dr Keir Philip, of Imperial College London, who specialises in respiratory medicine, said professional singers and swimmers had been found to have better lung function than the general public, with larger lung volumes and stronger respiratory muscles.</p> <p>While Philip said it could be that people who are genetically predisposed to have better lung function are more likely to be swimmers or singers, it was possible such activities boosted lung function. As a result, swimming may be beneficial for singers.</p> <p>“[Stewart] is a very active performer, and that goes beyond just your breath control. It’s the cardiovascular fitness, the strength, stamina and flexibility to be a performer,” Philip said, noting that swimming is a low-impact form of exercise that is good for older people and those, like Stewart, who have had knee replacements.</p> <p>“I also think that if Rod Stewart and Frank Sinatra think it has helped them then it probably has. Their lived experience and expertise is valuable on a topic currently lacking in large [randomised control trials],” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/19/sailing-towards-glastonbury-rod-stewart-greatest-solo-songs-ranked\">Sailing towards Glastonbury: Rod Stewart’s greatest solo songs – ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Philip cautioned that the general public should consult with their doctor before trying underwater swimming and breath-holding, noting it would not be a good idea for people with certain conditions.</p> <p>“Although there is reason to [think] these approaches might help, there is definitely not sufficient evidence to advise people in general to use this approach,” he said.</p> <p>“If people would like to improve their general lung health, they should prioritise not smoking or vaping, avoiding indoor and outdoor air pollution, regular exercise, eating well, sleeping well and building good social networks.”</p> <p>Not all singers swear by swimming. David Alacey, a renowned Sinatra tribute performer, said: “I did try the underwater method but it didn’t work for me as I felt it distracted from the whole idea of singing. Far be it for me to disagree with Mr Sinatra’s methods but I found working on the diaphragm far more effective.”</p> <p>Indeed, when it comes to performing, it seems anything goes. “Sinatra also developed a little cheat method where he would grab an extra breath out of the corner of his mouth while singing,” Alacey said. “That’s also great tool for singers.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When my boyfriend proposed, I said yes – not because I was madly in love with him, but because it seemed like the correct thing to do. We’d been together for eight years and all of our friends were getting engaged; my life felt like a constant cycle of hen nights. I knew something was wrong but I suppressed it. Sometimes I’d get these flashes of anxiety. I’d worry about the fact that I no longer felt excited when my boyfriend walked into a room, or that we didn’t have sex any more – but I was 28, which at that point felt ancient to me, and I was frightened of being alone. I told myself I was experiencing nothing more than a classic case of pre-wedding jitters. I threw myself into buying the big white dress and designing the invitations. I planned to stash a bottle of gin in the church, so I could have a shot to calm my nerves before I walked down the aisle.</p> <p>About three months before the wedding, I was home alone one evening and decided to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/25/sleepless-in-seattle-at-30-nora-ephrons-romcom-tom-hanks-meg-ryan\">Sleepless in Seattle</a>. It was my father’s favourite film – he loved the classic jazz soundtrack and Nora Ephron’s dialogue. It had been on in the background a lot during my childhood and teenage years, so I was expecting it to be a comfort watch; something to almost lull me to sleep. I’d remembered the film as being about a man (Tom Hanks) and his cute son grieving the death of his wife. But that night I interpreted the film completely differently. I was sucked into the perspective of Meg Ryan’s character, Annie, who is engaged to a perfectly decent but slightly boring man – and deciding whether or not to call it off. I’d always seen Sleepless in Seattle as being about bereavement, but that night on my sofa, it felt like a film about one woman’s decision whether to get married, and play it safe, or give it all up and take a leap.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My wedding venue was booked, the deposit paid. But as the film went on I began to feel this overwhelming sadness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There’s a scene towards the beginning where Annie is trying on a wedding dress at her family home. Her mother is talking about the “magic” she felt when she first laid eyes on her own husband, and Annie’s face just goes completely blank. You can tell she doesn’t feel anything close to “magic” with Walter, her fiance. Watching that scene, I felt the familiar squirm of panic, but I squashed it down. I did love my boyfriend, in a way. We trusted each other and were good friends and he cared for me. I told myself: I’m not going to be the person who has the magic, and I’m OK with that. I’m going to be the person who has a sensible, kind husband, and children, and a life that is beautifully mapped out.</p> <p>But as the film went on I began to feel this overwhelming sadness. My wedding venue was booked, the deposit was paid – but watching Annie agonise over whether or not to leave Walter, I began to realise that the way I was feeling about my own wedding couldn’t be ignored. Right at the end, Annie tells Walter about her doubts, and he has a line that illuminated everything for me: “I don’t want to be someone that anyone settles for. Marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn’t it?” I realised, listening to that, how selfish I was being. My boyfriend was good and generous. He didn’t deserve to be “settled” for. He didn’t deserve to have a wife who had to get drunk to force herself down the aisle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUUGWiZ5q4U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AUUGWiZ5q4U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>That night when he came home, I said I wanted to postpone the wedding. I wasn’t brave enough to outright ask to call it off, but he told me that if I didn’t want to marry him now, he didn’t want to be with me. I like to think perhaps he was having doubts too, but wasn’t able to voice them – I hope that’s true. I emailed all of our guests and told them that the wedding was cancelled, and people were generally supportive. I remember being so grateful that I didn’t have to “face” anyone. I could call the whole thing off while hiding behind a screen. I told my father that Sleepless in Seattle had inspired me to make the decision, but I kept that part a secret from everyone else in my life. He understood, but I suspected other people would think I’d gone mad.</p> <p>I spent about 11 years being single after the breakup, so I definitely had to face my fear of being alone. Often it was hard, feeling like a spare part at my friends’ parties, but as I got older, being “coupled up” and safe lost some of its allure. I saw the cracks in the marriages around me, and I realised coupledom doesn’t actually insulate you from loneliness. I am married now, but I don’t completely buy into the idea that there has to be “magic” in a romantic partnership. I don’t believe in the Disneyland, mind-altering, life-completing version of romance – that part of Sleepless in Seattle just doesn’t ring true to me. But I still believe you should never settle for anyone. </p> <div class=\"element element-callout\" data-campaign-id=\"5633f51d-2a2d-4c03-bdb6-a435bddd0324\" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>",

Black pepper comes from peppercorns, which are green but turn dark brown or black when they’re dried. You can also get white pepper, made from the seed of the pepper plant., 2:D - Elephants’ ears are filled with tiny blood vessels – flapping them helps them cool down. Their ears help them hear well over long distances – and swat bugs!, 3:C - Cats have a third eyelid that cleans and protects the eye, which means they don’t need to blink often, and their upper and lower lids don’t usually completely close. When cats blink slowly, it’s a sign of love and trust., 4:B - A megalodon was a prehistoric shark, one of the biggest to ever live. It weighed as much as 30 great white sharks., 5:A - The bacteria used to make camembert means that as it ripens it produces a lot of smelly compounds, including isovaleric acid (which smells of cheesy feet), methanethiol (a cabbage-like smell) and butyric acid (sweaty). Together they make quite a whiff!</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"6\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"5\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">5 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"4\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">4 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"3\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">3 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"2\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">2 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\" \" data-share=\"I got _/_ in <quiz title>\" data-min-score=\"1\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">1 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\"></p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.mollyoldfield.co.uk/\">Molly Oldfield</a> hosts <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/everything-under-the-sun/id1442273607?mt=2\">Everything Under the Sun</a>, a podcast answering children’s questions.

A 4-mile hop to central London makes for an easy journey to work, especially for one kind of commuter: cyclists.</p> <p>On the morning we visit Clapham High Street, at the height of rush hour, their presence is immediate.</p> <p>In every direction bikes are weaving through traffic, filtering through busy roads in stops and starts. Drivers shout, horns blare and cars cut across each other. Adding to the sense of chaos are pedestrians who step off pavements without looking up from their phones. Near misses are common.</p> <p>At the traffic lights, cyclists, many of them ebike riders with no helmets, zoom through red lights as if they’re not there. Some swerve in and out of bike lanes; one speeds up the wrong side of the road, narrowly avoiding a bus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F19%2FNearMissesNew.mp4&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F19%2FNearMissesNew.mp4\" data-alt=\"Video showing cyclists having near misses with other traffic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F19%2FNearMissesNew.mp4&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F19%2FNearMissesNew.mp4\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>If the scene looks dangerous, statistics on collisions involving bikes suggest it is. This is the stretch of road in Great Britain where the most accidents involving cyclists have happened since 2020.</p> <p>We visited the junction as part of a Guardian investigation into the safety of roads in England, Wales and Scotland. From 2020-23, there were 23 accidents involving cyclists reported to emergency services at the junction where Clapham High Street meets Gauden Road and Lenden Terrace. </p> <p>One pedestrian said crossing the road had become increasingly frightening because cyclists ran red lights, particularly since the arrival of ebikes. “Cyclists put the fear of death into pedestrians now. They jump lights, they go on the pavement, they go counter to the traffic. It’s awful,” she said.</p> <p>On the day we visit there are more law-abiding cyclists than those running red lights or cutting in front of cars. But during the observation period, a bike could be seen hurtling through a red light once every 90 seconds on average.</p> <p>Simon Munk, the head of campaigns and community development at <a href=\"https://lcc.org.uk/\">London Cycling Campaign</a>, said junctions could be particularly risky for cyclists even where there were cycle lanes, as there are at the Clapham junction.</p> <p>“A hugely high proportion of serious and fatal collisions happen at junctions for people cycling and so junctions are the spot where danger is at its most intense.”</p> <p>Road design also played a big part. “Some junctions are almost designed in a way that creates conflict by introducing too many traffic movements across the cycle lanes,” he said. This meant any benefits of the designated lanes “completely disappear”.</p> <p>Kyle Linch, a chef in Mayfair, said he regularly saw cycling accidents around Clapham. “I saw one girl fall off her Lime [bike] yesterday. These two cars came out of nowhere,” he said. “The traffic’s always mental so it’s not that surprising. I definitely wouldn’t say it’s safe.”</p> <p>The popularity of ebikes undoubtedly contributes to the congestion on the road on the morning of our visit. The dockless bicycles whizz around in all directions, irking even other cyclists.</p> <p>One commuter riding their own bike at the junction said: “There’s a lot of cycle lanes and I think drivers are quite cautious.</p> <p>“I have heard of some horrific accidents and know people who have been hit. The ebikes seem to be the worst – running red lights, no helmets – and perhaps that’s because most of the people who ride them have less experience.”</p> <p>For campaigners who want to encourage people to take up cycling, the focus on accident data and dangerous riding is unhelpful. Duncan Dollimore, the head of campaigns at Cycling UK, a charitable membership organisation, said the statistics did not capture the experience of cycling.</p> <p>“Cycling is not an unsafe activity, in fact it’s statistically safe,” said Dollimore. “But that’s not how it feels to many people.”</p> <p>Making the roads safer for cyclists would help to overcome that perception, he said. “The more protection and coherence and separation of infrastructure there is, the more people are likely to cycle, and do so safely.”</p> <p>For the Clapham High Street commuters, good news may be at hand. Helen Cansick, Transport for London’s head of healthy streets investment, said changes were planned for this summer.</p> <p>“We are committed to making changes across the capital so that people can travel safely, whatever mode of transport they choose,” she said. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Lime said the rental company supported the TfL and London councils’ investment in cycling infrastructure. “Cyclists running red lights not only endanger themselves and others, but also undermine public confidence in cycling as a safe, sustainable mode of transport,” they said.</p> <p>“Through regular rider communications, training programmes and penalties for dangerous behaviour, we work to educate riders and encourage safer cycling on our roads.”</p>",

There’s still no sign of any squid, which is the kind of false advertising that ruined The Pink Panther. But that’s good, because squid are terrifying. Once, showing off on holiday, I offered to cook for a group of friends. I&nbsp;didn’t speak the language where we were, and ended up leaving the fishmonger with a big bag of tentacles. As I attempted to remove the head, guts, beak and skin of the creatures, their internal sacs burst, coating me in viscous black ink. I&nbsp;suffered an allergic reaction, don’t&nbsp;eat squid any more, and don’t see those friends.</p> <p>Squid Game the TV show (Netflix, Friday 26 June) has proved even more traumatising. Set on a hidden island, the competition pits hundreds of desperate, indebted people against each other in a series of children’s games. The winner gets millions, while the losers are executed by guards, or die via gruesome, in-game accidents. The show’s brilliance is the way it amplifies the emotional stakes of each set-up. Players bond, form alliances, then have to murder each other to survive. The weak are ganged up on, cowards exploit loopholes in the rules to screw over everyone else, while those who make selfless choices are punished. Usually.</p> <p>It’s hard to discuss Squid Game without spoilering it to Buckaroo. It&nbsp;is such an enclosed world, a Jenga puzzle of individual choices and group consequence. This third, final series was intended to be part of the second, and filmed back to back. Which is to say, don’t drop in here if you haven’t seen the first two. It’ll still be upsetting, it just won’t make any sense.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLPwT05kYjw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OLPwT05kYjw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Let’s speak broadly of the characters, voluntary kidnappees on a starvation diet. The winner of the first Squid Game, who re-entered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/26/squid-game-season-two-review-will-make-you-uncomfortably-bloodthirsty-netflix\">the second</a> to take revenge on its creators, is now dealing with the fallout of a failed insurrection. They spend much of their time chained to a bunk, looking more haunted than a Coney Island funfair. Their nemesis is the Front Man – an overseer who wears a voice-distorting mask and looks like Kryten from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/05/how-we-made-red-dwarf-doug-naylor-craig-charles-bbc\">Red Dwarf</a> dipped in petrol. Other players include a drugged-up psychopath, whose simple pleasures involve watching the light fade in the eyes of the dying. There is also a mother and son, who probably won’t get to stay on the same team. Very upsetty, no spaghetti.</p> <p>Sadly, the VIPs also recur. Members of a wealthy elite, who created the tournament for their amusement. Wearing golden animal masks to make it crystal clear they are ciphers of decadence, they spectate from a neon pot-planted chamber, betting on who lives or dies. Imagine if the participants of Kubrick’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/29/eyes-wide-shut-review-stanley-kubrick-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> ran a board game night. These flimsy characters deliver dialogue so wooden it could have fallen off the back of a Jewson’s lorry. If our world has shown us anything, it is that the evil billionaires are not lazy, grape-eating emperors. They are narcissistic businessmen who get up at 4am to ruin the entire world, not just one small island.</p>    <p>I’m also less engaged by the storylines of organ-harvesting guards, or the ongoing efforts of detective Hwang Jun-ho to locate the island and find his missing brother. Squid Game is compelling because of its games. These diabolical tests plumb the depths of avarice and selfishness, or offer occasions for self-sacrifice and stoicism, depending how they’re played. “Do you still have faith in people?” is a question the overseer poses the hero, who stands on the precipice of an impossible choice. As characters, they embody&nbsp;opposite answers.</p> <p>Game theory, a branch of mathematics that analyses competitive strategies between rational actors, has proved that cooperation outperforms exploitation. In other words, it’s in all our interests to not be bastards. The problem is people are not rational; and having a gun to their heads tends not to help. Moreover, you know what a few rotten apples do to a barrel. This is why Squid Game grips us – we’re afraid of who we really are. We need to be shown ourselves, in the least flattering mirror, yet still be shown not all bad.</p> <p>What will the show’s verdict on us be? There is such cruelty in its premise, vivid glee in its sadism, and previous seasons have hardly ended on an upper. But the game’s not over till it’s over. Let’s see, through a squid darkly.</p>",

Railing against net zero, sky-high energy prices and threats to sovereignty – after supply chain disruption in the Covid crisis, and a fracturing geopolitical landscape – are central to the playbook.</p> <p>There is, however, an irony of a privately educated former commodities trader and career politician offering hope for Britain’s deindustrialised communities, where successive governments have promised – and largely failed – to turn around decades of living standards stagnation.</p> <p>In the first on a series on the battle for Britain’s deindustrialised areas, the Guardian maps out the rise in support for Reform, and speaks to its campaigners, Labour, the Conservatives, union leaders and economists to document the high-stakes fight.</p> <h2>From bitcoin to blast furnaces</h2> <p>From the vantage point of the 34th floor of the Shard, Zia Yusuf explained how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/31/starmer-says-farage-would-spook-the-city-truss-2-he-could-be-right\">Reform would unshackle the City of London</a> by cutting wealth taxes and deregulating bitcoin. But the party’s then chair had his sights elsewhere at the same time.</p> <p>The former Goldman Sachs banker and millionaire startup founder said there was good reason why working-class voters were turning to Reform.</p>    <p>“If you go and speak to people who live in these communities, they just feel completely betrayed,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/reformelection-zip/giv-32554A5EHhmJOoXrb\" data-alt=\"Reform seats if election held today\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/reformelection-zip/giv-32554A5EHhmJOoXrb\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“I spent a lot of time in Runcorn. A lot of this is driven basically by a political class that’s never really thought about the experience of people living in these areas. And Nigel speaks to those people.</p> <p>“[As with] one of the things Trump is trying to do – whatever your views on the approach he is taking – I think we’ve got to manufacture more things here. We’ve got to have energy security. We can’t be in a crazy situation where we’re unable to produce primary steel.”</p> <p>The message of reindustrialisation is viewed as a unifying theme for Reform’s policies. In the pivot to the economic left, Farage’s road trip has taken him to Runcorn and Newton Aycliffe, County Durham – where Reform triumphed in elections last month – and the steel towns of Scunthorpe and Port Talbot. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/09/nigel-farage-reform-uk-welsh-elections-coalmining-revived\">Port Talbot</a>, the south Wales town that recently lost its blast furnaces, he demanded their reopening – along with the valleys’ coalmines.</p> <p>However, Labour is fighting back. Rachel Reeves placed investment and regional economic “renewal” at the heart of her spending review last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/11/whats-in-a-place-name-reeves-seemed-to-think-plenty-in-her-spending-review\">namechecking places that would be sprayed with cash</a>.</p> <p>The government’s long-awaited industrial strategy, due on Monday, is designed to bolster manufacturing, and there are hopes that it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/19/uk-manufacturing-set-for-funding-boost-to-reduce-energy-costs\">tackle sky-high energy prices for industry</a>.</p>    <p>Such is the threat in Labour’s old heartlands that Starmer used a hastily arranged visit to a St Helens glass factory last month to decry Reform for its “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/29/keir-starmer-nigel-farage-reform-uk-spending-plans-truss-meltdown\">fantasy economics</a>”, comparing Farage to Liz Truss.</p> <p>Will Jennings, the professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, said: “The fact they are focusing their campaigns there are because the sorts of voters drawn to their messages are there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/reformsecond-zip/giv-32554CBhJCKGiTiZo\" data-alt=\"Seats where Reform came second to Labour\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/reformsecond-zip/giv-32554CBhJCKGiTiZo\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“The structure of support for Reform, much like for the Brexit party and Ukip before it, very much tends to be in particular areas, described often, sometimes unhelpfully, as ‘left-behind towns’. They tend to be older, have former manufacturing industries, tend to be distant from Westminster, and tend to have suffered economic loss.”</p> <p>Reform came second to Labour in 89 constituencies at the 2024 general election, running Starmer’s party closest in the 103-year-old south Wales Labour stronghold of Llanelli, a steel town once famous for manufacturing tinplate. Most of the constituencies are in the north and Midlands. It is these seats where the 2029 battle will be most fierce.</p> <h2>Factories mean votes</h2> <p>Analysis by the Guardian shows these target seats have a higher share of manufacturing jobs than the country at large, demonstrating that, despite decades of industrial decline, they remain more dependent than most on steel, car manufacturing and chemicals.</p> <p>Overall they account for a fifth of Britain’s industrial base. Including towns such as Redcar, Wigan and Rotherham, the average share of manufacturing employment is 12.3%, compared with 8.8% for the UK as a whole. The seat of Washington and Gateshead South, home to the vast Nissan factory near Sunderland, has the highest share, at 35.3%.</p> <p>Separate research by the Trades Union Congress shows Labour seats with the most manufacturing jobs are more likely to have Reform as the second party (34% of seats), compared with the average across all Labour constituencies (22%).</p> <p>Recent predictions from MRP models show <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/latest-insights/more-in-common-s-april-mrp/\">Reform would win at least 180 seats</a> if an election was held tomorrow, including nearly all of the places where it placed second to Labour in 2024.</p> <p>Most of the seats cover towns that have been hit hard economically by manufacturing decline.</p> <p>When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, Britain’s industrial base was already dwindling from its peak in the early 20th century, yet still contributed about 30% to GDP. Many areas were also still dominated by industry – including Hartlepool, Burnley and Stoke-on-Trent, where more than half of all jobs were in manufacturing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/manufjobs-zip/giv-32554qabh9pcCzob1\" data-alt=\"Manufacturing jobs in 1981 and 2018 map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/manufjobs-zip/giv-32554qabh9pcCzob1\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The deindustrialisation of the 1980s was, however, brutally fast as the UK transitioned to a more services-oriented economy, reliant on imported goods. Today manufacturing accounts for about a tenth of annual output.</p> <p>But Reform is not only targeting nostalgia for a bygone age when Britain made things. When the factories closed, the jobs they offered were either not replaced or were supplanted by lower-paid, insecure work. Whole towns have suffered economically as a result, falling behind the rest of the country despite the promises of successive governments to turn things around.</p> <p>Austerity made matters worse. Last month, research by academics at the University of Staffordshire showed cuts since 1984 have disproportionately affected coalfield and deindustrialised areas, including reductions in welfare and benefit worth £32.6bn between 2010 and 2021.</p> <p>Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, said: “Whichever lens you look at – economic, social, environmental – those places have been lost, and in that sense they have been left behind. And if not overlooked, then underinvested in, systematically, over at least a generation. If not two.</p> <p>“The longer that has gone on and has turned into generational stasis, or a lack of social mobility, the greater people in those places have willingness to seek redemption elsewhere. Brexit was that, almost a decade ago. And Reform might be it now.”</p> <p>Haldane, the architect of levelling up, and a key figure in the last government’s industrial strategy, said Farage had effectively become a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working classes</a>”.</p> <h2>A detailed picture</h2> <p>The Guardian’s analysis shows Reform’s target seats would have an average ranking on the English index of multiple deprivation of 92, out of 543 places in total, with 1 being the most deprived.</p> <p>The index brings together a wide range of data sources to build a picture of deprivation, including income, work, education, health and crime rates.</p> <p>Average wages are £65 a week lower than the UK average. Unemployment, economic inactivity and the rate of jobless benefit claims are higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/reformtargets-zip/giv-32554dia5b5tfrztF\" data-alt=\"Reform’s target seats chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/reformtargets-zip/giv-32554dia5b5tfrztF\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>To track the rise of Reform, Labour researchers have been using data from parliamentary petitions as a straw poll to see if the party is growing in their local area.</p> <p>Analysts are poring over data from the “<a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700143\">Call a General Election</a>” online poll, launched within months of the last one, and signed by 3 million people. Signatories have to enter a postcode, enabling support to be plotted geographically. Hotspots included Essex and Lincolnshire – Reform strongholds.</p> <p>“We’re looking at how active they are, where we can assign a high probability that it [a petition] is being driven by Reform or their organised groups via WhatsApp,” said one adviser to a Labour MP.</p> <p>Almost all the Reform target seats backed Brexit, including 15 Labour won from the Tories in 2024. Most had only been Tory since 2019, when many decades-old Labour seats backed Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” and “get Brexit done” messages.</p> <p>On average, leave voters tend to be more socially conservative and anti-immigration. Many “red wall” MPs are pushing Starmer to adopt a tougher stance on immigration as a result, including the Blue Labour caucus founded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/25/maurice-glasman-blue-labour-book-interview\">Maurice Glasman</a>. Reform has pushed hard on the issue, in a high-stakes campaign after last summer’s riots across the UK – including in many post-industrial towns.</p> <p>Experts said economic conditions alone did not explain anti-migrant views or justify rioting, but that austerity and stalling living standards fuelled grievances and mistrust of institutions.</p>    <p>Luke Telford, a criminal and social policy academic at the University of York and author on Brexit and deindustrialisation, said: “The key narratives we heard in the months after [the riots] was it is all about the far right and social media.</p> <p>“Undoubtedly that’s an important contributor to the outbursts of inarticulate rage we saw. But that rage doesn’t occur in a vacuum, it is bound to certain social, cultural and economic conditions that combined.</p> <p>“It’s certain that the areas among the most deprived, were among those with high levels of rioting. It’s impossible to ignore that kind of correlation.”</p> <p>However, fetishising industrial jobs and prioritising the restoration of British manufacturing might not be the best route to an economic renaissance. Not least because England’s regions are more economically and culturally diverse places than some in Westminster give them credit for.</p> <p>Many economists say the idea is riddled with misunderstanding about modern Britain, where its strengths mainly lie in high-value services, rather than on low-paid production that is at risk of being automated away.</p> <p>Most Britons think manufacturing is <a href=\"https://www.shu.ac.uk/news/all-articles/latest-news/savanta-poll\">important for the economy</a>. Most parents do not want their children to pursue a career in the sector.</p> <p>“I don’t think you have to replace manufacturing job with manufacturing job in a Trump-like fashion to resist the rise of populism,” said Haldane.</p> <p>“But you do need to replace them with something that is at least as good, in terms of quality of work, pay, security and a degree of pride around it. And you do need to invest in the supporting infrastructure. Whether that’s transport, housing, or social infrastructure – like youth clubs and parks.”</p> <h2>Trump links</h2> <p>Reindustrialisation runs like a seam of coal through the rhetoric of rightwing populists worldwide – seen most prominently in Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign to “bring back” factory jobs to rust belt states.</p> <p>Much of the intellectual driving force behind reviving industry emanates from the US. The economist Oren Cass and his American Compass conservative thinktank, with close ties to JD Vance in particular, has promoted a “new right” strategy prioritising a pro-worker, pro-trade union, pro-industry agenda that is scathing of corporate America.</p>    <p>Cass was among speakers – including Farage and Kemi Badenoch – at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/20/us-culture-war-show-arc-london-strikes-chord-european-populists\">London conference</a> held by the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (Arc) this year, sharing a stage with Michael Gove, the Spectator editor and former Tory cabinet minister.</p> <p>Founded by the Canadian psychologist and self-help author Jordan Peterson and the Tory peer Philippa Stroud, Arc’s financial backers include the British hedge fund manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/28/loud-and-uncowed-how-unherd-owner-paul-marshall-became-britains-newest-media-mogul\">Paul Marshall</a> and the Dubai-based investment firm Legatum – who also co-own GB News, where Farage has a prime-time show.</p> <p>Another figure is Matthew Goodwin, also a GB News commentator and regular speaker at Reform rallies. An ex-academic, he studied what he calls the “realignment” of British politics, whereby the left has shifted to supporting liberal, metropolitan values, allowing the right to hoover up more socially conservative, working-class voters.</p> <p>Farage and Trump share common ground in promising to roll back net zero – ostensibly to boost manufacturing jobs in heavier polluting sectors, including oil and gas, coal, steel and chemicals.</p> <p>And both are courting trade union members and their worries over foreign competition, the impact of decarbonisation and high energy costs on heavy industry.</p>    <p>Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which includes offshore workers in Scotland among its members, has called for an “honest debate” about Labour’s plans for industry. He told the Guardian that net zero advocates on the left risked fuelling support for Reform by leaving workers out of the debate.</p> <p>“Climate fundamentalism and rightwing populism are two cheeks of the same backside,” he said.</p> <p>“We need to have a programme about jobs and apprenticeships to bring back hope. Neoliberalism is dead and globalisation as we knew it is over. Working-class people aren’t voting for cheap TVs and training shoes. They want their jobs back.”</p> <p>At an event in Westminster late last year to lobby Labour MPs on high manufacturing energy costs, GMB’s shop stewards were approached uninvited by the Reform deputy leader, Richard Tice, trying to curry their favour.</p> <p>But while Reform can count on support from some union members, the labour movement’s leaders are furious at its overtures. “We wouldn’t talk to those fuckers. Load of posh boys hanging tough for the working class? They can go fuck themselves,” said one union boss.</p> <p>Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The hypocrisy is stunning. This is a guy [Farage] who was hanging on the coat-tails of Donald Trump. He turns up at Scunthorpe saying he wants to save British Steel at the same time as his mate in the White House is slapping tariffs on steel and could cost jobs across Britain’s manufacturing base.</p> <p>“In industrial communities there is a lot of cynicism about politics and whether it can make a difference. But it can make a tangible difference to peoples lives who is in Downing Street.”</p> <p>For Labour, the challenge from Farage showed the importance of an “ambitious” industrial strategy, he said. It could be central to its hopes of winning a second term.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Rachel Reeves and her government colleagues are keen to get more Britons investing in the stock market. She <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1720562221879289\">said recently</a> that a lot of money was being put into cash savings accounts “when it could be invested in equities, in stock markets, and earn a better return”.</p> <p>The good news is that the rise of DIY tools and mobile apps means it is now easier than ever to get investing. However, the vast array of options can make it daunting to know where to start.</p> <p>For new investors who don’t have the time or confidence to manage a portfolio, “robo-advisers” can be a good option. They might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie but are basically online investment platforms that use technology to help automate the process. Most are app-based and typically offer a range of ready-made investment portfolios tailored to your individual preferences.</p> <p>You usually fill in a short questionnaire to determine your goals, how long you want to invest for, and how much risk you want to take.</p> <p>Typically, the longer you are investing for, the more risk you can afford to take. But you need to factor in your personal attitude to risk, too. Stocks and shares have historically delivered better returns than savings accounts, but there is also a chance you could lose money – and there will be ups and downs along the way – so you need to feel comfortable about this before taking the leap.</p> <p>The ready-made portfolios typically invest in a selection of exchange traded funds (ETFs). These are low-cost funds that track a chosen index such as a UK or US stock market, government bonds (such as UK gilts or US Treasury bills) or the price of a commodity such as gold.</p> <p>The apps put a selection of these funds together to create a balanced portfolio which spreads your money across different assets.</p> <p>So which of the apps – if any – is right for you? We looked at some of the most popular ones to see how they stack up.</p>    <h2>Nutmeg</h2> <p><strong>Who?</strong> One of the first robo-advisers to hit the market, Nutmeg launched in 2012, and in 2021 it was bought by the investment company JPMorgan Chase. It has more than 200,000 users in the UK, with more than £4.5bn invested through the app.</p> <p><strong>Minimum investment:</strong> £500 for Isas and pensions, £100 for lifetime Isas and junior Isas.</p> <p><strong>Investment choice:</strong> Nutmeg has different tiers of service, which will affect costs. With its fully managed option, you choose a risk level from one to 10, and a team monitors the portfolio and makes regular adjustments. With the fixed allocation option, there are five risk levels and the portfolio is set by the investment team once a year.</p> <p><strong>Fees: </strong>Nutmeg says the total charge for the fully managed option is 0.98%. Someone investing £3,000 would pay about £29.40 a year. For fixed allocation, it is 0.65% – about £19.60 a year for that example.</p> <p><strong>We like:</strong> Nutmeg is transparent about performance, and you can see how its fully managed portfolios have done over the past decade. For example, the 6/10 risk portfolio has returned 43.4% over 10 years, compared with 36.7% on average for comparable funds. The 5/10 portfolio is up 31.9% over that time, compared with 36.7% for its peers.</p> <p><strong>Anything else?</strong> For those who want more support, Nutmeg offers free guidance to help with general questions, and full financial advice starting from £900.</p> <h2>Moneybox</h2>    <p><strong>Who? </strong>Launched in 2016, Moneybox specialises in savings and investments and is reported to now have more than 1.5 million customers and in excess of £10bn of assets under management.</p> <p><strong>Minimum investment: </strong>You can open an account with as little as £1.</p> <p><strong>Investment choice:</strong> There are just three core options: cautious, balanced and adventurous. The cautious option has just 15% in company shares, with 40% in bonds and 40% in cash, which makes it less risky but means your returns may not be as impressive as with other options. The adventurous option has 80% in shares, 15% in property and 5% in bonds.</p> <p><strong>Fees: </strong>A £1-a-month subscription fee covers trading costs. Then there’s a 0.45% platform fee, plus the cost of your actual investments – 0.17% for the core funds. Moneybox says someone with £3,000 invested in its balanced fund would pay total charges of 0.85% – about £25.60 a year.</p> <p><strong>We like: </strong>The round-ups feature. Link your bank account or credit card to the app, and it will round your spending to the nearest pound and automatically invest the difference. For example, if you spent £1.87, it would be rounded to £2, with 13p invested – a handy way to boost your contributions.</p> <p><strong>Anything else? </strong>Those who feel more confident can pick their own ETFs to invest in rather than the ready-made portfolios. Or, if you want to cherrypick specific companies, there is a limited range of stocks to select – though currently only US stocks are available.</p> <h2>Dodl</h2> <p><strong>Who?</strong> Dodl is the newest of this cohort, launched only in 2022, but it is owned by the wealth management giant AJ Bell, which has been around since 1995. Dodl offers a simpler process and lower minimum investment level than its parent company, and a more limited choice of investments.</p> <p><strong>Minimum investment:</strong> £100, or set up a direct debit from £25 a month.</p> <p><strong>Fees:</strong> 0.15% a year, with a minimum of £1 a month, plus the cost of your investments – 0.31% for the core range. Someone with £3,000 invested would pay about £19.30 a year.</p> <p><strong>Investment choice:</strong> The range of ready-made funds, run by AJ Bell, are labelled by risk level – from cautious to global growth. You can also choose individual shares, with the ability to browse by region (either the UK or US) and sector (such as finance, health or technology).</p> <p><strong>We like:</strong> The option to invest by theme, which directs you to a relevant ETF for your trend of choice. For example, the “On top of the world” theme invests in the HSBC FTSE All-World, an index of some of the biggest companies around the globe, which charges 0.13%. Other options include “the home team” for UK-focused investments, and “robo revolution” for a fund investing in robotics companies.</p> <p><strong>Anything else?</strong> It pays a competitive 4.25% (variable) on cash you have not yet invested.</p>    <h2>Wealthify</h2> <p><strong>Who?</strong> Founded in 2014, Wealthify is now owned by the insurance giant Aviva and has about 100,000 customers. It has a big focus on keeping things simple and jargon-free.</p> <p><strong>Minimum investment:</strong> Currently £1 for Isas and £50 for pensions, though from Wednesday 25 June the minimums will be £1 for junior Isas, and £500 for stocks and shares Isas and pensions.</p> <p><strong>Investment choice: </strong>There are five risk levels: cautious, tentative, confident, ambitious and adventurous. The cautious portfolio has 85% of its assets in government bonds and just 5% in company shares. The adventurous option has 74% in shares and 14% in government bonds, and also invests in property and infrastructure.</p> <p><strong>Fees:</strong> The platform fee is 0.6%, which includes the cost of managing your portfolio. The cost of your investment on top is 0.16% for a general portfolio, and 0.7% for the ethical option. That adds up to £22.80 a year, or £39 for the ethical option, for someone with £3,000 invested. There is no minimum fee.</p> <p><strong>We like:</strong> Its outlook page, which offers a short overview of the prospects for different investment regions and assets. It’s a handy way for investors to learn a bit more without hours of research.</p> <p><strong>Anything else?</strong> Wealthify boasts of various customer service awards on its website – a good reminder to consider factors aside from fees and the investment range. Always be sure to do your own research and read independent reviews before choosing a provider.</p> <h2>Moneyfarm</h2> <p><strong>Who? </strong>Moneyfarm originated in Italy and launched in the UK in 2016. It now has about 160,000 active users and more than £5bn in assets under management. The firm has backing from big investment groups such as M&amp;G and Allianz.</p> <p><strong>Minimum investment: </strong>£500.</p> <p><strong>Investment choice: </strong>There are seven risk levels for its managed funds, which are regularly rebalanced by the investment team. For example, the 6/7 risk option has 72% of its assets in developed market companies and 10% in emerging markets companies, while the 2/7 risk option invests predominantly in bonds.</p> <p><strong>Fees: </strong>Someone with £3,000 in the actively managed option would pay management fees of 0.75%, plus 0.3% for their investments – equivalent to about £31.56 a year. For the fixed allocation options, which are adjusted just once a year, the management fee is 0.45% plus 0.17% for the investments – a total of 0.62%, or about £18.60 a year for that example.</p> <p><strong>We like: </strong>It is easy to see a breakdown of each portfolio on the website to understand how it is invested. You can see how it invests by asset type, region and sector – and there’s a simple explanation of each, too.</p> <p><strong>Anything else? </strong>As with most of these apps, there is an option to apply environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to your investments, which is good for any investor worried about where their money is going. This will screen out certain investments – for example, heavy polluters or companies with a poor human rights record.

            "body" : "<p>Towards dusk a bonfire was&nbsp;lit and, one after another, the friends we&nbsp;were eating and drinking with hurdled the&nbsp;leaping flames, a&nbsp;pagan ritual thought to provide benefits including improved physical and mental strength, prosperity and&nbsp;fertility.</p> <p>Further heat came from a sauna we&nbsp;made using five sacks of logs –&nbsp;too&nbsp;many, we agreed afterwards. When&nbsp;it&nbsp;got too hot, we&nbsp;escaped into the cool shallows of the&nbsp;pond just a&nbsp;few metres away, repeating this cycle&nbsp;several times.</p>    <p>As we soak up the long, light days of&nbsp;summer, I’m reminded of this magical time I spent in Lithuania celebrating the summer solstice, or Joninės as it’s called there. A suitable translation is Saint John’s festival, a&nbsp;public holiday celebrated each year on 23 and 24 June. The name pays homage to John the Baptist and coincides with his feast day, yet the&nbsp;traditions of Joninės are deeply rooted in the pagan celebration of midsummer, predating Christianity.</p>    <p>Similar pagan festivals take place in&nbsp;the Baltic nations of Estonia and Latvia, known as Jaanipäev and Jāņi<em>,&nbsp;</em>respectively. It’s a time when people travel from the city to gather in&nbsp;the countryside to eat, drink, sing&nbsp;and observe ancient folk traditions relating to fertility, harvest&nbsp;and renewal.</p> <p>I travelled by train from Tallinn to&nbsp;Riga, and on to Kaunas, Lithuania’s second-largest city, to meet my girlfriend, Jūratė. From there, it’s a&nbsp;further 50 miles east to just outside&nbsp;Čiobiškis, where we meet Jūratė’s extended family – about 80&nbsp;of&nbsp;them, from newly borns to octogenarians, of&nbsp;which Julė is the elder and true matriarch presiding over the Joninės celebrations. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>A short drive through the forest brings us to what resembles a bespoke and bijou festival, laden with copious amount of food and drink</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The journey from Čiobiškis to the surrounding countryside requires us&nbsp;to take the small<a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/padaliai-ciobiskis-ferry-lithuania\"> Padaliai-Čiobiškis ferry</a> across the Neris river – travel at&nbsp;its most rustic and serene. This is&nbsp;followed by a short drive through a&nbsp;forest, which brings us to what resembles a bespoke and bijou festival, with family members having travelled from across Lithuania and beyond, all of us laden with copious amounts of food and drink for the two-day celebration.</p> <p>It’s beautiful countryside – fairly flat and wooded, full of waterways providing an abundance of blue mixed with the verdant hues of surrounding vegetation, and punctuated with bright, colourful splashes from the many species of wildflower, such as lupin, cornflower, chicory, yarrow and&nbsp;buttercup.</p> <p>We watch the Neris meandering downstream to the right, and two fishermen, Julius and Česiukas, attempting to catch a trout, perch, bream or perhaps salmon for the table. Meanwhile, Jūratė and her friend Eglė&nbsp;collect small posies of wild flowers to weave into flower crowns, symbols of love and fertility, while I&nbsp;rest on the riverbank enjoying this bucolic scene.</p>    <p>At the centre of the celebrations, beneath a huge structure created from local timber, tables have been joined together to form one great community banquet, flanked by benches on either side. It’s here I taste the intriguing-looking <em>šakotis</em> for the first time – a layered cake resembling a tree, made of&nbsp;butter, eggs, flour, sugar and cream, and cooked on a spit. Its jagged spikes look almost too sharp and angular to eat, but it’s delicious.</p> <p>Dishes brought by Jūratė’s family include salted herring, chanterelles spread on rye bread, a beef and vegetable stew which is very much to&nbsp;my liking, and a boiled tongue wrapped in smoked pig’s ear, which is&nbsp;less so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>A further ritual begins from midnight: the search for a fern that, legend has it, produces a magic, white flower on midsummer eve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other delicacies include <em>cepelinai</em>, dumplings made from grated potato, filled with pork mince and served with&nbsp;bacon gravy and either sour cream or mushroom sauce. My favourite is <em>balandėliai</em>, cabbage leaves filled again with pork mince and served with potatoes. It’s hearty fare for the longest day of the year, washed down with the exquisite cherry liqueur<em> </em>Žagarės.</p> <p>As another bonfire is lit, everyone gathers around the campfire to tell stories and sing traditional folk songs. It is believed that the brighter the flames, the more abundant the harvest will be. Beer, or <em>alus</em>, is in plentiful supply, but the more pagan among us opt for homemade <em>sidras</em> (cider) or the stronger still <em>samanė</em> (moonshine) all of which helps make camping a little more comfortable.</p> <p>A further ritual begins from midnight: the search for <em>papartis</em>, a&nbsp;fern that, legend has it, produces a magic white flower on midsummer eve. Couples wander into the forest to&nbsp;hunt for this mythical bloom, discovering, perhaps, far more besides. I’m told the most common date that babies are born is 25 March, some nine months later on Gandrinės or Stork Day – with the arrival of the country’s national bird signifying the beginning of spring as they return from their winter migration.</p> <p>Yet another name for summer solstice is Rasos, or Dew festival, since&nbsp;it is believed that dew collected on the morning of midsummer is&nbsp;especially potent for fertility, while wild herbs gathered on the night of&nbsp;Joninės<em> </em>are believed to possess magical and healing properties, since&nbsp;this is when&nbsp;nature is at its most&nbsp;powerful.</p>    <p>While paying our own dues to some of the ancient traditions, we also do things our own way, combining music from the radio station LRT Opus with further consumption of <em>alus</em> and Žagarės<em>. </em>I’m sure every family and group of friends celebrate differently, but all that really matters is being together, in nature, with skylarks visible high above and cuckoos audible in the woods.</p> <p>The magnificence of Joninės was captured by the Lithuanian poet and philosopher Vydūnas, who described it&nbsp;as the “feast of the bonfire light meeting the all-encompassing sunlight”. As we make our way a few&nbsp;miles south to the hamlet of Mikalaučiškės for a gathering with some of Jūratė’s friends – since Joninės&nbsp;is very much about celebrating with friends as well as bloodlines –&nbsp;I&nbsp;think of those words written by&nbsp;Vydūnas a century ago. Today’s bonfire is already burning bright amid&nbsp;an&nbsp;everlasting twilight of deep orange,&nbsp;pink and blue, painted above the horizon.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://balticgently.com/celebrate-midsummer-day-jonines-in-lithuania/\">Baltic Gently</a></em><em> organises various Joninės packages across Lithuania, from €75 to €130</em></p>",

This weird but joyous documentary from Morgan Neville uses Lego to encapsulate the life of the wildly successful Neptunes producer and musician. Williams having synaesthesia – he experiences sound as colour – means the film can go off on visual flights of fancy; the beats he creates becoming rainbow fireworks or vibrant waves. All this trippy imagery covers up the fact that his rise to stardom has been fairly frictionless, but contributions from Lego versions of Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg et al attest to his offbeat worldview and hyperactive creativity. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>Saint Omer, 9pm, BBC Four</strong></p>    <p>Why would a mother leave her 15-month-old daughter on a beach to drown? That’s the central question in French film-maker Alice Diop’s murky, moving courtroom drama, as a young Senegalese woman, Laurence (Guslagie Malanda), is put on trial. Lecturer Rama (Kayije Kagame) attends in the hope of writing a book about it, but uneasy resonances with her own life – immigrant family, pregnancy, mixed-race relationship – throw her off-track. Even the evasive, inconsistent Laurence appears unsure as to why she committed such a horrific act. <em>SW</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Men’s Test Cricket: England v India, 10.15am, Sky Sports Main Event </strong>Day two of the first Test in the five-match series at Headingley, Leeds, with Shubman Gill captaining the visitors for the first time.</p> <p><strong>Men’s Tennis: Queens, 1pm, BBC Two </strong>The semi-finals of the grass-court tournament at Queen’s Club.</p> <p><strong>Racing: Royal Ascot, 1.30pm, ITV1 </strong>The final day of the meet, featuring the Jersey Stakes at 4.20pm.</p> <p><strong>International Men’s Football: European Under-21s Championship, 4.45pm, Channel 4 </strong>The first quarter-finals, as the winners of Group C face the Group D runners-up.

Lowestoft’s more visible gull problem, however, is its kittiwakes, another gull species whose population has grown from a single breeding pair in the 1950s to more than 1,000 nests today, splodged messily on to window sills, architraves and shopfronts throughout the town centre and leaving anyone passing underneath at risk of a foul-smelling guano splat.</p> \n<p>And this is not just a problem for Lowestoft.</p> \n<p>All over Britain, and coastal areas in Europe and the US, communities are in a flap about seagulls.</p> \n<p>North Yorkshire council is developing what it calls a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/seaside-towns-yorkshire-strategy-aggressive-seagulls-wtdkpsv83\">gull management strategy</a> in response to increasing complaints of “gull mugging attacks” in towns from Scarborough to Whitby. In <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14631625/Moment-greedy-seagulls-terrorise-young-families.html\">Lyme Regis, Dorset</a>, authorities have introduced a public space protection order (PSPO) banning the feeding of birds to deter swooping herring gulls, having also tried flying drones and birds of prey to scare them away.</p> \n<p>The Highland council recently conducted <a href=\"https://www.highland.gov.uk/news/article/16609/inverness_gull_study\">a census of the birds</a> to feed into its own management plans as herring gull numbers in Inverness and elsewhere soar. It is illegal, otherwise, to harm or capture any wild bird or interfere with its nest. Nevertheless, in March the former Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/25003872.douglas-ross-calls-action-seagulls-following-attacks/\">called on the Scottish parliament</a> to give people licenses to kill gulls, mentioning other Scottish councils that had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on the problem “to no effect”. Put to a newspaper poll, <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25004273.poll-people-allowed-licences-kill-nuisance-seagulls/\">two-thirds agreed</a>.</p> \n<p>If it can seem at times that seagulls are taking over British towns, the fact is that their numbers aren’t rising at all – they are falling sharply. “Seagulls”, in fact, don’t really exist – the term is a catchall for 50 species of gull worldwide, six of which are commonly found in the UK.</p> \n<p>Of these, both the kittiwake and herring gull are “<a href=\"https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/publications/bocc-5-a5-4pp-single-pages.pdf\">red listed</a>”, meaning their breeding populations have experienced perilous drops in recent decades; while other species including the great and lesser black-backed gulls and the (now misnamed) common gull are on the amber list, meaning moderate but still concerning decline.</p> \n<p>In some traditional coastal nesting sites, the most recent national seabird census found, the populations have <a href=\"https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/seabirds-count/\">all but collapsed</a>. South Walney nature reserve in Cumbria had more than 10,000 herring gulls’ nests in 1999 and just 444 in 2020, a drop of 96%, according to Dr Viola Ross-Smith, a <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/learn/about-birds/articles/gulls-allowed\">gull expert</a> at the British Trust for Ornithology. The crash in numbers of lesser black-backed gulls at the same site was even greater, at 98%.</p> \n<p>Why? Alongside the wider biodiversity crisis, say experts, it’s partly because Britain’s gulls are moving into town.</p> \n<p>“When we talk about urban gulls, not only in coastal communities or towns but also increasingly in large urban centres, it’s about recognising that these birds are moving,” says <a href=\"https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/helen-f-wilson/\">Helen F Wilson</a>, a professor of geography at Durham university whose work focuses on the social and cultural geography of humans and other species sharing the same space. “It’s not that they’re increasing in number, but they are shifting away from where we might have expected to see them.”</p> \n<p>There are lots of possible reasons for that she says – warming seas, falls in their prey species, changing in fishing practices, more violent winter storms. Rather than seeing gulls as malign dive-bombers that are after our chips, in other words, we ought perhaps to consider their vulnerability. “We need to think about what [their growth in towns and cities] tells us about what is happening elsewhere,” she says. “Because for whatever reason, these birds are now finding urban environments much better than the coast.”</p> \n<p>They are also just carrying out their natural behaviour. “We often describe herring gulls in very sinister ways: they’re cool, calculating, muggers, cannibalistic – these very moral ways of talking about them. But what we’re actually describing is natural behaviour, whether that’s protecting a nest or simply feeding. Herring gulls snatch food from other birds in the wild, so it stands to reason that they would take things from people’s hands.”</p> \n<p>Ross-Smith agrees. Herring gulls, for instance, can be especially aggressive – she prefers “aggressively defensive” – while their chicks are fledging, “but I wish people understood that the gull is merely being a very protective parent”.</p> \n<p>“We are part of an ecosystem, and we’re in a biodiversity crisis, and I think we need to be a bit more tolerant of the other species around us,” she says.</p> \n<p>As well as big environmental stresses, each town has specific local factors that may have encouraged gulls to settle. In Inverness, for example, the closure of a nearby landfill site in 2005 was one of the drivers of a very sharp increase in the city centre, according to David Haas, a senior community development manager for the Highland council. Having previously reduced the number of nests by physically removing eggs (under license), they have now moved to a range of non-lethal deterrents including the use of lasers, sonar and hawks.</p> \n<p>“As we changed over to these methods, it’s caused a lot of angst amongst people, understandably,” says Hass. They are also mindful that birds shooed from the town centre may simply move to the suburbs, “and we have had evidence of that, where they’re going into residential areas and causing a bit of mayhem in certain spots. But we’re addressing that too. It’s work in progress.”</p> \n<p>Similarly, the initial migration of Lowestoft’s kittiwakes from its docks to its main shopping street and beyond followed the demolition of a derelict structure on which a small number of pairs were happily nesting. Finding town centre ledges even more to their liking than the cliff sides where they naturally roost, their numbers had reached 430 nests by 2018, then 650 in 2021, and more than 1,000 today, according to Dick Houghton, a retired fisheries scientist who now unofficially monitors the birds. “And there are thousands of sites in the town where they could nest,” he says.</p> \n<p>Steam-cleaning kittiwake dung – a pungent brew, given the birds’ diet of sand eels and herring sprat – from the pavement below Lowestoft’s nesting sites is now a daily task, costing East Sussex council £50,000 a year, according to Kerry Blair, the council’s strategic director. “That’s difficult to sustain in the current financial environment, but we can’t not do it,” he says.</p> \n<p>Lowestoft, too, has experimented with nest removal and egg oiling (which stops them developing) in the past, “but we’ve come a long way in terms of understanding our responsibilities”, says Blair. That’s included learning about the birds themselves, he says. Unlike other gulls, kittiwakes don’t snatch food, and spend their winters out to sea in the North Atlantic, allowing old nests to be removed each winter. But they also like to nest in the same spot each year. So if they can’t access that spot next year, it doesn’t mean they’ll fly back out to sea – they’ll simply move to the next available windowsill along.</p> \n<p>It has led to the recognition that the birds aren’t going anywhere, so people will have to learn new ways of living with them, says Blair. Rather than merely ousting the birds from their facades, for instance, building owners are now encouraged to build bespoke nesting ledges for them on more discreet walls away from public footpaths. A row of simple wooden ledges drilled to the side of a BT building now houses as many as 120 kittiwake nests, leaving the public space free of their mess.</p> \n<p>“That’s the journey that the council has been on,” says Blair. “The Lowestoft kittiwake, when we started to look at [the issue], was about the dirt on the pavement, but it’s turned into something else … It’s about trying to see it as an amazing gift, really, to have these very endearing creatures living among us. Yes, it brings a few problems. Let’s deal with all those problems and learn to love them living alongside us. That’s a journey, I think, and more people than you’d expect in this town are starting to feel the same.”</p>",

            "body" : "<h2><strong>‘A 7.30pm dinner on a school night is madness’</strong></h2> <p><em>Stuart Heritage embraces Italian family&nbsp;life</em></p> <p>“Gender roles have not changed very much,” says Manuela Naldini, professor of sociology of the family at University of Turin, of the Italian method of parenting. “Certainly not as much as we would like them to have, and not to the same degree as other European countries.” In practical terms, she says the result of this is that “it is seen as very important for the mother to stay with their child, especially when they are very small”.</p> <p>Italy, she explains, has one of the lowest marriage rates in Europe. Due to financial constraints and high unemployment, children don’t leave the parental home until they are, on average, 30 years old. “This means that they postpone forming a couple, become parents quite old and have fewer children,” says Naldini.</p> <p>The state of the labour market also means that men are far less likely to take parental leave. “If you do that as a father, you are seen as not a very trustworthy person,” says Naldini. So typically mothers find themselves becoming the default parent. “This reinforces the gender division of household work, and the father’s participation remains a little bit circumscribed, especially when the children are very young.”</p> <p>This isn’t great for progress, but it’s absolutely brilliant news for me, because I am a) tasked with following the Italian way of parenting, and b) a man. As such, I think Prof Naldini just gave me permission to slack off.</p> <p>Some context: I am the default parent in our household. My wife’s health has been erratic for a number of years, which means the bulk of the parenting work falls to me. School runs, cooking, organising parties and Christmases, buying presents and clothes, remembering dates, being the point person for schools and friends and clubs: it has all been on my shoulders. It is a constant juggle. But on the flipside, it has also been the single most rewarding thing I have ever done. I am extremely tight with my two boys (aged seven and 10), and my inner control freak relishes the responsibility.</p> <p>However, it isn’t very Italian. Although Naldini says that things are shifting – “fatherhood has changed since the 1990s. Fathers play with their children; they try to be intimate; they collaborate in bathing”– but societal expectation is still that the father earns while the mother parents.</p> <p>Obviously, it would be a little callous of me to suddenly dump everything on to my wife for the purposes of an experiment, but that doesn’t mean that a balance can’t be struck. Luckily, this experiment coincides with an uptick in her health, so she is able to take the kids to school in the mornings while I get the jump on work. There’s talk of her taking them to swimming lessons on Saturday mornings so I can sleep in a little. </p> <p>Which isn’t to say that my children seamlessly transition to a more Italian upbringing, as evidenced when we attempt a family-style dinnertime of our adopted country. This involves all of us eating together at the dinner table at 7.30pm. The eating together part is easy – it’s very rare that we don’t do that normally, though more often than not we’re on the sofa with plates on our laps. But a half-seven dinnertime on a school night with two young kids is madness. My kids tend to be asleep by 8pm. An Italian bedtime pushes this back by over an hour. We naively hope for a lie-in, but this does not happen. The result of this is two crankier-than-usual children the following day. Maybe, we decide, we could only be Italian at weekends.</p> <p>“Italy has a very strong family model in terms of intergenerational solidarity,” Naldini tells me. “Grandparents play a strong role in helping to realise the childcare arrangement. That is something that comes from tradition, from the idea of strong solidarity, not between mother and father, but intergenerational.”</p> <p>I have always been extremely bad at asking for help, and especially from my dad. My mum died in 2017, and he was her carer before that, so as far as I’m concerned he has earned the right to spend his retirement however he likes. Prior to this experiment, it had been a couple of years since I’d asked him to look after the kids. But that was the old me. I’m Italian now, and that means he has to do my work for me. Sorry Dad, I don’t make the rules.</p> <p>We have Dad over for Sunday lunch, and this is where I tentatively tell him about the assignment. To my surprise, he responds with something approaching happiness. He thinks it is a great idea for all involved. He gets to see his grandchildren, my kids will benefit from being looked after by someone else for a bit, and my wife and I can spend time together without having to shout over children. So later that week, I drop the kids off with my dad and take my wife to the cinema. We both fall asleep five minutes in. It is great, and now that particular barrier has been removed, we’ll hopefully do it a bit more often.</p> <p>Obviously, in a just world, Italian families would share the workload equally. Employers would have a more enlightened approach to fathers taking parental leave, and the pressure would be taken off women a bit. However, for this specific experiment, it turns out that the Italian way of life suits me more than I expected. For the last five years, I’ve taken on more than I could handle and haven’t asked for help. If nothing else, then being Italian for a week has taught me a problem shared is a problem halved. <em>Grazie mille</em>, Italia.</p> <p><strong>The dos and don’ts of parenting, Italian</strong><strong> style</strong></p> <p><em><strong>D</strong></em><em><strong>O</strong></em><em><strong> …<br></strong></em><strong>Remind your kids that elders should be respected.</strong></p> <p><strong>Be relaxed about bedtimes.</strong> They will happen when they happen, and not at the expense of mealtimes.</p> <p><strong>Involve your extended family.</strong> As much as possible, if&nbsp;that’s achievable.</p> <p><em><strong>D</strong></em><em><strong>O</strong></em><em><strong>N’T …<br></strong></em><strong>Rely on processed foods at dinner.</strong> Take your time and make something from scratch.</p> <p><strong>Skip family mealtimes.</strong> Anything you eat, you should all eat together.</p> <p><strong>Overschedule extracurricular activities. </strong>Shuttling your kids from swimming lessons to violin practice to karate is far too busy, and not at all Italian.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>‘</strong><strong>We try to get through a day with our child looking immaculate. By lunch, she’s in pants’</strong></h2> <p><em>Lotte Jeffs</em><em> becomes a&nbsp;French&nbsp;maman</em><br></p>    <p>When I was eight and on holiday in France with my&nbsp;parents in 1990, we went out for a meal that none&nbsp;of&nbsp;us have forgotten. An only child, I was being fussy about food and demanded my parents’ play with me. It was then we noticed the French family on the table next to us, with a fellow only child about my age. This girl was compliant, immaculate and eating the same food as everyone else. At one point she accidentally knocked over a glass. Her mother slapped her. According to the French psychotherapist and parenting expert Isabelle Filliozat, this young girl will have probably grown up to become a disciplinarian mother herself. Before it was banned in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-smacking-ban-parents-children-corporal-punishment-a8661191.html\">85% of French parents admitted to smacking their kids </a> and, even now, Filliozat says the country’s standard mode of raising children remains “having them comply”.</p> <p>“That’s a pity,” she says. “We can be just together, side by side. That’s how you raise a child. You’re coaching them through life.” I agree. My wife and I are what has been termed “gentle” parents to our six-year-old. It suits our personalities (empathic, nonconfrontational, calm) and the qualities we wish to nurture in our child (kindness, creativity, humour, self-expression).</p> <p>Filliozat wrote a book, Au Cœur des Émotions de L’enfant, in 1999 about centring children’s emotions. Back then, it was seen as a controversial approach in&nbsp;France. It’s more widely adopted today, but not without its detractors. The main naysayer is French child psychologist Caroline Goldman, who has been rising in popularity. She wants to restore hierarchy in the parent-child relationship, because, she says, “Without order, no peace can exist.” In her 2020 book, File dans Ta Chambre! (Go to Your Room), she recommends disciplining children as young as one with “time-outs”. Parent-child disconnection is also common in the country. A study published in the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that the amount&nbsp;of time mothers are spending with their children each day has been increasing globally – <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/12/we-all-spend-more-time-with-our-kids-except-in-france/\">apart from in France</a>, where mother-child time declined to about an hour per day.</p> <p>According to Goldman, children should be made to understand that they cannot say whatever they feel, speak too loudly or spill their food deliberately (much emphasis is put on correct behaviour at mealtimes). So, that evening we try to sit around the table together for dinner. The importance of family dining is one thing Filliozat and Goldman agree on. But how can I encourage my energetic six-year-old to stay still for long enough? “Give her small tasks so she can move around, like fetching the water or the bread,” suggests Filliozat. Ha! When I ask my daughter to carry her own glass of water to the table, she gets completely drenched.</p> <p>Filliozat says mealtimes are where families have the best conversations. I agree that family dinners are important, but my wife, daughter and I spend so much of our lives together, that honestly, it’s quite nice to have a moment of peace in the evening. As an experiment, I insist we all eat at 6pm. There’s a lot of cajoling involved, but it’s a nice bonding experience and I vow to make an effort to do this more often.</p> <p>Next, we try to make it through a day with our child looking immaculate. French parenting often involves clear boundaries and expectations, known as “le cadre”. The structure extends to various aspects of a child’s life, including the importance of dressing appropriately for different occasions. I brush my daughter’s hair, button her into a new dress and clean her shoes. We go to her friends’ bowling party and I feel proud that she looks so well put together at 9am on a Sunday. A few hours later, we realise she’s come home in the bowling shoes. By lunchtime, she’s wearing nothing but her pants and running round the garden with friends as we shout the word “Boundaries!!” at her.</p> <p>Finally – the moment I’ve been dreading – it’s time to try being strict. I have to warn my daughter or else she’ll be extremely confused. “Will you have a French accent?” she asks when I give her the context. “Can one Mummy still be a kind Mummy?”</p> <p>Once I give myself permission, it doesn’t take much for me to shout at her to stop faffing around and get into bed. It’s been a long day. I’m surprised by my own loud voice, and the depth of rage I normally keep in check. She starts crying, and I have to leave the room to stop myself apologising. I don’t think anyone’s learned anything from this interaction.</p> <p>Filliozat tells me that as a therapist she’s working with a number of French parents who want to stop shouting at their children. They believe there’s another way, but need help. “This discipline is coming from their past, where their parents shouted at them,” she says. “We shout because of a traumatic memory. To stop that behaviour we need to address our own trauma.”</p> <p>It’s not a great stretch to conflate the backlash to gentle parenting in France to the rise of the far right. “There’s a sense that we need to get power back,” Filliozat says. “There is a lot of insecurity. We had Covid; the economy is going down; the threat of climate change. When you feel insecure, you have a tendency to uphold what you felt was secure.” And that, she suggests, is why some French parents are now doubling down on discipline.</p> <p>I knock on my daughter’s door and apologise for shouting. It was just an experiment, I say. It didn’t work.

Having a “plan” is important to me, especially because since our children arrived life has become a lot less predictable. While I like to think of myself as a cool parent – I don’t get flustered that often, I can go with the flow – in reality I’m incredibly cautious. I’m usually within catching distance, just in case one of them falls, and immediately imagine the most terrible possible outcome when any form of danger appears. So taking on parenting tips from another country presents a real challenge.</p> <p>My guide to German parenting is Nora Imlau, a journalist who has written multiple bestselling books&nbsp;on&nbsp;the subject. Certain German concepts aren’t going to fly in Casa Bakare, though, like sharing a bed with your kids: considered normal until age seven. I&nbsp;love that for you, Germany, but at the time of the experiment, we’ve just got our 18-month-old into a consistent sleeping routine in her own room,&nbsp;and I’m not jeopardising that for anyone. Thankfully, there are non-sleep related ideas I can take on board.</p> <p>One of the cornerstones of Imlau’s German parenting guidance is not to congratulate your children. Instead I’m supposed to encourage and comment on progress without patronising them by saying such things as, “Well done, darling.” Imlau explains that the Germans try to avoid congratulations because it reinforces the idea that the parent is judging their behaviour constantly. And saying “well done” all the time renders it meaningless. “Tell them that you see what they’re doing without judging it,” says Imlau. “It’s not always about being ‘good’ or the ‘best’. You’re my beloved child because you’re you and not everything you do needs to be ranked.”</p> <p>The problem is, the week of my trial overlaps with the exact time my youngest daughter decides to start walking. While my wife begins shouting with joy as Ayobami edges closer and closer to her first fully fledged steps, I hang back, bottling up my excitement and pride while saying, “Interesting choice of footwork” and, “You are moving toward independence by moving&nbsp;your feet in that manner”, like some sort of clapped-out AI.</p> <p>Not to worry, there are other concepts I can try. Imlau tells me free-range parenting is all the rage in Germany, with a particular focus on letting kids explore. “It’s&nbsp;normal for them to be outside every day in every weather for several hours,” she tells me. It’s a case of sticking them in weather-appropriate clothing and&nbsp;letting them rip. “Of course you try to keep them safe – no one wants a kid to have a concussion,” Imlau&nbsp;adds. “But it’s also seen as a normal part of childhood, that&nbsp;they have bruised knees and get hurt, not in a severe sense, but they fall off a slide and it’s considered normal.”</p> <p>The image of my two daughters – Temilola, aged four, and Ayobami – toppling off the slide at the local park runs through my head, but I stop my waking nightmare and get them dressed. Practical attire only. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorpcore\">Gorpcore</a> for toddlers. We’re not messing around here.</p> <p>Jumping in muddy puddles is an everyday occurrence in Germany, not something you resent Peppa Pig for introducing into your life. I decide to take the girls to our local park, which backs on to a canal that plays host to a surprising amount of wildlife. It’s spitting mildly, but the inclement weather doesn’t stop us. We zip up and head out.</p> <p>At the canal, we spot a moorhen, a coot and a mallard – all of which we feed as a parakeet screeches away overhead. When I give her some bread to throw to the birds, she eats it instead, but I don’t mind, remembering Imlau’s sage advice. “Do whatever you want, enjoy your independence,” I say, even as she ignores my simple&nbsp;instructions.</p> <p>Temilola is on it, though, throwing bits of stale bread&nbsp;into the canal like the condiment-sprinkling chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/19/salt-bae-restaurant-steak-heating-nusr-et-steakhouse-profits\">Salt Bae</a>. We’re moving up and down the towpath, narrowly avoiding cyclists and the occasional jogger. To my pessimistic mind, this feels like a recipe for disaster, but as more birds come – Canada geese, pigeons and gulls&nbsp;– Temilola and Ayobami are getting increasingly excited.</p> <p>We have to head to the local cafe when Temi needs a wee (no congratulations from me, even though she gives me plenty of warning) and when we come out, there’s a heron in the middle of the towpath. A standoff begins as the giant bird refuses to move. Joggers form a queue, while Temi tentatively offers it some muesli. “It’s going to fly away with my daughter,” I say in my head, as it slowly picks at the raisins and oats before walking across the lock, allowing the joggers to file past.&nbsp;Nature is great, letting go is good. I genuinely feel as if&nbsp;I’m learning a lesson here, all thanks to my German&nbsp;friends.</p> <p>There are some key elements of German parenting that are always going to be verboten in our house (our bed is off limits, its defences only breached in absolute emergencies). But a few months on, the more relaxed attitudes to mud, play and general independence are welcome additions to my parenting repertoire. I still catch myself saying “Well done” to my daughters more often than I’d like, but Imlau’s words about how meaningless it can be definitely changed my approach to praise. “British bedtime, a more German daytime” probably sums it up well.</p> <p><strong>The dos and don’ts of parenting, German style</strong></p> <p><em><strong>D</strong></em><em><strong>O …<br></strong></em><strong>Encourage independence</strong><strong>. </strong>Nurture your child, so they feel trusted and secure, then as soon as they show they’re ready, let them go! Sleepovers from the age of three are common.</p> <p><strong>Share your bed.</strong> Many German parents co-sleep with their kids, often in a huge “family bed”, until the children are about six or seven. </p> <p><strong>Go outdoors in any weather. </strong>And not just for a walk in the park: crawling/playing in sand, on grass, in mud and puddles; climbing trees from a very young age; in rain, snow and sleet.</p> <p><em><strong>D</strong></em><em><strong>ON’T …<br></strong></em><strong>Sleep train.</strong> This is utterly frowned upon, never done at all, and is the very opposite of putting the kid’s emotional wellbeing first. </p> <p><strong>Praise. </strong>You can be positive (“I see you’ve used a lot of yellow in that picture – I like it”, for example), as long as it doesn’t veer into&nbsp;overzealousness.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>‘You only have to look at my kids’ wardrobes to see how pernicious gender stereotypes are’</strong></h2> <p><em>Tim Jonze</em><em> </em><em> warms to the Icelandic way</em><br></p>    <p>“People often completely misunderstand what we are about,” says Kristín Cardew. She works as a consultant at <a href=\"https://www.hjallimodel.com/\">Hjalli</a>, an Icelandic parenting model founded in 1989 that promotes gender equality through what they call a “structured yet unconventional method”.</p> <p>The theory is that society conditions boys and girls differently from birth, and the Hjalli model provides an environment in which to counter this. Girls are encouraged to ask more questions or leap around to help make them more assertive and adventurous; boys are taught to be more gentle and empathic by engaging in activities such as brushing each other’s hair.</p> <p>“Some say we are trying to make the boys ‘girly’,” sighs Cardew. “But we’re not taking anything away from the boys. If they want to play games which are considered ‘boys’ games’, that’s fine. What we are doing is adding things. We are trying to make our children whole people.”</p> <p>The Hjalli model’s aim seems a noble one to me. But the way of breaking down gender boundaries is counterintuitive. Rather than encourage more mixing between the genders, Hjalli separates them from as young as 12 months. They run 14 nursery schools and three secondary schools in Iceland, and Elmwood nursery school in Glasgow, in which children are taught, for most of the time, in single-sex classes. </p> <p>Doesn’t this reinforce stereotypes? Apparently not. “We call it reverse mirroring,” says Cardew. “The boys look at the girls and it reinforces how they think they shouldn’t behave. The girls see the boys maybe being a bit crazy or whatever and say, ‘I don’t want to be like that.’ So when they’re together, they’re learning how not to be. We take them apart and work to give them what traditional society deprives them of.”</p> <p>It would be unrealistic (not to mention pretty damn&nbsp;weird) to employ gender separation in our home – even if my eight-year-old daughter Romy and five-year-old son Teddy might occasionally be quite keen on the idea. But there are plenty of other things the Hjalli model proposes to prevent gender stereotypes holding kids back. These include avoiding gendered language, refraining from complimenting clothes and&nbsp;appearance, encouraging varied types of open-ended play, such as using paint and blocks, and avoiding&nbsp;punishments.</p> <p>“Punishment is never used in our schools, because we are the grownups,” says Cardew. “We are responsible for choosing a suitable environment for the children’s development and for them to flourish in it. If their reaction is questionable, we don’t shame them for it. We need to look at our own decisions and choose a better and more suitable environment for the child, so they can navigate successfully through it, socially, cognitively and emotionally.”</p> <p>This doesn’t mean bad behaviour is excused. “Some children need more assistance to practise different and more appropriate behaviour. So the teacher keeps the child closer to her (or him), at all times, to be able to intervene before the disagreeable behaviour takes place, or chooses a more suitable environment for the child to play in so that the child can practise how to cope in a more conducive manner.”</p> <p>Over the course of a few weeks, I try to adopt some of these principles into my own parenting. The good news for me is that I already do a lot of the things the Hjalli model recommends. The bad news, though, is that there are some things I just think I do already. Take the day out I spend out in Lewisham, south-east London, where my children each choose a toy in a shopping centre. Teddy, the more impulsive one, buys a rainbow handprint maker in the first shop we enter, despite my warnings that he might want to look around elsewhere first. When Romy decides to look in a shop selling cute Japanese toys, Teddy gets upset that he can’t buy anything, so I try to soothe him by saying, “Don’t worry, these things are more for girls.” I’m shocked to hear myself say it. I’ve reached for a gender stereotype as an easy way to get myself out of a tricky situation.</p> <p>You only have to look at my kids’ wardrobes to see how pernicious gender stereotypes are. Teddy’s is a shrine to various characters from the Mario and Sonic universes, whereas as I write this, Romy is wearing a pink top with Mamma Mia! printed in sparkly letters, paired with a pink bag, pink-framed glasses and a glittery skirt. Clothes are a big deal for Hjalli – their kids wear uniforms so children learn to express their identity through other means. I actually appreciate the creative expression that comes with my own kids’ non-school uniform policy, but I understand what Cardew means when she tells me I should refrain from complimenting Romy’s outfits. “Society has this terrible habit of complimenting girls for their looks all the time,” she says. “‘Oh, look at your lovely dress.’ So never compliment her on her looks, because this is how they start identifying themselves.”</p> <p>To counteract all the pink, I decide we should play a game of football in the garden. Straight away, Romy asks if she can be a cheerleader while I play with Teddy. It’s hard to know if I should be telling her not to, or letting her go with her own ideas. Ultimately, she joins&nbsp;in&nbsp;and soon she’s getting so stuck in that, were this a proper game, she’d at least be on a yellow card.</p> <p>Football is an interesting area for me. Teddy has not yet shown much interest in it: he enjoys kicking a ball around, but when things get rough, with lots of kids fighting for the ball, he tends to back away. Part of me wants to respect this, but another part remembers the huge social capital you gain from being able to play a bit of football. Should I be pushing the issue?</p> <p>“Some of the social and interactive aspects of football can be very demoralising, almost to the point of being toxic,” says Cardew, who remembers the shock of seeing her own son being yelled at while he played football. “I&nbsp;know many stories of boys being verbally bullied by their teammates and the coaches turning a blind eye. But it doesn’t have to be like this.”</p> <p>Cardew points out that a football coach has a responsibility that goes beyond simply training pupils to become good footballers. “They are also role models to these boys and partly responsible for training their behaviour as a team. Good sportsmanship could be something they focus on: fair play, positive communication, team building, how to handle winning and losing, empowering each other, managing emotions. This would serve the boys on and off the football field.”</p> <p>Indeed, my main realisation after talking to Cardew and learning about the Hjalli model is how important it is that society changes as well as our parenting. In Iceland, a law was passed in 2021 that gave both new mothers and fathers six months of paid parental leave. Cardew says the results have been astonishing, with fathers stepping up their parenting game in remarkable ways. “It has opened their eyes to the beauty of being more involved with the rearing of a child,” she says. “But you fathers in the UK have to fight for it.”</p> <p>While the few weeks I spend following Hjalli principles certainly opens my mind to aspects of parenting, it feels like their methods are constantly butting up against bigger forces. I come away thinking that only if British society becomes as progressive as Iceland when it comes to gender parity could Hjalli’s fascinating ideas have the chance to really flourish here.</p> <p><strong>The dos and don’ts of parenting, Icelandic style</strong><br></p> <p><em><strong>DO …<br></strong></em><strong>Treat both genders equally</strong>. If your son wants to paint his nails like his sister, then go for it.</p> <p><strong>Play with blocks. </strong>Build things, invent games … a simple set of building blocks is better for a child’s imagination than a structured game.</p> <p><strong>Be conscious of your language.</strong> You can reinforce stifling gender stereotypes without intending to.</p> <p><em><strong>D</strong></em><em><strong>ON’T …<br></strong></em><strong>Compliment your child’s looks. </strong>It enforces the idea that appearance is the most important aspect of their&nbsp;character.</p> <p><strong>Rub out errors.</strong> Just cross them out with a line and continue. As Cardew says: “You can’t always erase mistakes, it’s best to face them and move on.”</p> <p><strong>Punish your child. </strong>Your job as a parent is to help the child learn how best to react to difficult situations, rather than shame them.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>‘</strong><strong>My favourite piece of advice that encapsulates traditional Polish parenting</strong><strong>? Wear a hat!’</strong></h2> <p><em>Chitra Ramaswamy</em><em> tries the Polish method</em><br></p>    <p>The key to successful parenting, says Aga Rogala, is talking about emotions – and not just those of the child. “Polish parents tend to think if a child is happy, it means they’re good parents,” says the Polish parent therapist, podcaster and author of a book of parenting advice called Poukładaj to sobie w głowie (Sort it Out in Your Head). “And if they’re not happy, something’s wrong with their parenting.” Clearly this is ridiculous: a child is not a machine into which you input the correct data and get the same results each time. And yet. The truth is I commit this classic parental sin all the time.</p> <p>Take my 11-year-old autistic son. When he’s settled, happy, and his needs are being met, I am settled, happy (and obviously none of my needs are being met). When he is anxious, stressed, or, in his own unique turn of phrase, “not having a nice feeling”, I, too, am very much not having a nice feeling. Time and time again I tell myself: do not predicate your happiness on the happiness of your child. That way lies … turbulence. But I can’t help myself. I want him to be happy. I’m his&nbsp;mum.</p> <p>Rogala reckons the most meaningful thing I can do, as the mother of my son and seven-year-old neurotypical daughter, is “really feel the weight of it all … examine how you’re coping with the burden of questions like, ‘Am I doing this right? Have I taken care of everything? Do they have healthy relationships?’” A series of questions that hits like a line of strategically placed Lego bricks beneath my tired bare feet. Yikes! Now I’m really not having a nice feeling.</p> <p>“Parents try to keep all their ‘bad emotions’ inside them, not talk about them, not even make some safe space to express them with their partner,” continues Rogala, who runs workshops with parents across Poland. “It’s always like you’re trying to repress it in yourself. So many mothers cry to me, ‘Oh, I’m screaming at my child, I feel terrible. I’m a terrible mother.’”</p> <p>The style of parenting she sees most in her work is an amped-up helicopter/tiger hybrid that will be all too familiar to middle-class parents in many countries. “It’s like we don’t try to have a perfect child any more. We try to be perfect parents. We think we have to be everywhere in our children’s lives. We can’t let them solve any problems on their own. We put huge pressure on them to get good grades.” It sounds so stressful. “This is why Polish parents are some of the most burnt-out in Europe,” she agrees. “The Polish parenting style is&nbsp;exhausting.”</p> <p>Rogala, who was born in 1982, thinks the prevalence of this method is a reaction to the way her generation was parented under communism. Or rather, not parented. “My early childhood took place in the last period of communism and the first years of the new era. It was very, very difficult for our parents. They had to struggle with many problems, the economy crashing and mass unemployment, and were mostly absent. We are the generation who grew up with keys around our necks because our parents were always working or queueing, never at home to let us in after school. Many of us were quite alone as children. Our parents were exhausted. Many had no idea how to talk to us about feelings. When you have to survive, there’s no room for such things. So now, they have decided to be very present. It’s not the answer to the problems of parenting. The reality is there is no answer.” Which is probably the greatest, most border-crossing piece of parenting advice of all. </p> <p>How would she describe her own parenting style? “The Polish name for it is <em>kocham i wymagam</em>’, which means ‘I love and I set boundaries’,” Rogala says. Her children are 16, 14, and eight, and house rules include eating dinner as a family with no phones or TV. Her two eldest children have phones which activate at 7am and shut down at 9pm; they’re not allowed TikTok and her 14-year-old daughter doesn’t, by choice, use social media. Saturdays are cleaning days with everyone involved. Rogala doesn’t supervise homework and the older kids go to their rooms around 10pm but go to bed when they want. She reads her youngest a book at bedtime and strokes his back as he falls asleep.</p> <p>Some of this, like following established routines at mealtimes and bedtimes, is similar to what goes down in my home in Edinburgh. Much of it is not. Rogala says family meals at the dinner table, particularly on Sundays with grandparents, are enshrined in Polish culture. In our house, my son’s autism means he has to eat alone at the table so my partner Claire, our daughter and I often eat in the sitting room in front of the telly. Which brings me to the fundamental issue I’ve had with parenting advice since my son got his diagnosis aged four. It never seems to apply to those of us raising autistic children. Or children with any additional needs. Or, for that matter, queer parents. In Poland, the adoption of children by same-sex couples has been banned, and, unsurprisingly, Rogala has never worked with LGBTQI+ parents in her workshops.</p> <p>My son has pretty much unlimited access to his screen, which is hard for his sister, who is allowed an hour a day, supervised, on her tablet. But he needs it to regulate, communicate and feed his brain’s insatiable appetite for whatever his special interests happen to be. This time last year, that was Lewis Capaldi singing Forever. Now it’s train announcements on the line between Edinburgh and Glenrothes with Thornton, and Paddington Bear drinking mouthwash. I often think we’re the ones who should be doing the advising, because parents of autistic children have been ruthlessly trained in the sacred parental arts of patience, empathy, humour and creative problem-solving. We’re constantly rewriting the manual, rolling with the punches (often literally), and trying to solve the latest ultra-niche problem.</p> <p>As for pieces of advice that encapsulate traditional Polish parenting, my favourite has to be … wear a hat. I do live in Scotland, after all. Apparently this is a command addressed to children of any age, at any time of year, by Polish grandparents down the ages. What else? “Tell your children not to run or break a sweat.” Rogala says there’s a fear, again passed on from grandparents, that strenuous activity makes children sick. This one pleases my daughter immensely, what with her being a homebody who embraces pyjama days the way my son does level crossings. “Oh, and we are very much afraid of … what is the word? When you open the window …” Erm, fresh air? “No, a blast of wind! It&nbsp;will make them ill!” The solution, we agree, once again lies in wearing a hat.</p> <p>Fundamentally, Rogala believes parenting is not about swinging on a pendulum between extremes. “In&nbsp;Poland it’s either, ‘I’m doing great, I’m a good parent’ or, ‘I do everything wrong, I’m a terrible parent’ and there’s nothing in between. To me, the solutions are all in the in between.”</p> <p><strong>The dos and don’ts of parenting, Polish style</strong></p> <p><em><strong>DO …<br></strong></em><strong>Make space at the weekend, especially on a Sunday, for a big family meal.</strong> Invite as many generations as possible, especially grandparents.

At the time I was experiencing a degree of sloth I decided to dress up as indignation: I emailed back saying I knew nothing of so-called bin shoes, that I had one pair of stout boots that served me in all circumstances.</p> <p>This was more or less true – I’m on my sixth pair of identical pull-on ankle boots, which suit both formal and informal occasions, and all seasons. I&nbsp;wear them on long hikes, even though I probably shouldn’t, and I slip them on late at night, without socks, when I have forgotten to put out the bins.</p> <p>Of course I do own other shoes, including some classic branded trainers that were deeply fashionable when I was nine, but which my mother would not buy me, presenting me instead with suspect lookalikes.</p> <p>“They’re supposed to have three stripes,” I said. “These have four.”</p> <p>“A bonus stripe,” my mother said.</p> <p>“These are bobos,” I said, using my peer group’s common slang for cheap knock-off trainers.</p> <p>“What’s the difference?” she said.</p> <p>The difference, I explained, was that when I went to school in them the other children would gather round me and sing “Bobos, they make your feet feel fine/Bobos, they cost a dollar ninety-nine…” to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. My mother thought this was hilarious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When I go to leave the house I find a single pair of black boots by the front door: one size 8½, the other a 10</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anyway, last autumn my middle son let it be known that his work shoes had worn out, and that he was seeking an all-purpose footwear solution.</p> <p>“What about Dad’s boots?” my wife said. The middle one leaned over the kitchen table to examine my feet.</p> <p>“They’re very versatile,” I said.</p> <p>“Yeah, maybe,” he said, frowning a little.</p> <p>“I’ve worn these babies to funerals,” I said. “And I’ve worn them to the beach.”</p> <p>In spite of his reservations, my wife bought him a pair. He was so pleased with them that she gave our other two sons a pair each for Christmas. For a short period I considered myself an intergenerational influencer, before the trouble started.</p> <p>The first time it happens I’m on my&nbsp;way to the shops when I notice something disquieting about my gait. I&nbsp;feel graceless, rackety and slow. It’s just age, I tell myself, but I’m still out of sorts when I reach the front door, where I am greeted by the middle one standing in his socks.</p> <p>“Are you wearing my boots?” he says.</p> <p>“No,” I say looking down.</p> <p>“Yes, you are,” he says, “and I need to go&nbsp;to Birmingham.”</p> <p>“Wow, they really are identical,” I&nbsp;say. “Actually I did notice something weird when I …”</p> <p>“Take them off,” he says.</p> <p>Weeks later the oldest one moves back home, and promptly sets off for work in my boots, leaving me his size 10s, which fall off when I walk.</p> <p>“Didn’t they feel tight to you?” I say when he comes home that evening.</p> <p>“They did, yeah,” he says. “What are they, like size 8?”</p> <p>“8½,” I say. “I’m actually a 9, but I&nbsp;know from experience they run big.”</p> <p>A week after that I’m late for a recording session with the band I’m in.&nbsp;When I go to leave the house I find a&nbsp;single pair of black boots by the front door: one 8½, one 10.</p> <p>“He hasn’t,” I say. But evidently he has. Coincidentally, the day before my classic branded trainers had split a seam, so the toe of the right one hung open, slack-jawed. I can’t wear those, I&nbsp;think. Nor can I wear two boots of markedly different sizes, even though my son apparently can.</p> <p>Upstairs in my cupboard I find a pair of Slovakian canvas sneakers my wife once bought me. There is, I think, nothing else for it.</p> <p>As we sit in the recording studio listening to the drummer add extra cymbal crashes to a track, the guitar player turns and looks me over.</p> <p>“This is a new style for you, isn’t it?” he says. I look down at myself. I have on a densely patterned half-sleeved shirt I found in my holiday luggage, and shoes that might accurately be described as bobos.</p> <p>“You appear to think of me as someone who doesn’t have summer looks,” I say, “but I have summer looks.”</p> <p>“I wasn’t criticising,” he says.</p> <p>“I’ve got lightweight knits,” I say. “I’ve got structured linens. ”</p> <p>My phone pings – my oldest son’s reply to my recent text. “I’m wearing trainers,” he writes. “All the boots are in the house.”</p> <p>As I look down at my feet an ancient tune threads through my head: “Bobos, they’re made for hoboes, so get your bobos for hoboes today.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Cans and bottles of beer, wine and spirits should explicitly warn drinkers that alcohol causes cancer, an unprecedented alliance of doctors, charities and public experts have said.</p> <p>Warning labels would tackle “shockingly low” public awareness in the UK that alcohol is <a href=\"https://www.wcrf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HI-Alcohol-Factsheet-2023-WEB.pdf\">proven to cause seven forms of cancer</a> and 17,000 cases a year of the disease, they claim.</p> <p>Dozens of medical and health organisations have written to Keir Starmer urging him to take the radical step of compelling alcohol producers to include such warnings in order to improve public health. The labels must be “bold and unambiguous”, said the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which coordinated the letter.</p> <p>“The evidence is clear: health labelling on alcoholic drinks is urgently needed in the UK to help save lives,” it said. “They should carry strong, clear messages about the health risks, which include the risk of cancer, far beyond vague advice like ‘consume in moderation’.”</p> <p>Kate Oldridge-Turner, the WCRF’s head of policy and public affairs, said: “Providing alcohol warning labels would empower millions to make informed choices by clearly understanding the risks.”</p> <p>Evidence cited by charities such as the WCRF and Cancer Research UK shows that alcohol increases the risk of breast, bowel, stomach, head, neck, liver and mouth cancer.</p> <p>Ireland is to become the first country in the world to include cancer warning labels on alcoholic products. From next May, alcohol sold in the republic will have to carry a warning that “there is a direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers”. The labels will also warn that drinking can cause liver disease and affect foetuses.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, the chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, <a href=\"https://ahauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Our-manifesto-updated-1.pdf\">urged the UK to follow suit</a>. He said: “We must look to the fearless work of our neighbours in Ireland whose new labelling policy provides a level playing field for all producers, leaving no room for loopholes or hiding information behind QR codes or tiny print.</p> <p>“Improved alcohol labelling, including clear health warnings about the link to cancer, is not just a public health measure, it’s a fundamental consumer right. People deserve to know the risks so they can make informed choices about their health. But current labels and weak regulations are keeping drinkers in the dark.”</p> <p>The drinks industry dismissed the call and said warnings would make drinkers anxious. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Portman Group, a drinks industry-funded body that oversees alcohol labelling in the UK, said: “Whilst we do not dispute the link between alcohol and certain cancers, and that drinking at harmful levels is dangerous and increases risks, blanket cancer warning labels are not a proportionate policy measure and do not put the risks into an appropriate context.</p> <p>“This can create unnecessary anxiety, eroding trust in health advice and alienating the very people who require support.”</p> <p>The spokesperson said most alcohol products already included advice from the chief medical officers of the UK’s four home nations to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. “Most people already drink within this guidance, which means their risks for associated diseases are low”, they said.</p> <p>In February, the World Health Organization’s European office <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/14-02-2025-alcohol-labels-should-warn-of-cancer-risk--says-new-who-europe-report\">declared</a>: “Clear and prominent health warning labels on alcohol, which include a specific cancer warning, are a cornerstone of the right to health.” </p> <p>In a report, it urged governments to introduce them to help reduce alcohol-related harm and raise awareness of the link between drinking and cancer.</p> <p>Dr Gauden Galea, a WHO adviser, said in the report that policymakers should “resist all the pressure that will inevitably come from commercial actors” who claim such warnings do not work.</p> <p>In January, Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general under the then president, Joe Biden, said cancer warning labels were needed because drinking led to about 100,000 cancer diagnoses a year in the US. It was the third most common preventable cause of cancer after tobacco and obesity, he added.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Drinking alcohol increases the risk of a range of health issues, including several cancers. That is why we recommend people drink within the UK chief medical officer’s alcohol guidelines of fewer than 14 units a week, and strongly recommend these are displayed clearly on all alcohol products.</p> <p>“We recognise the need for more action on the impact of alcohol on health; for too long there has been an unwillingness to lead on this issue. Our plan for change will shift healthcare towards prevention, including through early intervention, to support people to live longer, healthier lives across the UK.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>“It’s 1938 and Iran is Germany … The Jewish people will not allow a second Holocaust.” Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, recited slogans like these<strong> </strong>incessantly for decades, urging action against the gravest threat to the Jewish state – a nuclear-armed Iran. He conveyed the message to successive US presidents. He presented a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/binyamin-netanyahu-cartoon-bomb-un\">bomb cartoon at the UN</a>. At countless Holocaust memorial events he described Iran’s nuclear ambitions as the present-day “final solution”.</p> <p>Netanyahu talked and talked about the pressing Iranian threat, but his listeners were not convinced. They dismissed him as an alarmist whose deadline Iran crossed year after year without deploying a nuclear weapon (it still hasn’t). Netanyahu’s critics at home taunted him as a chicken who would never dare to attack Iran’s nuclear installations – unlike his more decisive predecessors, who had ordered the bombing of nuclear reactors in Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>Everything changed on Friday 13 June.</p> <p>At 3am local time, Israelis were woken by an urgent alert from the Home Front Command, ordering us to stay near our safe rooms or bomb shelters. Shortly after, an official announcement told us that Israel had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-netanyahu\">attacked Iran’s nuclear plants</a> and air defences, and assassinated its top military brass and nuclear scientists. When the night came, a barrage of Iranian missiles hit Tel Aviv and its outskirts. The exchanges of bombs, drones and missiles have continued ever since, causing more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/20/israel-iran-war-live-updates-geneva-talks-trump-khamenei-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-6854b94a8f0838901d82e632#block-6854b94a8f0838901d82e632\">260 civilian deaths</a> in Iran and 24 in Israel, and inflicting considerable damage.</p> <p>To Netanyahu and his followers, 13 June is the big vindication. An opportunity to rewrite his legacy, which has been<strong> </strong>marred by his failure to prevent the disaster of 7 October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping 250 hostages to Gaza, and igniting a devastating war that is still going on. The prime minister ignored warnings of imminent war while pushing autocracy, then blamed the security services, spreading excuses and conspiracy theories only his diehard supporters believed.</p> <p>The ensuing Gaza war did little to boost Netanyahu’s leadership credentials. Even after Israel had killed more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/israeli-forces-kill-at-least-60-palestinians-seeking-food-aid-in-gaza-health-officials-say\">55,000 Palestinians</a> it failed to achieve the “ultimate victory” pledged by the prime minister. Hamas, however decimated, is still in charge, and 53 Israeli hostages – 20 of them believed to be alive – are still in captivity. To many around the world, Netanyahu’s name is synonymous with mass murder. Even in Israel, anti-war sentiment began to rise after he broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March. </p> <p>Attacking Iran, however, is far more consensual in Israel. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute released on Thursday showed 82% of Jewish respondents – including 57% who consider themselves leftwing – <a href=\"https://en.idi.org.il/articles/59726\">support the decision</a> to attack Iran. Among Arab respondents, 11% support and 65% oppose striking Iran.</p> <p>To Israelis, Iran is the ultimate, scariest enemy. Since the revolution in 1979, it has been preaching the destruction of the “Zionist regime”. Over the years it built and armed a “ring of fire” around Israel, led by the Lebanese Hezbollah and its arsenal of rockets and missiles. In recent years, Iran and its allies contemplated a plan to destroy Israel through a combination of cross-border invasion and pinpoint missile attacks. But on 7 October Hamas acted alone, enabling Israel to regroup and hit its enemies one by one.</p> <p>Last autumn, the “ring of fire” collapsed. Israel defeated Hezbollah and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah\">killed its leader</a>, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, took out Iran’s key air defences, and watched the Syrian Assad regime, Iran’s oldest regional ally, collapse overnight. Tehran’s skies were now open to Israeli bombers, just like Gaza’s, and rising voices called on Netanyahu to fulfil his lifelong mission and attack Iran – including the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, his apparent rival in the next election.</p> <p>Military opportunity notwithstanding, the turning point in Israel’s war planning was Donald Trump’s second coming to the White House. Netanyahu believed he could extract an unprecedented green light to hit the uranium-enrichment and missile plants in Iran. Israel’s military top brass was reluctant to act without the US consent that had never arrived. With Trump back in office, Netanyahu overcame his doubts. The Americans were aware of the war preparations in Israel. But Trump had bad news for Netanyahu. He opted for negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran, seven years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/iranian-hardliners-rejoice-over-us-nuclear-deal-exit\">he had ditched</a> Barack Obama’s agreement under Netanyahu’s prodding. The Israeli leader postponed the operation, only to launch it when Trump’s 60-day deadline to Tehran expired. From Netanyahu’s perspective, Trump’s support for the attack – however <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/trump-iran-israel-attacks-response\">lukewarm at first</a> – has been the peak diplomatic achievement of his career.</p> <p>To many Israelis, the successful first strike echoed Israel’s greatest military victory, the six-day war of 1967. American analysts were quick to declare Israel the new regional hegemon. Even as millions of Israelis were running to their shelters several times a day, Netanyahu and the IDF leadership exuded euphoria, all but eager to erase their 7 October disaster and the Gaza quicksand. They raised high expectations for direct US intervention – needed to destroy Iran’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/us-military-assets-missile-launch-sites-iran-fordow\">underground nuclear plant</a> – and for regime change in Tehran, threatening the assassination of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/20/middle-east-trump-stopped-war-uk-us-iraq\">We’re on the brink of a disastrous, illegal conflagration in the Middle East. Trump must be stopped | Fawaz Gerges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Netanyahu, who was drafted to IDF special forces shortly after the six-day war, should have known the dire lessons of 1967: bragging leads to complacency, which leads to disaster – as happened in 1973, when Egypt and Syria fought back. Brilliant tactical moves are no guarantee for victory, as they morph into mission creep and indecisive attrition. Israel’s success in rolling back Iran’s nuclear programme is still unclear, but conducting a “war of cities” between Tehran and Tel Aviv will be clearly devastating.</p> <p>The first days of his Iranian campaign brought Netanyahu a moment of relief from his political troubles. His corruption trial, where he is facing cross-examination, is postponed. Opposition leaders applauded his decision to attack Iran. And the 7 October reruns and stories about the hostages, constant reminders of Netanyahu’s failure, are off primetime television.</p> <p>Yet true to form, Netanyahu is showing no interest in reconciliation with his real or imaginary rivals. On the contrary, he appears to view his new heroic credentials as a means to double down on his race to turn Israel into a theocratic autocracy, a Hebrew-speaking version of Iran. His critics were hardly surprised when, visiting a bombed hospital in Beersheba, he spoke of his family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/netanyahu-son-wedding-comments-israel-backlash\">paying the “cost” of war</a>, having had to postpone his younger son’s wedding. To them it was another example of his condescending detachment from the plight of ordinary Israelis. His critics dismiss the decision to attack Iran as politically motivated and careless. They are a minority, according to a Channel 13 poll released on Wednesday, in which 64% of respondents <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahus-likud-party-gains-strength-since-start-of-war-poll/#:~:text=A%20majority%20of%20respondents%20%E2%80%94%2064%25%20%E2%80%94%20say%20they%20believe%20Netanyahu%20launched%20the%20war%20to%20eliminate%20Iran%E2%80%99s%20nuclear%20program%20and%20ballistic%20missiles%2C%20and%2028%25%20say%20Netanyahu%20was%20motivated%20by%20domestic%20politics.\">believed that Netanyahu</a> truly wants to rid Israel of Iran’s nukes and missiles, and only 28% attributed political motives to his war decision. But their support for the destruction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/iran-nuclear-sites-natanz-isfahan-fordow-israel-attack\">Natanz and Fordow</a>, and even of getting rid of Iran’s rulers, was not translated to an intention to vote for the current coalition, which remains unpopular.</p> <p>Netanyahu’s vindication, apparently, would take much more than bombing sorties over Iran.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aluf Benn is the editor-in-chief of Haaretz</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>Last month, we made a choice on the farm in the midst of the spring drought. The grass was going to seed, risking the quality and amount of hay we could produce. We decided to “top” the meadows early and hope for rain rather than settling for a poor crop.</p> <p>So far, it’s paying off. There has been rain, and the grass, stimulated by mowing, is at last swaying in the breeze. A late hay harvest now looks possible.</p> <p>The drought, paradoxically, has brought a benefit. The grasses, so often dominant, have been suppressed, giving wildflowers a head start. The grazing pastures are no longer monocultures. This year, as horses swish flies, the fields are full of oxeye daisies, creating a landscape as bucolic as an Alfred&nbsp;Munnings painting. Also paying off is my prediction of a bumper orchid year. Wading through the wildflower meadows, I find bee orchid after bee orchid. Each has a pale pink, three-petalled flower with what looks like a fuzzy brown and yellow bee resting on it.</p>    <p>If this were southern Europe, a species called the long-horn bee would think this was a female, misled not just by appearance but by the mimicry of pheromones. He’d have a go at mating. Whether the male ever realises he’s been tricked into “pseudo-copulation” with a fake bee I don’t know, but either way, he has pollinated the plant. In the UK, the long-horn is so rare that the bee orchids self-pollinate.</p> <p>Then I start finding pyramidal orchids everywhere in the meadow. On top of each long stem is a flower spike, packed full of tiny, delicate individual flowers. Each has that distinctive orchid shape, varying in colour from light pink to strong purple. These ones are such bright magenta they almost glow, and will be pollinated by long-tongued butterflies, and hawk moths, whose proboscis can reach 25mm long.</p> <p>I pick a handful of the sainfoin fronds – loved by horses, naturally anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic – and return to the stables where the leaves are gratefully munched. In the eaves, the baby swallows are also open mouthed, gaping and calling as the parent swoops in with food. I found a chick dead on the ground this morning, but three remain, looking more ready to fledge each day.</p> <p>• Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 15% discount</p>",

            "body" : "<p>There are musicals, and then there’s Cats. Andew Lloyd Webber’s show is often the one held up as a bewildering example by non-believers. People dress as cats in leg-warmers and sing children’s poems, and it’s a hit? The baffling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQF-aOwkMmY&amp;ab_channel=InsideEdition\">body horror</a> of the 2019 film didn’t do much for the show’s image, either. It was the 80s, loyalists say, it was a different time!</p> <p>But Cats is back, and theatre producers would prefer we just buy a ticket and live in the past. Cats is perhaps best now as a fond memory, where you can forgive its wilted structure, stop-start pacing and tired stereotyping (don’t even try to count how often a female cat is there to sigh and swoon over a male one). There, you can enjoy how the score is drenched in 80s synth and peppered with pastiche, with hints of jazz, music hall, rock and a little opera (one of Lloyd Webber’s great loves); it is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEIiqhx3BSk&amp;ab_channel=CatsTheMusical\">catchy as all get-out.</a> Memory, the plaintive cri de coeur by fading glamour cat Grizabella, was a genuine chart hit, lingering in jewellery boxes and hold music. And Gillian Lynne’s original choreography, oddly sexy and determinedly feline, lives on in plenty of giggly shared stories between friends of sexual awakenings and Rum Tum Tugger.</p>    <p>To bring it back, unchanged – as is happening now in Sydney – feels like a return to the worst of the megamusicals craze: cashing in on a known quantity even after its cultural cachet has faded. The production now playing at Sydney’s Theatre Royal is a 40th anniversary celebration of the first time the musical made it to Australia (featuring Debra Byrne, Marina Prior, and John Wood) and it’s like time has stopped. There are no surprises. It’s even back in the same theatre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jun/20/the-door-in-question-vr-xr-immersive-experience-melbourne-metro-west-footscray\">Inside a deserted Melbourne shopping mall is a bizarre XR journey into psychosis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are a few joyful moments – the best of them featuring Axel Alvarez, who plays “the magical” Mr Mistoffelees, the cat with a light-up coat who delivers his magic through ballet, including a dazzling number of fouettés. His astonishing ease and classical technique is the very best of what Cats can be. Mark Vincent is perhaps at his stage best as the beloved Jellicle leader Old Deuteronomy, Tom Davis is a joyful, all-in Skimbleshanks (that’s the railway cat), Todd McKenney pleasingly hams it up Gus the Theatre Cat, and Gabriyel Thomas, tears in her eyes as she sang Memory, earned ringing cheers as Grizabella.</p>    <p>The cast and creative team are producing beautiful work – those full-ensemble dance formations brought forth applause every time the cast found themselves moving together as one – but what a shame it’s all in service to the same old Cats, which can’t hide its flaws with novelty any more.</p> <p>Even worse is that you’d never know it in Australia, but internationally, Lloyd Webber – who the Pulitzer-winning <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2023/03/andrew-lloyd-webber-phantom-of-the-opera-closing.html\">critic Andrea Long Chu described</a> as the force that “set Broadway on its current path of chintzy commercial nihilism” – is facing a generational shift. Cats lasted in the West End for 21 years and Phantom on Broadway for 35 – and the artists who grew up with these silly, thrilling works are mining them for new meaning and contemporary beats, testing how much they can speak to this moment.</p>    <p>In the UK, Lloyd Webber’s Starlight Express (about trains – it is Cats on roller-skates) has returned in a completely new production – with the train Greaseball now played by a woman with<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pIVhBCG2tE&amp;ab_channel=MogalTae\"> queer undertones</a>.

            "body" : "<p>Earlier this year, Serhiy Serdiuk was deported from Russia, along with his wife and daughter. He was given a 40-year ban from re-entering the country.</p> <p>Serdiuk’s home town of Komysh-Zoria, in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, was part of the territory occupied in the first weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion in spring 2022. According to Moscow, it is now part of Russia. And because Serdiuk, the headteacher of a local school, refused to work for the new authorities, they decided he had no place living there.</p> <p>“I was born there, I’ve lived my whole life there, in the same place,” said Serdiuk, in a recent interview in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the regional capital still controlled by Kyiv, where he now lives. “Now I am kicked out of my own home and told I didn’t live in the country I thought I lived in? How is this possible?”</p> <p>The deportation of Serdiuk and his family is part of a continuing “cleansing” operation of the occupied territories, which may accelerate if US-led attempts to push Russia and Ukraine into a peace deal result in the freezing of the current frontlines, solidifying Russian control over the territory Moscow has seized over the past three years.</p>    <p>In the early months of the invasion, Russian forces used lists to identify potentially troublesome pro-Ukrainian members of society in the occupied territories. Many were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/inside-taganrog-beatings-electrocution-and-starvation-at-prison-where-ukrainians-were-tortured\">kidnapped, tortured and held in Russian jails</a>. Perhaps wary of the cost and resources required to jail thousands more people, authorities have now employed a new tactic.</p> <p>“There were cases when they just came to people and said, ‘It’s in your interests to disappear from here, or we’ll have to take you to the basement,’ and then people left by themselves,” Serdiuk recalled.</p>    <p>But in his case and some others the authorities did not leave it to chance. Ivan Fedorov, the governor of Zaporizhzhia region, estimated that “hundreds” of people had been deported from the occupied part of the region in recent months. Vladimir Putin signed a decree in March that stipulates “Ukrainian citizens who have no legal basis for living in the Russian Federation are obliged to leave” by 10 September, or take Russian citizenship. </p> <p>Serdiuk was born in Komysh-Zoria, a small town home to around 2,000 people, and had lived there his whole life, except for a few years studying in nearby Berdiansk. He started working at the local school, which had about 240 pupils, in 1999, beginning as a maths teacher and in 2018 being made headteacher.</p>    <p>Komysh-Zoria was occupied, without major fighting, in the first days of the full-scale invasion, and by April 2022, the new Russian authorities called a meeting of the school’s 30 teachers, demanding that they open the school and teach the Russian curriculum. Serdiuk refused, and most of the teachers followed suit.</p> <p>In the ensuing weeks, Russian soldiers came to Serdiuk’s home and tried to persuade him to open the school. First, they were polite. Then, the threats started: “If you don’t want all your employees to have house searches, tell them to go to work.” One PE teacher agreed to work for the Russians immediately, but most of the others held out, he said. His school remains closed, and students now attend schools in one of two nearby towns.</p> <p>“I told them I’d never work for them and I kept to that,” said Serdiuk. For three years, he sat at home, unemployed, as Russian control solidified over the region.</p> <p>At the end of 2023, Serdiuk was told that he and his family would be deported. They were given three days to prepare, and packed their possessions into a few suitcases, but then were left waiting for more than a month. Their passports had been seized so they could not leave of their own volition. Eventually, at the end of January, they were driven to the regional capital of Melitopol and then put in a minibus with another family. Each deportee was sat on a pair of seats, handcuffed to a guard sitting beside them.</p> <p>The minibus drove for 20 hours until it reached the mountainous border between Russia and Georgia. Two drivers took turns at the wheel. At the border, the Ukrainians were handed back their passports and told to cross to the Georgian side. Serdiuk and his wife were given a 40-year ban from Russian territory; his 21-year-old daughter was given 50 years.</p> <p>From Georgia, they flew to Moldova, then back into Ukraine and all the way to Zaporizhzhia, to arrive at a spot around 90 miles (140km) away from their homes. Serdiuk is now teaching private maths lessons in the city, and plans to find a job at a local school. “At least here I can talk normally and not be scared of every passing car,” he said.</p>    <p>But the forced deportation brings with it a lot of pain, most notably that he had to leave behind his mother, who has advanced dementia, in occupied territory. Before 2022, she had been taking medication to slow the progression of the condition, but after the invasion the family was unable to get the pills and the effect was swift and devastating.</p> <p>“She can talk and walk but she can’t look after herself. It required constant vigilance, otherwise she would slip out of the house and walk back to the house where she was born,” said Serdiuk. When notice of the deportation came, Serdiuk drove his mother to his sister’s house and bade her farewell. He does not know if he will ever see her again.</p>    <p>During a long interview, Serdiuk used humour and sarcasm to offset the depressing reality, but the one time he became visibly emotional was when asked for his thoughts on possible plans to freeze the frontlines as part of a peace settlement.</p> <p>The idea is something being pushed by the US, and many in Ukraine also support this, feeling that a temporary respite would be better than continuing the grinding, bloody fight. For Serdiuk, however, it would mean an unacceptable sacrifice. “How could I support this? How could I say that it’s fine that I was pushed out of my home and can’t go back?”</p> <p>He also fears for his former pupils. While Russia has sent in new teachers to the occupied areas, Serdiuk said this mainly concerned bigger cities. In the small settlements of his district, most of the teachers remained local, he said, and might be trying to avoid some of the harsher aspects of the new Russian curriculum. However, he said that with the pressure to conform to the needs of the new authorities, the respite would only be temporary.</p> <p>“They are demanding that there are portraits of Putin on the walls, that the children draw pictures and write wishes for their soldiers,” he said. “This all breaks the psychological balance of a child. A year ago we lived in Ukraine, and now Ukraine is bad and we are drawing pictures of our liberators? If we freeze this conflict, then in two or three years these children will already be lost.”</p>",

The prospecting has sparked resistance from residents who fear the mines will foul the soil, drain the water and fill the air with the rumbling thunder of heavy trucks.</p> <p>“They are destroying everything,” said Gomes, who runs the only cafe in the village with his partner. “They are taking our peace.”</p> <p>Covas do Barroso is among the first villages caught up in Europe’s efforts to green its economy. As the continent weans itself off fossil fuels that poison the air and heat the planet, demand for lithium is surging, to build batteries that can run electric vehicles and balance renewable-heavy power grids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/10/thousands-of-serbians-protest-in-belgrade-against-lithium-mine\">Thousands of Serbians protest in Belgrade against lithium mine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across Europe, people living near lithium deposits appear unconvinced that mines will bring good jobs and are unmoved by pleas to stop a bigger ecological threat. Attempts to push projects through in the face of local resistance have been met with cries of “colonialism”.</p> <p>In Serbia, broad swathes of society have taken to the streets over the past year to protest against a lithium mine planned for the Jadar valley. In France, a lithium mine planned beneath a kaolin quarry in Allier has alarmed activists and divided residents. In Covas do Barroso, in northern Portugal, people say their village – at the heart of a heritage farming region recognised by the United Nations – has been turned into a “sacrifice zone”.</p> <p>“You’re talking about destroying an area that has been classified as a globally important agricultural heritage site, an example of sustainability, an area with a system of water management that is at least over 500 years old,” said Catarina Alves Scarrott, a member of the protest group Unidos em Defesa de Covas do Barroso (UDCB). “You’re going to sacrifice all of this for open-pit mines. And then, you start to ask: for what?”</p> <p>The answer, for EU officials and the Portuguese government, is to obtain a soft white metal that is needed to stop burning fuels that make extreme weather dramatically worse – and do so without relying exclusively on foreign suppliers. Europe produces almost no lithium itself. More than three-quarters of the world’s raw supply comes from just three countries: Australia, Chile and China. The latter dominates the refined supply of lithium too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/05/lithium-chart/giv-32554YPob37fPTrl0/\" data-alt=\"A chart showing the world’s top lithium-producing countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/05/lithium-chart/giv-32554YPob37fPTrl0/\">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Guardian graphic</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anxious about energy security and scrambling to get more mines dug at home, the European Commission set a target last year of meeting 10% of demand for critical raw materials from domestic sources by 2030. In March, it listed the planned mine in Covas as one of 47 strategic mineral projects that would benefit from “coordinated support” to become operational. The decision is being challenged by MiningWatch Portugal, ClientEarth and UDCB, which lodged a complaint with the commission in June.</p> <p>Environmental concerns about waste and water are not the only factors that have left communities such as Covas wary of prospectors. Kwasi Ampofo, a metals and mining analyst at BloombergNEF, said the sales pitch had been made harder by the mining industry’s historically poor reputation for safety and the lack of skilled domestic labour forces to profit from the work.</p> <p>“It’s going to be very hard for the EU to develop primary sources of lithium domestically,” he said. “Not impossible, but very hard.”</p> <p>In Covas, the long-running struggle between villagers and miners has intensified as political support for the project has grown. The Portuguese environment ministry granted the British mining company Savannah Resources a one-year “administrative easement” in December that allows it to prospect in the land around Covas. The villagers filed an injunction that held up the process, but the ministry quickly allowed work to resume, arguing it was in the public interest.</p> <p>People in the village, where a tattered banner declares “no to the mine, yes to life”, say they feel misled by the miners and betrayed by the government. They accuse the company of trespassing on land it does not own – much of which is held in common ownership – and downplaying the nature and scale of the project. But opinions in the surrounding Boticas region are mixed, with some hopeful the project will boost a neglected rural economy.</p> <p>Savannah Resources declined to comment. It has previously told local media it is acting within the law and makes efforts to keep people informed. It projects the mine will produce enough lithium for half a million EV batteries a year and describes itself as “enabling Europe’s energy transition”.</p> <p>But the continent-wide resistance to lithium mining reveals a snag that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/26/second-nature-exhibition-anthropocene-photography\">green groups</a> and mining companies alike have been reluctant to acknowledge.

For the lithium that does need to be extracted, harvesting it from brine does less damage to the environment than mining it from rocks.</p> <p>But with 250m combustion engine cars on EU roads and next to no lithium produced at home, electrifying vehicle fleets without domestic sources of lithium would still mean extracting more abroad. Analysts fear this would largely take place in regions with weaker environment and human rights laws.</p> <p>“It’s not necessarily a dilemma with no exit, but it’s a real one,” said Thea Riofrancos, a political scientist at Providence College who visited Covas and several others mining regions when writing a book about lithium extraction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/15/uk-urged-not-to-exploit-poor-countries-in-rush-for-critical-minerals\">UK urged not to exploit poor countries in rush for critical minerals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mines were most likely to face resistance from people when developers failed to include them in the decision-making process, she added.</p> <p>“It’s not the environmental risks or the water risks on their own – if they’re not combined with a sense of exclusion, then oftentimes those don’t in and of themselves cause protests,” she said. “It’s the harm combined with the lack of voice to be able to say something about that harm.”</p> <p>In the green hills of Covas, it is unclear whether a friendlier approach by Savannah and the authorities would have won people over or simply tempered their rage. But the anger at the process is palpable.</p> <p>“The biggest shock initially was not even the impact of the mine,” said Alves Scarrott, who grew up in Covas and moved to London. “It’s the attack on democracy, and democratic processes, and the rights of the people that live there.”</p>",

Most of the deaths – 85% – will be people over 65 years old, who are more vulnerable to the extreme heat. People in inner-city homes are also at high risk.</p> <p>More than 10,000 people died before their time in summer heatwaves between 2020 and 2024, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The government’s preparations to protect people from the escalating impacts of the climate crisis were condemned as “<a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/progress-in-adapting-to-climate-change-2025/\">inadequate, piecemeal and disjointed</a>” by official advisers in April.</p> <p>The 32C heat that will be endured by people in the south-east of England on Saturday will have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/20/england-weekend-heatwave-worse-climate-crisis\">made 100 times more likely</a> by the climate crisis, scientists said on Friday.</p> <p>“Heatwaves are silent killers – people who lose their lives in them typically have pre-existing health conditions and rarely have heat listed as a contributing cause of death,” said Dr Garyfallos Konstantinoudis, at Imperial College London, who is part of the team that estimated the number of deaths.</p> <p>“This real-time analysis reveals the hidden toll of heatwaves and we want it to help raise the alarm,” he said. “Heatwaves are an under-appreciated threat in the UK and they’re becoming more dangerous with climate change.”</p> <p>Prof Antonio Gasparrini, at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and also part of the analysis team, said: “Increases of just a degree or two can be the difference between life and death. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/13/weather-tracker-europe-china-record-breaking-heatwaves\">Weather tracker: Europe and China in midst of record-breaking heat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“When temperatures push past the limits populations are acclimatised to, excess deaths can increase very rapidly. Every fraction of a degree of warming will cause more hospital admissions and heat deaths, putting more strain on the NHS.”</p> <p>The analysis used decades of UK data to determine the relationship between temperatures and heat deaths in more than 34,000 areas across England and Wales. </p> <p>The researchers combined this with high-resolution weather forecasts to estimate that there will be about 570 deaths between Thursday and Sunday, with 129 in London. The number could be an underestimate, they said, as people were less prepared for heatwaves in early summer.</p> <p>Dr Malcolm Mistry, at LSHTM, said: “Exposure to temperatures in the high 20s or low 30s may not seem dangerous, but they can be fatal, particularly for people aged over 65, infants, pregnant people, and those with pre-existing health conditions.”</p> <p>The UKHSA sounded the alarm on Thursday with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/19/amber-weather-alert-for-heat-across-england-as-temperatures-rise\">amber heat-health alert</a>, also warning of “a rise in deaths” and “significant impacts” to health and social care services. The alert is expected to remain in force until 9am on Monday.</p> <p>Dr Lorna Powell, an NHS urgent care doctor in east London, said: “We are seeing cases of heat-related illnesses rising. </p> <p>“Heat exhaustion can quickly trigger more serious illnesses, as dehydration sets in and the cardiovascular system becomes overwhelmed. </p> <p>“We must stop burning coal, oil and gas if we are to stabilise our climate and prevent scores of preventable health issues, hospital visits and deaths.”</p> <p>The UKHSA recommends people keep out of the sun between 11am and 3pm on the hottest days, drink plenty of water, and look out for older people. A recent study estimated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/16/uk-homes-overheating-soars-study\">80% of UK homes overheat</a> in the summer. </p> <p>The hot sun has also led to a <a href=\"https://www.londonair.org.uk/Londonair/Forecast/\">warning of high ozone air pollution</a> in London on Saturday, with people with lung problems advised to limit exercise.</p> <p>The climate crisis drove the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time\">annual global temperature in 2024</a> to a new record and carbon dioxide emissions from coal, oil and gas are still rising. That means heatwaves will get ever more intense and frequent.</p> <p>A recent report by the UK climate change committee estimated that heat-related deaths could rise to more than 10,000 a year by 2050 if global temperatures rise to 2C above preindustrial levels.</p> <p>Globally, extreme heat is more deadly than floods, earthquakes and hurricanes combined, taking about 500,000 lives a year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.swissre.com/press-release/Extreme-heat-more-deadly-than-floods-earthquakes-and-hurricanes-combined-finds-Swiss-Re-039-s-SONAR-report/e4495ed0-8b77-49ce-ad70-30f6b72a9f26\">report by the insurer Swiss Re</a>. </p> <p>“Extreme heat events are more dangerous than natural catastrophes in terms of human lives lost, yet the true cost is only starting to come to light,” said Nina Arquint, a corporate solutions chief executive at Swiss Re.</p>",

Along the way Kane also scored one, made one and walked off with the Superior Player Of the Match laurels as Bayern Munich edged their way to a relentlessly entertaining 2-1 defeat of Boca Juniors in front of a high-energy full house.</p> <p>As a result, Bayern are now though to the knockout stage of the Club World Cup. A European team has also finally beaten a South American opponent at this tournament. But defeat still leaves Boca effectively in charge of their own destiny, with the fall-guys of Auckland City to come. They basically need to win by a spectacular margin and rely on Bayern to beat Porto.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/flamengo-chelsea-club-world-cup-match-report\">Flamengo stun Chelsea with comeback victory at Club World Cup as Jackson sees red</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There had been a lot of talk before this game about a night of full-contact combat in store for Bayern’s attack and midfield. The central defender Lauturo Di Lollo had been asked ahead of this tournament how he planned to cope with Kane, and replied “I’m going to kill him”. It was meant as a joke. Probably. But there was an excellent opportunity to test this from kick-off as Di Lollo started in central defence right up against his intended victim.</p> <p>The opening hour was something of a controlled suffocation as Bayern kept the ball and took the lead. But Boca dragged their way back into this game, blocking shots, hurling themselves into contact and equalising in the second half, before finding ultimately that Bayern just had too much quality in the clinches.</p> <p>This was a rare 9pm kick off, a much more sensible piece of scheduling in South Florida, by which time the heat has generally transitioned from Nordic sauna on the surface of the planet Venus levels to merely very hot and humid. It felt like a proper football match from two hours before kick-off as the vast shimmering surrounds of the Hard Rock Stadium were thronged with red, blue and yellow.</p> <p>This was a meeting of boisterous, alpha clubs, perhaps even distant cousins on Bavaria-La Plata continuum: domestic powerhouses, rousing music, regional meat culture. Although their only previous competitive meeting was the infamous 2001 Intercontinental Cup Final, which Bayern won 1-0. Among Boca fans that game is still remembered as the Robbery of the Century because of an allegedly dubious second yellow card awarded to Chelo Delgado.</p>    <p>It doesn’t look like a robbery now, with the benefit of YouTube hindsight. It looks like a stunningly beautiful through pass from Juan Roman Riquelme, followed by a very obvious dive. But there is at least a reassuring universality in the reactions of football supporters to such things.</p> <p>The Hard Rock was a Friday night sell-out from the start, packed to the far reaches of the upper tiers beneath the vast steel lattice roof. The ludicrous WWE-style player walk-out once again ate up four minutes of everyone’s life that they’ll never get back. This must be stopped. Nobody anywhere in the world needs to hear the words “KONRAD LAIMER!” in a throaty scream across the stadium PA, while an embarrassed looking Konrad Laimer walks out slowly across a piece of grass towards a lineup of bored-looking teammates.</p> <p>Bayern kicked off with Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman behind Kane, and the familiar Goretzka-Kimmich double pivot in midfield. Jonathan Tah, a new addition in central defence, also started here, aged 29 and a well-worn Bundesliga figure.</p> <p>Not much happened for a while as Bayern kept the ball comfortably. And Kane opened the scoring on 18 minutes, a nice finish after a sightly heavy first touch, easing the ball into the bottom corner, off the studs of his left boot. The ball had fallen to him from a deflection off Coman as he challenged for a cross. Kane was unspectacularly in the right place.</p>    <p>Thomas Tuchel was watching all this from the plush Fifa seats. Kane scoring in America, late June, South American defence, full house. This felt like good optics, a vibe, something packed away.</p> <p>Bayern had dominated every metric to that point, with 74% possession, 101 passes to 29, three shots and two corners to zero and zero. This has been the way Boca have played here, an attacking plan based on swift collective breaks. It involves a lot of waiting, a lot of singing in the stands while the opposition pass across the face of a low, muscular block.</p> <p>Boca had their first shot, a veering drive from a free-kick by Kevin Zenon that Manuel Neuer double-fisted away in the Continental Style. And Neuer made a very good save moments later, batting away with his left hand as Zenon shot again from a similar angle.</p> <p>It was a good game by now. Luis Advincula was booked for the latest in a series of conga-style hip-grabs on Coman as he spun away. Kane was taken out by Costa, left crumpled and clutching his ankle after a hip swivelling full body block.</p> <p>Boca began to emerge from their defensive crouch after half-time, although this coincided with a little extra space at the other end. Kane shot just over after good work from Gnabry. Olise, who played inside his own portable pocket of air all night, eased about radiating menace.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/club-world-cup-didnt-start-fire-expanding-overlapping\">Club World Cup didn’t start the fire – it didn’t light it but we’ll try to fight it | Max Rushden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was Boca who began to wrench at the throttle. And they equalised on 67 minutes with an excellent goal from Miguel Merentiel. It came from a break close to the halfway line. A fine through pass from Alan Velasco inside Jonathan Tah left Rentier with space in front of him. Tah had no chance, treading through heavy water as Merentiel sniped in on goal then lifted his finish past Neuer.</p> <p>The Hard Rock erupted, the bodies tumbling in the stands, drinks thrown, scarves twirled, a vast roar barrelling from one Boca end to the other Boca end. But it was Bayern who managed to rev up through the gears again, despite the worrying sight of Jamal Musiala, a second half sub, limping off injured once again.</p> <p>With seven minutes left Olise scored the winner, shooting low into the corner after a really smart little touch from Kane, finding just enough order out of a scramble and a press of bodies to nudge the ball back into Olise’s path. So Bayern can rest and tend to their bruises for the final group game against Porto. The amateurs of Auckland will be bracing themselves for next Tuesday night at Geodis Park, Tennessee.</p>",

At this inflection point in L.A. history, they only took questions from national reporters.”</p> <p>When a press aide to California’s governor, <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>, asked Michaelson on the social network who the reporters allowed in were, since “the tone felt more like partisan influencer content than real journalism”, the anchor for the local Fox affiliate replied: “I wasn’t allowed inside so I don’t know who was there. I didn’t recognize those voices. Those were not questions that most of my colleagues would have asked.”</p> <p>As we reported earlier, at least two of the partisan questions, inviting Vance to attack Democrats, were asked by <strong>Mary Margaret Olohan</strong>, a correspondent for the far-right Daily Wire, who was selected by the White House to be the official pool reporter traveling with Vance on Friday.</p> <p>According to Olohan’s dispatches, Vance had very little time to evaluate the situation on the ground in the city. His flight from Washington on Air Force Two touched down at LAX at 1:35 pm local time. Vance’s motorcade arrived at the federal building in Westwood being guarded by active-duty marines at 2pm. He started the news conference at 3:11pm.</p> <p>It is not clear exactly how much time Vance spent meeting marines, federal agents and officers from the Los Angeles Police Department and California highway patrol, but just after his fourteen minutes news conference ended, the Fox national correspondent <strong>Bill Melugin </strong>reported that he had managed to conduct an “exclusive” and “lengthy interview” with the vice-president during the 71 minutes Vance spent in the federal building before meeting the press he brought with him.</p> <p>According to Olohan, a short time later, Vance departed the federal building for a Republican National Committee event. By 6:05pm, he was back on Air Force Two at LAX and ready for departure after just four and a half hours in the city.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-06-21T02:05:10.214Z\">at 3.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6855f9e58f0840982823bc84\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laughland-oliver\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-21T00:18:44.408Z\">1.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Columbia University graduate <strong>Mahmoud Khalil</strong> was released from US immigration detention, where he had been held for more than three months over his activism against Israel’s war on Gaza.</p> <p>Khalil, the most high profile of the students to be arrested by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestinian activism, and the last of them still in detention, was ordered to be released by a federal judge on Friday afternoon from an Ice facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he has been held since shortly after plainclothes immigration agents detained him in early March in the lobby of his Columbia building.</p> <p>The federal judge, <strong>Michael Farbiarz</strong>, said during the hearing on Friday that Khalil is not a flight risk, and “is not a danger to the community.

Who in the intelligence community said that?” Trump replied.</p> <p>Informed that it was his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/congressional-testimonies/congressional-testimonies-2025/4059-ata-opening-statement-as-prepared\">testified to congress</a> in March that the 18 US intelligence agencies she oversees “continue[s] to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”</p> <p>When it comes to his claims about having loudly opposed the war in Iraq, the facts show that Trump, for a decade, has been misstating his actual stance on Iraq at the time of the US invasion, when he first voiced tepid support for the war before it was launched, and then, after it went wrong, became a critic.</p> <p>“I was very much opposed to Iraq”, Trump claimed on Friday. “I said it loud and clear, but I was a civilian, but I guess I got a lot of publicity, but I was very much opposed to the Iraq war, and I actually did say, ‘Don’t go in, don’t go in, don’t go in’, but I said, ‘If you’re going to go in, keep the oil’”.</p> <p>In a radio interview on September 11, 2002, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump-said-he-supported-invading-iraq-on-the\">unearthed by Buzzfeed News in 2016</a>, the comedian Howard Stern asked Trump if he was in favor of the US invading Iraq.</p> <p>“Yeah, I guess so”, Trump responded.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claim-opposed-iraq-invasion\">CNN reported in 2019</a>, Trump came out against the Iraq war more than a year after it started, telling Howard Stern in April 2004: “Iraq is a terrible mistake.”</p> <p>Three months later, Trump <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/videos/a47684/trump-iraq-war/\">told Esquire magazine in July 2004</a>: “it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!”</p> <p>The final part of Trump’s claim about what he said on Iraq comes from a statement he first made not in 2003, but eight years later, in April 2011, when he was toying with a run to unseat Barack Obama and unveiled in an interview with the Fox host Bill O’Reilly his idea that the US should have kept Iraq’s oil.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqnqyX2Z85Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mqnqyX2Z85Y?start=1341&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=1341\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Donald Trump spoke about Iraq to Bill O’Reilly on Fox in 2011.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>“I’ve never said this before.

I’m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you the news over the next few hours.</p> <p>We start with the news that <strong>a US appeals court let Donald Trump retain control on Thursday of California’s national guard</strong> while the state’s Democratic governor proceeds with a lawsuit challenging the Republican president’s use of the troops to quell protests in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Trump’s decision to send troops into Los Angeles prompted a national debate about the use of the military on US soil and inflamed political tension in the country’s second most-populous city.</p> <p>On Thursday, a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit court of appeals extended its pause on U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer’s 12 June ruling that Trump had unlawfully called the national guard into federal service.</p> <p>Trump probably acted within his authority, the panel said, adding that his administration probably complied with the requirement to coordinate with Governor Gavin Newsom, and even if it did not, he had no authority to veto Trump’s directive.</p> <p>“And although we hold that the president likely has authority to federalize the national guard, nothing in our decision addresses the nature of the activities in which the federalized national guard may engage,” it wrote in its opinion.</p> <p>Newsom could still challenge the use of the national guard and U.S. Marines under other laws, including the bar on using troops in domestic law enforcement, it added. The governor could raise those issues at a court hearing on Friday in front of Breyer, it said.</p> <p>In a post on X after the decision, Newsom vowed to pursue his challenge.</p> <p>“The president is not a king and is not above the law,” he said. “We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump’s authoritarian use of US military soldiers against our citizens.”</p> <p>Trump hailed the decision in a post on Truth Social. “This is a great decision for our country and we will continue to protect and defend law-abiding Americans,” he said.</p> <p>“This is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should state and local police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.”</p> <p>In other news:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/los-angeles-dodgers\">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> said they blocked US immigration enforcement agents from accessing the parking lot at Dodger Stadium on Thursday</strong> and got into public back-and-forth statements with Ice and the Department of Homeland Security, which denied their agents were ever there.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Department of Homeland Security is now requiring lawmakers to provide 72 hours of notice before visiting detention centers, according to new guidance.</strong> The guidance comes after a slew of tense visits from Democratic lawmakers to detention centers amid Trump’s crackdowns in immigrant communities across the country.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump’s administration from forcing 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to receive billions of dollars in transportation grant funding.</strong> Chief US district judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, granted the states’ request for an injunction barring the Department for Transportation’s policy, saying the states were likely to succeed on the merits of some or all of their claims.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The office of the US defense secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth\">Pete Hegseth</a>, requested “a passive approach to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/19/juneteenth-other-emancipation-celebrations\">Juneteenth</a> messaging”, according to an exclusive Rolling Stone <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/hegseth-juneteenth-holiday-passive-approach-1235368064/\">report </a>citing a Pentagon email.</strong> The messaging request for Juneteenth – a federal holiday commemorating when enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, learned they were free – was transmitted by the Pentagon’s office of the chief of public affairs. This office said it was not poised to publish web content related to Juneteenth, Rolling Stone reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Depending on who you ask, between 4 and 6 million people showed up to last weekend’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/15/us-protesters-trump-voices\">“No Kings” protests</a>.</strong> Now the real number is becoming clearer, with one estimate suggesting that Saturday was among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade\">the biggest</a>.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

The baby was born while Khalil was held in detention. He looked forward to their first hug in private. He looked forward to seeing his wife, who had been present at the time of his arrest.</p> \n<p>He smiled briefly.</p> \n<p>And then he turned back towards a car, ready to take him on the first leg of a journey back home.</p>",

That doesn’t mean there is a right person for this. There is no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.”</p> \n<p>Khalil told reporters he was looking forward to returning home to spend time with his infant son, who was born while his father was detained. “I can actually hug him,” Khalil said.</p> \n<p>The federal judge, Michael Farbiarz, said during the hearing on Friday that Khalil is not a flight risk, and “is not a danger to the community. Period, full stop.”</p> \n<p>“It is highly, highly unusual to be seeking detention of a petitioner given the factual record of today,” Farbiarz also said during the hearing.</p> \n<p>Farbiarz said that the government had “clearly not met” the standards for detention.</p> \n<p>Later on Friday, Khalil was ordered to surrender his passport and green card to Ice officials in Jena as part of his conditional release. The order also stipulated that Khalil’s travel be limited to a handful of US states, including New York, as Louisiana, Michigan and New Jersey for court appearances.</p> \n<p>The judge’s order gave Khalil a 6.30pm CT deadline to surrender his travel documents before release.</p> \n<p>Khalil’s arrest was widely decried as a dangerous escalation in the Trump administration’s campaign against speech protected by the first amendment to the US constitution. Khalil has not been charged with a crime.</p> \n<p>His detention was the first in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/28/trump-immigration-people-detained-deported-cases\">series of arrests</a> of international student activists, and his release marks the latest in a series of defeats for the administration, which had promised to deport pro-Palestinian international students en masse.</p> \n<p>Three other students detained on similar grounds – Rümeysa Öztürk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/14/judge-order-release-khan-suri-ice\">Badar Khan Suri</a> and <a href=\"https://c/\">Mohsen Mahdawi</a> – were previously released while their immigration cases are pending.

Jewish students and faculty had submitted court documents on Khalil’s behalf, and he was quoted last year on CNN saying that “the liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/28/trump-immigration-people-detained-deported-cases\">Denied, detained, deported: the faces of Trump’s immigration crackdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Farbiaz ordered Khalil’s release in his federal court case, which was brought to challenge his detention. His immigration case will proceed on a separate track. While the government has suffered setbacks to its foreign policy argument in multiple courts, it is likely to continue arguing that its efforts to deport Khalil are also supported by alleged omissions in his green card application – arguments it brought several weeks after he was first detained, and which his attorneys have refuted.</p> \n<p>Khalil is married to a US citizen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/08/mahmoud-khalil-wife-letter\">Noor Abdallah</a>, who gave birth to their first child during her husband’s detention. “I fight for you, and for every Palestinian child whose life deserves safety, tenderness and freedom,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/10/mahmoud-kahlil-letter-to-newborn-son\">Khalil wrote to his newborn son, Deen</a>, last month in a letter first published in the Guardian. “I hope one day you will stand tall knowing your father was not absent out of apathy, but out of conviction.”</p> \n<p>In a statement provided by Khalil’s lawyers, Abdalla said she can finally “breathe a sigh of relief” after the ruling.</p> \n<p>“We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family, and so many others, but today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back to New York to be reunited with our little family.”</p> \n<p>In response to the news that the judge had ordered Khalil to be released on Friday, Amnesty International USA <a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/amnesty-international-welcomes-ruling-for-mahmoud-khalils-long-overdue-release/\">celebrated the decision, calling it</a> “overdue” and called on the Trump administration to “immediately comply with this order”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>JD Vance, the US vice-president, accused California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests as he used an in Los Angeles to rebut criticism from state and local officials that the Trump administration fueled the unrest by sending in federal officers.</p> <p>The centerpiece of Vance’s Friday visit was a 14-minute news conference, during which he delivered remarks and took questions from correspondents selected by the White House. Local reporters were barred from attending, according to Elex Michaelson, the host of Fox LA’s local evening news report.</p> <p>“It’s disappointing” <a href=\"https://x.com/Elex_Michaelson/status/1936206237106163755\">Michaelson wrote on X</a>, that the vice-president “did not allow local reporters inside his Los Angeles press event. At this inflection point in L.A. history, they only took questions from national reporters.”</p> <p>When a correspondent for the far-right Daily Wire, who was selected by the White House to be the official pool reporter traveling with Vance, asked about a series of Democrats who have been placed in handcuffs recently by federal officers, Vance attempted to joke about California senator Alex Padilla who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jun/12/la-protests-los-angeles-california-curfew-ice-immigration-marines-national-guard-donald-trump-latest-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-684b57ac8f08fa293877a0a2#block-684b57ac8f08fa293877a0a2\">forcibly detained</a> by the FBI in the same location last week. Vance, however, called him “Jose Padilla”, using the name of an American citizen who was accused of planning to detonate a radioactive dirty bomb on behalf of al-Qaida in 2002.</p> <p>“I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,” Vance said. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn’t a theater. And that’s all it is.”</p> <p>Katie Porter, a former Democratic member of congress who is running for governor of California, called Vance’s remark: “Despicable-something you’d expect from an internet troll.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Padilla, Tess Oswald, noted in a social media post that Padilla and Vance were formerly colleagues in the Senate and said that Vance should know better.</p> <p>“He should be more focused on demilitarizing our city than taking cheap shots,” Oswald said.</p> <p>Responding to the outrage, Taylor Van Kirk, a spokesperson for Vance, said of the vice-president: “He must have mixed up two people who have broken the law.”</p> <p>Vance’s visit to Los Angeles to tour a multi-agency federal joint operations center and a mobile command center came as demonstrations calmed down in the city and a curfew was lifted this week. That followed over a week of clashes between protesters and police and outbreaks of vandalism and looting that followed immigration raids across southern California.</p> <p>Trump’s dispatching of his top emissary to Los Angeles at a time of turmoil surrounding the Israel-Iran war and the US’s future role in it signals the political importance Trump places on his hard-line immigration policies. Vance echoed the president’s harsh rhetoric toward California Democrats as he sought to blame them for the protests in the city.</p> <p>“Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass, by treating the city as a sanctuary city, have basically said that this is open season on federal law enforcement,” Vance said after he toured federal immigration enforcement offices.</p> <p>“What happened here was a tragedy,” he added. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job. That is disgraceful. And it is why the president has responded so forcefully.”</p> <p>Newsom’s spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement: “The vice-president’s claim is categorically false. The governor has consistently condemned violence and has made his stance clear.”</p> <p>The friction in Los Angeles began on 6 June, when federal agents conducted a series of immigration sweeps in the region that have continued since. Amid the protests and over the objections of state and local officials, Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 national guard troops and 700 marines to the second-largest US city, home to 3.8 million people.</p> <p>Trump has said that without the military’s involvement, Los Angeles “would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years”.</p> <p>A review of Vance’s movements on Friday suggests that he had very little time to evaluate the situation in the city. His flight from Washington touched down at Los Angeles International airport at 1:35 pm local time. Vance’s motorcade arrived at the federal building in Westwood that is being guarded by active-duty marines at 2pm. He started his news conference at 3:11pm.</p> <p>It is not clear exactly how much of the intervening 71 minutes Vance spent meeting marines, federal agents and local police officers, but he devoted at least part of that time doing an interview with the Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin.</p> <p>At 3:30 pm, Vance departed the federal building for a Republican National Committee event. By 6:05pm, he was back on Air Force Two at LAX and ready for departure just four and a half hours after he had arrived.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Gardening is good for our physical and psychological health, and there’s great pleasure in plucking ripe tomatoes, salad leaves or fresh herbs to add to a meal. Growing your own food has environmental benefits too, especially if you use a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/10/dont-bin-it-compost-it-a-beginners-guide-to-smarter-food-waste\">compost heap, worm farm or bokashi bin</a> to divert kitchen scraps from landfill.</p> <p>But can you garden without a back yard? To meet Australia’s housing challenge, more city dwellers will live in apartments and townhouses, and gardening in small spaces like balconies and courtyards can be challenging.</p> <p>I found this out last summer when I planted tomatoes in pots on our west-facing balcony. By Christmas, the plants were vigorous and tall, providing a calming wall of green outside my 20th-floor window. But sweltering January days put paid to my hopes of a bountiful crop. Despite plenty of water, the plants couldn’t cope with drying winds and the belting afternoon sun, its rays magnified through glass balustrades.</p> <h2>What to consider when gardening at height</h2> <p>Horticulturist Charlotte Harrison from <a href=\"https://www.sgaonline.org.au/companion-planting/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20614990251&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwotDBBhCQARIsAG5pinP7cV7OWu8xxz-XPIFRe9Gy-8bFlhFDgASweo2kHZ1RyDxtMb8nTpAaAiklEALw_wcB\">Sustainable Gardening Australia</a> thinks I might have had better luck if I’d planted tomatoes later in the season.</p> <p>“Gardening at height is more extreme than gardening at ground level,” she says. “There’s heaps of extra heat radiating from the concrete of the building plus extra light reflected from glass.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/04/downsizing-the-australian-dream-why-families-are-trading-houses-with-backyards-for-apartments\">Downsizing the Australian dream: why families are trading houses with back yards for apartments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a rule of thumb, Harrison reckons high-rise balconies can be one climate zone warmer than is normal for the local area. On our Melbourne balcony, she says, I’d do better to consult a Sydney planting chart when deciding what to grow and when.</p> <p>“Think about the microclimate of the space you’re gardening in,” advises Harrison. “Consider how these conditions might be replicated in nature and what might grow there naturally.”</p> <p>An east-facing space is generally more conducive to growing vegetables in summer than a west-facing one. Plants enjoy early light, when the sun is gentler, and shade in the afternoon as the temperature rises.</p> <p>Winds are stronger higher up a building, so our balcony could be compared to a seaside cliff in the Mediterranean, better suited to hardy plants like olives and rosemary than to tomatoes. If conditions are too harsh for fruit or vegetables, then succulents and other desert plants can help to green a space instead.</p> <h2>No shade? Solutions for following (or avoiding) the sun</h2> <p>Creating shade on a balcony can be tricky. Body corporate rules may restrict what can be fixed to the building, but anything not securely anchored could blow away and injure someone below. One option is planter boxes with attached shade hoods. Harrison recommends choosing one that is light in colour to reflect heat and that has a <a href=\"https://www.sgaonline.org.au/wicking-beds/\">wicking bed</a> so plants can draw on a reservoir of water. Make sure you’re not overloading your balcony or deck – a planter box full of soil can double in weight when watered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/21/is-my-rented-garden-an-act-of-resistance-to-the-precarity-of-my-living-situation-possibly\">Is my rented garden an act of resistance to the precarity of my living situation? Possibly | Jaimee Frances Edwards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When growing in pots, bigger is generally better, says Harrison, because soil in small pots dries out quickly, even when well mulched. Most plants need as much space for roots below as their branches and leaves take up above, so it’s better to grow four plants together in one large pot to share soil and resources than separately in four little ones. Before planting, put large pots on low stands with heavy duty castors so they can be easily moved to follow (or avoid) the sun as it shifts with the seasons. And don’t forget drip trays to conserve water and avoid annoying downstairs neighbours.</p> <h2>Selecting the right plants: try trellises and compact varieties</h2> <p>Think carefully about plant selection based on your conditions. Compact varieties of tomatoes, chillies or lemons will be less prone to wind and sun damage than taller traditional varieties. Root vegetables are good for windy settings because soil protects them from the elements.</p> <p>Too much sun is one challenge for gardening in small spaces, too little is another. There’s no point in trying flowering vegetables in spots lacking direct sunlight. For a shady position, leafy greens are a better option, or perhaps you can grow upwards to reach the light. A zucchini plant, for example, is a vine and can be trained to grow up a trellis or a stake.</p> <p>“Growing vertically can really increase growing space,” says Harrison. But the horticulturist is wary of vertical gardens. They look good, but often need dedicated watering systems and involve plants in small pots that need constant replacement. “For most home gardeners, having a trellis makes far more sense,” she says.</p> <p>Gardening is a source of great pleasure and makes the concrete jungle a bit greener. A <a href=\"https://communitygarden.org.au/\">community garden</a> can be a great way to get your fingers in the dirt and meet your neighbours. But don’t let limited space deter you from gardening at home too. Harrison’s advice: “Dream big, but start small.”</p>",

It wasn’t sustainable so we decided to move to Katoomba, on the traditional lands of the Dharug and Gundungurra people.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/millions-of-visitors-drive-through-this-town-every-year-some-tell-them-to-skip-it-20250505-p5lwoz.html\">I read an article recently</a> saying something like “skip it, it’s not at its best” but Katoomba has a beautiful authenticity, even if it’s not quite polished.</p> <p>Our closest upper mountain towns are Leura and Blackheath. Katoomba is all old-world treasures and beautiful building facades. Blackheath has the incredible <a href=\"https://victorytheatre.com.au/\">Victory Theatre Antique Centre</a>, Gleebooks, <a href=\"https://www.hathillgallery.com.au/\">Hat Hill Records &amp; Audio</a> and great rock climbing and hikes. Leura has an upscale main drag full of lifestyle and fashion stores, but it gets busy on weekends. I recommend walking the backstreets to see the cute cottages and gardens.</p> <h2>Food</h2>    <p>Our favourite place to eat is the award-winning <a href=\"https://www.atesblackheath.com/\">Ates</a> in Blackheath. It serves delicious Mediterranean-style share plates and always feels like a special night out. Much of its food is cooked in its 150-year-old wood-fired oven and there’s a greenery-filled courtyard.</p> <p>On weekends, <a href=\"https://www.tempuskatoomba.com.au/\">Tempus</a> Katoomba has a fine-dining menu with an incredible all-Australian drinks list. It’s in the old bank and lots of historical parts remain but the interiors are fun and fresh. On weekday mornings it switches to the Tempest Up Early cafe, serving Little Marionette coffee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/25/a-locals-guide-to-broken-hill-chances-are-someone-will-spark-up-a-chat\">A local’s guide to Broken Hill: ‘Chances are, someone will spark up a chat’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We’re so lucky to have <a href=\"https://www.blackcockatoobakery.com.au/\">Black Cockatoo</a> bakery here.

You can detour down to the <a href=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/pool-of-siloam-walk\">Pool of Siloam</a> waterhole for a swim. It has a sandy beach and doesn’t get too crowded.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/lockley-pylon-walking-track\">Lockley Pylon</a> is a three-hour walk (7.2km return) mostly along a ridge in north Leura. It’s known for stunning wildflowers in spring, like boronia and waratah. It’s very exposed, so walking on windy or super-hot days is not advised. At the end there’s an incredible view over the Grose Valley.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.bmcc.nsw.gov.au/wentworth-falls-lake-park\">Wentworth Falls Lake Park</a> has a new walkway and a viewing platform along the eastern edge that’s pram and wheelchair-friendly. The area still feels wild in places but there’s also a big playground, a cute jetty and ducks. People kayak and canoe here; we like to swim on the north side in the shade of the gumtrees. It’s busy on weekends with people barbecuing and picnicking.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.walkmyworld.com/posts/minnehaha-falls-blue-mountains\">Minnehaha Falls</a> in North Katoomba is 2.7km return with some stairs, but the waterhole at the end is a sublime swimming spot. The track follows Yosemite Creek which has loads of scribbly gums and banksia.</p> <p>I love native plants but I’m also a sucker for the lilacs, tulips and maples at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.au/places/everglades-house-gardens/\">Everglades House and Gardens</a>. The art deco house is a wonderful glimpse into the past and you can do Devonshire tea in the tearoom. The 12-acre garden is manicured in some parts and bushy in others and you can picnic on the lawn.</p> <h2>Nightlife</h2>    <p>Down in the Lawson industrial area (15 minutes’ drive east of Katoomba) is a quarterly experimental arts event run by <a href=\"https://www.sirc-uit.com/\">SIRC_UIT</a>. It’s always a unique experience, with performance and installation, and there’s a pop-up bar and food.</p> <p><a href=\"https://zoesblackheath.com/\">Zoe’s Blackheath</a> has live music, Italian-influenced pub-style food and a great bar for a casual drink.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mountainculture.com.au/\">Mountain Culture Brewpub</a> in Katoomba is in a rambling 1900s building.

There’s great views and yummy burgers and fried pickles.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://aquaignisbathhouse.com/\">Aqua Ignis</a> is a new sauna and bathhouse in Blackheath that’s open until 9pm. It has magnesium baths and a herbal steam room; it’s such a restorative evening. <a href=\"https://www.bmsauna.com.au/\">Blue Mountains Sauna</a> in Leura has been around longer; it’s a more traditional Nordic-style space with regular “clothing optional” sessions.</p> <h2>Inspiration</h2>    <p><a href=\"https://bluemountainsculturalcentre.com.au/\">Blue Mountains Cultural Centre</a> in Katoomba is a crucial stop for art lovers. It features touring shows, such as the Archibald prize and the Wynne prize, as well as exhibitions from renowned local artists such as Claire Healy, Sean Cordeiro and Nick Stathopoulos. There’s also an immersive permanent video installation filmed in the national park.</p> <p>I’m a mural artist, and the encouragement of street art here is so nice. Me and four other female mural artists painted the Froma Lane walkway that connects Katoomba Street to the centre.</p> <p>Beverley Place was really dilapidated 10 years ago before it was transformed into the <a href=\"https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains/katoomba-area/katoomba/attractions/street-art-walk\">Katoomba Street Art Walk</a>. When a wall mural fades a new artist is invited to paint it. It’s a really cool space to walk through. The cultural centre runs short street art tours or you can use a self-guided map.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.landslidegallery.com.au/\">Landslide Gallery</a> in Wentworth Falls was once an old flour mill. It runs an Australia-wide and international artist-in-residency program and its exhibitions showcase the incredibly diverse mediums of Blue Mountains artists, from ceramics to sculpture, paintings and textile art.</p> <p><a href=\"https://daygallery.com.au/\">Day Gallery</a> is a commercial gallery in Blackheath; the couple behind it, Helen and Vincent Day, are legends. Their roster of artists is truly inspiring. During Covid lockdowns, renowned local painter and musician Claire Nakazawa (from the band Haiku Hands) created a mural on the external wall as her response to the landscapes after the black summer fires.</p> <h2>Neighbourhood</h2>    <p>The area around the Blue Mountains Cultural Centre in Katoomba is getting so vibrant. Katoomba Civic Centre’s gardens are re-landscaped with tree ferns and banksias, and it’s a lovely stroll through the Carrington hotel’s garden down to Katoomba Street.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://bmfoodcoop.org.au/\">Blue Mountains Co-op</a> is near there and has a kiosk with the most amazing soups. The co-op market garden is next to the <a href=\"https://bluemountainsculturalcentre.com.au/\">cultural centre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thecarrington.com.au/\">the Carrington hotel</a>. It’s run by <a href=\"https://www.farmitforward.com.au/\">Farm it Forward</a>, which makes unused pieces of land productive. This patch was long abandoned and now it has a head farmer and the co-op sells its seasonal organic produce. I painted a produce-inspired mural on an adjoining heritage-listed wall to bring some joy and to revive the space.</p> <h2>Accommodation</h2>    <p><a href=\"https://thecarrington.com.au/\">The Carrington</a> (from $230 a night) is an old-world beauty and I love looking at the historical photographs of how Katoomba began, with just the Carrington at the top of the hill and this rickety train line.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.thekyah.com.au/\">Kyah</a> (from $190 per night) is a very cool renovated motel in Blackheath. It has a great restaurant called Blaq, gardens, a tennis court and a hot tub.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/24/locals-guide-to-beechworth-victoria-food-wine-music-waterfalls\">Music, wine and waterfalls: a local’s guide to Beechworth</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://chaletsblackheath.com.au/\">Chalets at Blackheath</a> (from $1,300 a night; sleeps two) are very high-end and dreamy. There are four freestanding chalets with bushland views. They have fireplaces, bathtubs and a sundeck; you’re really immersed in the environment and birdsong.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/43657476?source_impression_id=p3_1749454492_P3foS1wwE5cydtk2\">Cloud Parade</a> (from $1,095 a night; sleeps 10) is an Airbnb in Leura with lovely interiors and stunning valley views.

            "body" : "<p>Colin Mandy SC, Erin Patterson’s barrister in her triple-murder trial, was into the final minute of a closing submission that spanned three days when he started repeating one phrase, almost like a mantra, over and over.</p> \n<p>It was the last time the jury would hear from anyone in the case other than Justice Christopher Beale, a coda after the prosecution’s closing argument and evidence from more than 50 witnesses.</p> \n<p>Twelve times Mandy said it in the last 60 seconds or so, the only answer, the one thing he wanted the jury to know: “not guilty”.</p> \n<p>Patterson, 50, is facing three charges of murder and one of attempted murder in the Victorian supreme court. The charges relate to allegedly using death cap mushrooms in beef wellingtons served to lunch guests at her house in Leongatha on 29 July 2023.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/20/calculated-deceptions-and-ridiculous-propositions-what-the-erin-patterson-jury-heard-in-the-final-week-of-her-triple-murder-trial-ntwnfb\">‘Calculated deceptions’ and ‘ridiculous’ propositions: what the Erin Patterson jury heard in the eighth week of her triple-murder trial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering the relatives of her estranged husband, Simon Patterson – his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and aunt, Heather Wilkinson – and attempting to murder his uncle, Ian Wilkinson, Heather’s husband.</p> \n<p>“If you think that it’s possible that Erin deliberately poisoned the meal, you must find her not guilty,” Mandy said.</p> \n<p>“If you think that maybe Erin deliberately poisoned the meal, you must find her not guilty.</p> \n<p>“If you think that she probably deliberately poisoned the meal, you must find her not guilty.”</p> \n<p>“Possible”, “maybe” and “probably” were emphasised, a nod to what Mandy says is a prosecution case that has not cleared the high bar of reasonable doubt.</p> \n<p>The jury should not consider the trial like a boxing match, prosecution and defence slugging it out, but the high jump, Mandy told the court. Only the prosecution, however, had to clear that bar; Patterson didn’t even need to jump.</p> \n<p>“If you think at the end of your deliberations, taking into account the arguments that we’ve made that it is a [reasonable] possibility that this was an accident … you must find her not guilty,” Mandy said.</p> \n<p>“And if you think it is a reasonable possibility that her evidence was true, you must find her not guilty.</p> \n<p>“Our submission to you is the prosecution can’t get over that high bar of beyond reasonable doubt. And when you consider the actual evidence … and consider it properly, methodically, analytically, your verdicts on these charges should be not guilty.”</p> \n<p>Of the evidence given by Patterson, Mandy told the jury she came through unscathed, her account of what really happened the day of the lunch intact.</p> \n<p>“Her account remained coherent and consistent, day after day after day, even when challenged, rapid fire, from multiple angles, repeatedly.”</p> \n<p>Even if the jury were not convinced of that account, it did not mean Patterson was guilty, he said.</p> \n<p>“If you reject her evidence, then what you have to do is take that evidence, put it to one side, and still consider whether the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence that they bring,” Mandy said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b00b7125-242f-4e3c-a2f6-247af248f565\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YarSIPD0L8U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the prosecution’s telling, it wasn’t just that Patterson’s evidence was not convincing: it was a “calculated deception” played on the jury.</p> \n<p>The contrast in message between the defence and prosecution was also delivered with a contrast in style.</p> \n<p>Nanette Rogers SC delivered the prosecution’s closing address carefully and evenly, with the occasional pause for effect, her adherence to the pages in front of her so regimented that she would repeat sentences if she started them differently to how they had been written.</p> \n<p>Mandy was far more animated, almost theatrical, with flourishes that bordered on the comical.</p> \n<p>He mocked the prosecution case that Patterson planned the murders as far back as 28 April 2023, when it is alleged she picked death cap mushrooms after finding a post on iNaturalist, a citizen science website where the location of the mushrooms was shared.</p> \n<p>“On the Crown case, you might think remarkably, extraordinarily, Erin Patterson observed and acted on the only two sightings of death cap mushrooms ever in South Gippsland … like she was sitting there waiting for them,” Mandy said.</p> \n<p>“Never seen them before in South Gippsland. iNaturalist says they don’t grow here. Refresh. Nup, still not there. Refresh. Still not there. Refresh, still not there.”</p> \n<p>Mandy then exclaimed “ah”, his hands wide, pretending to be Patterson discovering the post about death cap mushrooms.</p> \n<p>“How likely is that?” he asked.</p> \n<p>Mandy lent all the way forward on to the lectern at this stage and immediately shifted tone. “There’s not one scrap of evidence that she actually saw those posts,” he said, shaking his right pointer finger towards the jury.</p> \n<h2>Patterson ‘not on trial for lying’</h2> \n<p>The closing addresses are not evidence, but new matters emerged, or were drawn into sharper focus.</p> \n<p>Mandy said it was possible Patterson became unwell earlier than her lunch guests because she tasted the duxelles as she prepared the beef wellingtons.</p> \n<p>Patterson said the duxelles tasted bland when she cooked down button mushrooms bought from the supermarket, so she added dried mushrooms from a Tupperware container in her pantry. At the time, she thought these were from an Asian grocer, but now believed the container also held death cap mushrooms she accidentally foraged.</p> \n<p>Mandy made clear, however, that Patterson gave no such evidence that she re-tasted the duxelles after adding the dried mushrooms.</p> \n<p>He also wanted to make clear Patterson was “not on trial for lying”.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Mandy told the jury, if she had been lying about some of the points the prosecution alleged she had, she would have told better lies: why say she didn’t know what was in her vomit, if saying it contained beef wellington would help her? Why not say she had vomited after overeating sooner, given that the greater proximity of vomiting to eating the beef wellington, the greater the likelihood it would reduce the extent of illness?</p> \n<p>This came after Rogers had catalogued these lies – lies she said Patterson told to other witnesses in the case, and to the jury. Lies told not in the heat of the moment, lies Patterson has admitted, lies she has not.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the starkest of these, Rogers said, was Patterson’s lie about weight loss surgery.</p> \n<p>“In the lead up to the lunch and in the periods after the lunch, Erin Patterson told so many lies it’s hard to keep track of them. She has told lies upon lies because she knew the truth would implicate her,” the prosecutor said.</p> \n<p>“When she knew her lies had been uncovered, she came up with a carefully constructed narrative to fit with the evidence – almost. There are some inconsistencies that she just cannot account for so she ignores them, says she can’t remember those conversations, or says other people are just wrong, even her own children.</p> \n<p>“You will therefore have no difficulty in rejecting … that this was all a horrible foraging accident.”</p> \n<p>Rogers said there was no other “reasonable alternative explanation for what happened to the lunch guests, other than the accused deliberately sourced death cap mushrooms and deliberately included them in the meal she served them, with an intention to kill them”.</p> \n<p>Justice Christopher Beale has told the jury that his closing charge to them, when he will discuss the legal principles that apply to them considering their verdict and direct them on how the evidence can be used, will take at least two days.</p> \n<p>“First of all, maintain an open mind. You have heard the evidence. You have heard the closing speeches of the prosecution and the defence, but you have not heard my charge,” Beale said.</p> \n<p>“The second point, and the last point, is it is more important than ever that you have a good weekend. I really want you to come back refreshed.”</p> \n<p>The trial at the Latrobe Valley law courts in Morwell was originally expected to last five to six weeks, but is set to stretch into a ninth.</p> \n<p>Court will resume on Tuesday, meaning the jury will not retire to consider its verdict until Wednesday at the earliest.</p>",

Pink Pony Club by Chappell Roan – one of Hayden’s favourite artists – is playing on repeat, and the revolving floor beneath her is surrounded by objects: an old wooden rocking horse, a tattered teddy and a pair of embroidered suede Miu Miu boots.</p> <p>Hayden is filming a video for a new exhibition at the Powerhouse museum, one she has co-curated about textural objects. Every object in the exhibition has been selected by the 27-year-old from the Powerhouse’s vast collection.</p> <p>“All of the objects here represent me in some form – the cows are my favourite,” she says, referring to ornate miniature cattle dating back to the 1870s, made from papier-mache, beeswax and cow hair. “It’s very common for autistic people to build connections with inanimate objects, and these cows are very similar to the toy animals I have at home.”</p>    <p>The fragile figurines will be on display in a new exhibition series titled Powerhouse Materials. Hayden is the inaugural guest curator for the series, which showcases a fraction of the items from the 500,000-plus objects in the museum’s collection. Hayden was given the theme “textiles”; later in the year, children’s author Andy Griffiths will curate an iteration with the theme “paper”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Hayden spent a month working with the museum to whittle down a long list of objects to 17 items, including a child’s Annie Oakley costume from the 1950s and a silk chiffon Barrier Reef dress and accompanying seaweed cape by the fashion designer Linda Jackson. It’s Hayden’s first time working with an institution on a project of this scale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/26/ayesha-madon-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet\">Ayesha Madon: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Chloé is an activist and advocate for many things, including her personal style and sensibility,” says Clare Holland, director of program at the Powerhouse. “Her unique way of engaging with the world has shaped the materials she has chosen.”</p> <p>Hayden, who is nominated for a silver Logie this year for best supporting actress as Heartbreak High’s Quinni, frequently shares TikTok videos of her colourful and textural outfits, as well as her experiences with autism, ADHD and chronic illness.</p> <p>Quinni has been a “huge part of my identity”, says Hayden, “but it’s one facet”. “I feel like I wear many faces. The one I know – that my family, husband and friends know – isn’t the face the public knows. This is Chloé,” she says, gesturing to her clothing and the items around her.</p>    <p>Since finishing filming the third and final season of Heartbreak High (out later this year), Chloé is reconnecting with her first love, horses, on her farm in regional Victoria. Hayden says horse riding was her “whole identity” before the Netflix series. “Now no one even knows that about me.”</p> <p>One of the Powerhouse collection items she has chosen to represent her country lifestyle is a men’s Driza-Bone jacket, gifted to the museum in 1994. “My first Driza-Bone was one my mum wore when she was a little girl … I wear one every winter when I ride my horse.”</p>      <p>She competes in an equestrian sport called Extreme Cowboys. “The best way I can describe it is like an agility course for dogs – but you’re on a 500-kilo animal. You have to do the obstacles as fast as you can, as accurately as you can,” she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/21/chloe-hayden-on-pigeons-high-school-and-celebrity-run-ins-this-hand-pulls-me-up-and-its-hugh-jackman\">Chloé Hayden on pigeons, high school and celebrity run-ins: ‘This hand pulls me up … and it’s Hugh Jackman’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her mother, Sarah Hayden, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.murdochbooks.com/browse/book/Sarah-Hayden-Parenting-Different-9781761500237\">Parenting Different</a> about raising neurodiverse children, runs an equine therapy clinic. In the book, her daughter writes that “riding with a group of ‘cowboys’, who … only judged me on how I rode and loved my horse, gave me a time in my week to stop masking and just be Chloé”.</p> <p>Embracing her special interests – animals, horse riding, fashion – come through in the items she has selected, such as a skin-tight green Jordan Gogos outfit made of fabric scraps.</p> <p>“I think fashion should be fun,” she says. “We play dress-ups as kids and we forget how to play dress-ups when we grow up.” Today she’s wearing an embellished halterneck and miniskirt by Camilla, created in collaboration with Wicked the Musical.</p> <p>Another connecting thread is toys and childhood nostalgia. For the exhibition, Hayden chose a Japanese teddy from 1927, a Mickey Mouse soft toy and a silk-printed teddy bear backpack designed by Akira Isogawa. She says she gets emotionally attached to toy animals.</p>    <p>At home, Hayden has accumulated 140 model horses by Breyer and Schleich – a collection only outdone by her teddy bears. “I have 150 of them,” she says. “When I was 18 I went to an op-shop and found this mangled teddy bear deer. He was missing an eye and his ear was off, but I had to have him.</p> <p>“I left the op-shop bawling my eyes out. My mum, knowing what I was like, drove an hour back to the op-shop just so I could pay the lady 50 cents and take this deer home.”</p> <p>She still has the op-shop deer. “Once they come home with me they never leave, that’s why I have 150.”</p> <p>Overall, the Powerhouse exhibition is a way for Hayden’s fans to see all her passions together, in material form and not just in a 30-second reel. “I think there are definitely things that people who don’t know me intimately would go, ‘That’s an interesting choice’ but people that know me would go, ‘This is the most Chloé exhibit you could ever think of.’”</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://powerhouse.com.au/program/powerhouse-materials-textiles\">Powerhouse Materials: Textiles</a> is at Powerhouse Castle Hill from 28 June to 9 November</em></p></li> </ul>",

Since last week, finding out what is happening overseas and if it is affecting their families has become a shared obsession.</p> <p>While sitting next to each other at work, they keep track of the rolling live coverage.

I feel so guilty, and even though obviously I’m not responsible for the actions of the Israeli government, but nevertheless, it really pains me to just see even more suffering being inflicted.”</p> <p>“I don’t want people to become desensitised to what is happening in the region, and the … scale of pain that is taking place every day. It’s getting worse.”</p> <h2>A sense of numbness</h2> <p>By Friday, Israeli strikes on Iran had killed at least 657 people and wounded 2,037 others, according to Washington-based group Human Rights Activists. Of those dead, the group identified 263 civilians and 164 security force personnel.</p> <p>Iran has not given regular death tolls during the conflict and has minimised casualties in the past. In its last update, delivered last Monday, it put the death toll at 224 people and 1,277 wounded.</p> <p>According to the latest figures cited by Israel’s health ministry on Thursday morning, there have been no casualties yet from Iranian missile strikes on Israel. The Associated Press reported that at least 240 people had been wounded.</p> <p>Salemi says she has not heard from her family since the Iranian authorities blocked the internet.</p> <p>“My auntie woke up in the middle of the night thinking that she was having a heart attack because the initial missile was so close to where she lived,” she says.</p>    <p>“I haven’t heard from my family members in 36 hours, and there’s a great sense of numbness when you worry that maybe that’s the last time you’ve ever heard from your family members,” she says.</p> <p>Oscar says he sometimes has difficulty reaching his parents by phone to check in on how they are. He struggled with the news that a hospital – where his nan had gotten care once after she had a stroke – had been hit by an Iranian rocket.</p> <p>Salemi says while the bombs are falling from Israel, she also blames the Iranian regime – unpopular among many – for failing to protect its people.

Making a feature-length anime the old-fashioned way may require a large and multitalented cast, but Miyazaki is the thread running through Ghibli’s creative genius.</p> <p>Now, as the studio marks its 40th anniversary, it faces an uncertain future, amid renewed speculation that its figurehead auteur really has wielded his pencil for the last time.</p> <p>Roland Kelts, a visiting professor at the school of culture, media and society at Waseda University, said Ghibli had failed to anticipate a time when Miyazaki, who is 84, would no longer be at the helm, even after the succession question grew more urgent following the death in 2018 of co-founder Isao Takahata.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/16/the-glassworker-studio-ghibli-movie-sbs-on-demand-pakistan\">The Glassworker: Studio Ghibli’s legacy lives in Pakistan’s first hand-drawn feature</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead, the studio shifted its focus to commercial activities. “The studio failed to produce heirs to Miyazaki and Takahata, and now it’s a merchandising monster,” says Kelts, author of <a href=\"https://www.japanamericabook.com/\">Japanamerica</a>: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the US.</p> <p>In 2013, Miyazaki announced that he would no longer make feature-length films, citing the difficulty of living up to his own impossibly high standards.</p>    <p>But four years later, Ghibli said its co-founder had had a change of heart and would make “his final film, considering his age”. The result was The Boy and the Heron, winner of the 2024 Academy Award for best animated film. </p> <p>While Ghibli performs alchemy on the screen, there is nothing it can do to shapeshift itself clear of the march of mortality: Miyazaki’s main colour designer, Yasuda Michiyo, whose work appeared in most of his films, died two years before Takahata, while another co-founder, producer Toshio Suzuki, is 76.</p> <p>As a result, the studio is finally looking ahead to a future without its leading creative light, notwithstanding persistent rumours that Miyazaki is not quite done yet. “Miyazaki is 84 and may not have time to make another movie,” says Kelts.</p> <h2>A cultural phenomenon</h2> <p>The studio was formally established by Miyazaki, Suzuki and Takahata in 1985 – a year after it released the post-apocalyptic Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. It has since become a cultural phenomenon, winning an Oscar in 2003 for Spirited Away, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/10/boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki-oscar-best-animation\">second Oscar in 2024</a> for The Boy and the Heron.</p> <p>Told through the prism of the fantastical, and featuring characters and themes that defy the pigeonholing that underpins much of Hollywood’s output, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/studio-ghibli\">Studio Ghibli</a>’s films are widely considered masterpieces of their genre, earning two Oscars and the devotion of millions of fans across the world.</p> <p>Watching a Ghibli movie is like reading literature, says Miyuki Yonemura, a professor at Japan’s Senshu University who studies cultural theories on animation. “That’s why some children have watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/01/my-neighbour-totoro-review-miyazaki-studio-ghibli\">My Neighbour Totoro</a> 40 times,” she says. “Audiences discover something new every time.”</p> <p>In some ways, Ghibli shares certain values with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/walt-disney-company\">Disney</a>, says Susan Napier, a professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University in the US, believes. “Both are family oriented, insist on high production standards and have distinctive worldviews.</p> <p>“But what is striking about Ghibli is how for the last 40 years the studio has reflected and maintained a set of values and aesthetics that are clearly drawn from its founders and not from a corporate playbook,” adds Napier, author of Miyazakiworld: a Life in Art.</p>    <p>Miyazaki has made no secret of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/hayao-miyazaki-film-wind-rises\">progressive politics</a>, informed by his experience living through conflict and postwar austerity, and has publicly criticised attempts by conservative politicians to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/12/shinzo-abe-controversial-vision-japan-constitution\">revise</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a>’s war-renouncing constitution. His films address the themes of war and the environment, but stop short of distilling the narrative into a simple battle of good versus evil.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/08/the-boy-and-the-heron-movie-review-hayao-miyazaki\">Boy and the Heron</a>, for example, opens with Mahito Maki, the 12-year-old protagonist, losing his mother in the US’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/10/great-tokyo-air-raid-firebombing-anniversary-america-survivors\">aerial bombardment of Tokyo</a> in March 1945, in which an estimated 100,000 people died.</p> <p>However, Ghibli’s decades of independence ended in 2023 when the studio was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/22/nippon-tv-acquires-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki\">acquired by Nippon TV</a> – a move that the studio conceded came amid uncertainty over its future leadership.</p> <p>Speculation that Miyazaki’s eldest son, Goro, was heir apparent has dampened since the latter voiced doubt about his ability to run the studio alone, and amid reports that artistic differences had contributed to “strained” relations between father and son.</p> <p>Now it will be up to Nippon TV to develop a pool of directors to gradually replace the old guard, including those with expertise in computer animation, considered anathema to Ghibli’s fierce commitment to hand-drawn frames.</p> <p>Ghibli has at least overcome its squeamishness towards broadening its commercial brief. The Ghibli Museum has been a huge success since it opened in western Tokyo in 2001, while visitors flock to Ghibli Park in central Japan, whose launch in 2022 was seen as an acknowledgment by the studio that it needed to build a brand that went beyond film-making.</p> <p>Now Ghibli merchandise is ubiquitous, from My Neighbour Totoro T-shirts and cuddly character toys to high-end leather handbags inspired by Spirited Away and Levi’s branded Princess Mononoke jackets.</p> <p>Totoro, Miyazaki’s 1988 film set in 1950s rural Japan, was turned into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/oct/19/my-neighbour-totoro-review-barbican-london\">play</a> by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2022. Last year a stage adaptation of Spirited Away received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/09/spirited-away-review-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-coliseum-london\">four-star review</a> in the Guardian.</p> <p>While computer-generated animation and AI make the painstaking, aesthetically stunning animation that Ghibli is renowned harder than it was a generation ago, Napier is not convinced the octogenarian auteur is ready to retire.</p> <p>“I can’t imagine someone like Miyazaki, with his intellectual and artistic vivacity, simply being content to sit around, so who knows?”</p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed reporting</em></p>",

The exchange has sparked a conversation online, with some saying they would never be brave enough to complain and others recounting their worst haircut experiences.</p> <p>Here Guardian Australia writers – in what almost became a group therapy session – tell us about their worst haircuts. You can share yours in the comments below.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graham-readfearn\">Graham Readfearn</a></strong></p> <p>I was in the middle of an almost year-long backpacking trip around the world in 2000. My hair was getting what I’d describe as quite lustrous but my then girlfriend had another word. Anyway, we were in a town somewhere south of Santiago and I gave in and found a barber. I emerged into the Chilean sun looking like the love child of a 1960s Paul McCartney and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/C83V1Sqy84K/?hl=en\">Sharon Strzelecki</a>. At least I didn’t stick out – every other male seemed to have the same haircut. And no, I don’t have pictures.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/janine-israel\">Janine Israel</a></strong></p> <p>When I moved to London, paying for a haircut seemed prohibitively expensive. So I signed up to be a “hair model” (AKA guinea pig) at a fancy salon in Covent Garden. The waiver I signed meant I was handing myself over to the stylist to do whatever they pleased. My hairdresser said he wanted to replicate the hairstyle he’d given the day before to a woman with dead-straight blond hair on my shoulder-length curly brown hair. Then he proceeded to cut my hair to the length and shape of a cheap clown wig, with a bizarre band of 2cm-long tufts around the hairline. It might have looked edgy on the blond but on me it looked like a lawnmower had broken down midway doing through the job, and from the horrified look on the hairdresser’s sweating face, he knew it. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nick-miller-\">Nick Miller</a></strong></p> <p>Quite early in my career at the West Australian newspaper I switched from dark brown to blond hair, for no clear reason I can now remember. They stopped sending me to political doorstops as a brand protection measure. After that I had bright red hair and an eyebrow ring, again I can’t recall why, and they switched me to a desk-bound column job for a while, and the main editorial cartoonist drew a caricature that senior editors shared around afternoon news conference. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/luca-ittimani\">Luca Ittimani</a></strong></p> <p>I went on a TV show and said if I won the trophy I’d get a bowl cut with it. I won, and my mate put the trophy on my head and chopped. I do not have the straight Beatle-style locks required to keep a bowl cut flat so it just looked like half my normal wavy hairdo had gone missing. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/10/experience-barber-hasnt-had-haircut-43-years\">Experience: I’m a barber who hasn’t had a haircut in 43 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I was committed – I kept the cut for nearly a month, the constant expansion of the hair above my ears only accentuated by the absence of anything below. Who knew my forehead could look so big? </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-doherty\">Ben Doherty</a></strong></p> <p>I’ve got a mate who’s a rock star. He’s admirably self-effacing about it but that’s what he is: a bona fide, write-in-on-your-tax-return rock star. We used to kick around in bands together but he was always destined for greater things: his life is now sold-out stadiums across the US, pool parties with the Wu-Tang Clan, his face on T-shirts.</p> <p>Allied to his extraordinary musical talent, this man has an effortless, charming charisma. He went and got a haircut that was very cool at the time: a supremely high buzz cut up the sides, betopped by a cheeky fringe. He wore it, it looked amazing. I thought, “Yeah, I could totally nail that.”</p> <p>I did not nail it. It was awful and aggressive and made me look thuggish. Photos from the time make me cringe. I think I ended up just shaving my head and starting again – chastened and altogether more careful about trying to be cool.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gabrielle-jackson\">Gabrielle Jackson</a></strong></p> <p>I was going through a major life change in London – I’d quit my job and was planning to travel and write a book, so felt I needed a new haircut to reflect the new me. I decided to leave my old hairdresser of many years, thinking she was too edgy and “didn’t get me”. So I tried out a new, very expensive and “trendy” hairdresser in London, who had given a friend the most perfect bob. At this new place they give you a glass of wine before the cut, so the stylist can get to you know you. Overcome by how cool the hairdresser was, I gave my consent to an asymmetrical bob.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q97iIDx-b7U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q97iIDx-b7U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>‘Claire, it’s French!’</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was so bad – everyone I knew just stared at me dumbfounded.

Six days a week, from before dawn to well after dusk, Wellingtonians converge there to heat up, relax and socialise.</p>    <p>Until recently, New Zealand’s saunas were largely tucked away in upmarket spas, grimy gyms and public pools. But in a new – and perhaps a surprisingly late – addition to the nature-loving nation, saunas are popping up on beaches and in back gardens across the country as New Zealanders embrace the steamy ritual.</p> <p>Over the winter months, temperatures in the North Island top out at 10-15C, while in the South Island it’s more like 8-10 degrees. Some regions dip below zero while in Wellington the fierce southerly winds can make a cool morning feel Arctic.</p> <p>“In the winter, you crave that feeling of being warmed to the bone,” says Natalie Keegan, who is sipping on homemade kefir in a patch of sun after a sauna session.</p> <p>But she says it is about more than escaping the winter cold. Keegan loves the sauna because it fosters community, is good for her health and helps her connect with nature.</p> <p>Keegan runs an informal WhatsApp group for roughly 40 women who come together every full moon to sauna and ocean swim.</p> <p>“It’s like a coven,” she laughs. “You’re in a space together sweating, your body is feeling extreme heat, you’re able to talk about things you might not usually bring up.

It’s all a bit grim out there – even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/18/munsters-monster-hits-shows-why-queensland-captains-time-has-come\">State of Origin</a> is struggling to hit its usual high notes. Here’s the pick of what I’ve been reading to tune out.</p> <h2>1. The evangelical men who saved sex for marriage – and regretted it</h2>    <p>The US “true love waits” movement was a phenomenon in the 1990s, inspiring Bill Clinton to spend tens of millions funding abstinence-only sex education. George W Bush doubled down, despite mounting evidence it didn’t reduce teen sexual activity.</p> <p>Matt (not his real name), who grew up in a fundamentalist Christian household of that time and was “terrified” by the idea of sexual sin, had not had a relationship nor a sexual partner by his 40th birthday. He vented his frustration online. And of course, he was offered a solution: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/17/evangelical-sex-marriage\">the Purity Culture Dropout Program</a>.</p> <p><strong>Policy failure? </strong>Seventeen US states still offer abstinence-only sex ed – and they have higher-than-average teen pregnancy rates.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Ten minutes.</p> <h2>2. Online dating and the ‘6ft fixation’</h2>    <p>Meanwhile, Tinder is trialling a height filter in some markets and the dating app’s shorter in stature men are feeling aggrieved (though the app said profiles that don’t match the selected height criteria will not be blocked outright).</p> <p>Discrimination, or a vital tool to help women satisfy an “evolutionary drive” to find a taller partner? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/18/the-shorter-mans-search-for-love-one-woman-cried-when-i-told-her-how-tall-i-am\">Leah Harper investigates</a>.</p> <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>According to the dating app Badoo, the top word in profiles for men to get matches is “6ft” – for women, it is “love”.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Five minutes.</p> <h2>3. ‘The lesson of 1933 is – you get out’</h2>    <p>The US history professor Marci Shore, her husband and a colleague made headlines last month with what in ordinary times would be an innocuous move from Yale to the University of Toronto. Part of her reasoning – a fear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/why-a-professor-of-fascism-left-the-us-the-lesson-of-1933-is-you-get-out\">the US is “headed to civil war”</a>.</p> <p>Shore argues Donald Trump has an approach to politics “in which all of the ugliness is right on the surface”. But, in conversation with Jonathan Freedland, she offers the world the possibility of optimism.</p> <p>***</p> <p>“Without a distinction between truth and lies, there is no grounding for a distinction between good and evil.”</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Five minutes.</p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong>How Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/trump-us-autocracy-authoritarianism\">propelling the US towards authoritarianism</a> at an “alarming speed”.</p> <h2>4. Do we ever really know what our pets are thinking?</h2>    <p>Studies suggest cats and dogs are capable of reading human emotions. From not recognising what different cat miaows mean to assuming a dog who has just torn up a cushion feels guilt (rather than fear at their human’s reaction), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/15/the-secret-psychology-of-dogs-and-cats-do-we-ever-really-know-what-they-are-thinking\">turns out we’re not as advanced as our furry friends</a>.</p> <p>Sam Pyrah – owner of Morris, her nomination for best dog in the world – asks the experts how we can be better.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Ten minutes.</p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/19/raccoons-german-city-kassel-wild-population-europe-aoe\">The raccoons that conquered a German city</a>.</p> <h2>5. Miranda July on the reaction to All Fours</h2>    <p>In her hit novel All Fours, Miranda July’s heroine blows up her life after an encounter with a young dancer on a road trip. July herself separated from her husband two years before the book’s publication and has a child roughly the same age as the narrator’s.</p> <p>So is All Fours real life, or just fantasy? As Zoe Williams discovers, even July’s closest friends are fuzzy on the detail. Says the author of its creation: “The joy of it, for me, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/14/all-fours-author-miranda-july-interview-sex-power-and-giving-women-permission-to-blow-up-their-lives\">writing a thing I hadn’t seen written</a> about sex.”</p> <p><strong>Sample reaction: </strong>One woman who nearly divorced her husband after reading it said: “I think what I felt, which I think is what a lot of us feel, is permission to be undone.”</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Seven minutes.</p> <h2>Sign up</h2> <p>If you would like to receive these Five Great Reads to your email inbox every weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories?CMP=copyembed\">sign up here</a>.

            "body" : "<p>Swag is a word more common in the US than in this corner of the world. It’s a made-to-measure term for athletes with attitude as well as talent; a bit of showmanship to go with the substance. It helps sell the product. When we think of the Lions we like the idea of a bit of swag to go with the occasional success.</p> <p>Scott Gibbs for example, on the 1997 winning tour to South Africa, the trip that rescued the idea of four countries merging into one and still having a relevance in the newly professionalised game. Or Brian O’Driscoll’s stunning impact on his first tour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/27/british-and-irish-lions-series-australia-rugby-union\">in Australia in 2001</a>. George North did the same thing in the same country in 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/british-and-irish-lions-argentina-international-rugby-union-friendly-match-report\">Lions handed wake-up call as Argentina hang on to edge thrilling win in Dublin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So this opener was the first audition of who might put their hand up in Australia 2025. On the basis of his exploits on this pitch with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/03/leinster-northampton-european-rugby-champions-cup-semi-final-match-report\">Northampton Saints against Leinster in the Champions Cup</a> semi-final last month you had to consider Tommy Freeman before the stalls even opened. This game was only 10 minutes old when his mate Fin Smith cross-kicked perfectly to him, 10 metres from the Argentina line, only for Ignacio Mendy to intercept the ball brilliantly in mid- air. Otherwise Freeman could have lodged a claim that the north-east corner of Lansdowne Road should have a plaque with his name on it. Two of his three touchdowns against Leinster came on that little patch of land.</p> <p>The gate to that corner was closed to him thereafter. One of the issues with modern Lions tours is that every minute of game time is one where you have to live your most productive life, for everything up to the first Test is about making the cut for that Test. Sometimes players force stuff. England’s wing might want to relive at least one of his offloads, and reshape it more conservatively. He will have lost a night’s sleep too over spilling a ball he should have held as the Lions came around the final bend still a few points off the pace, but he finished the night well ahead.</p> <p>Freeman’s England teammates, the Smiths, were not quite on the same track. The idea of Marcus as full-back is weighed down with risk, either defending in the air or against bigger men on the ground. It negates all the good stuff he brings in attack.</p>    <p>Fin is a different story, though. There was a moment in the first half where he was asked to cover the ground quickly to collect a Puma punt that was certain to involve full-on frontal contact: the sort that might end your participation. He didn’t blink. When all the other bits of your game are very good, and you layer on that level of bravery, it’s a step towards being part of the bigger picture. In the battle for the keys to No 10 it was a very good night for him.</p> <p>Not so Duhan van der Merwe. When the wing was replaced by Mack Hansen for the final quarter the timing looked unfortunate. Surely it was planned, but hardly intended to follow a brilliant try for Santiago Cordero that started with Van der Merwe losing an aerial challenge. As the home crowd roared their approval at the arrival of Hansen, one of Andy Farrell’s favourite players, it must have felt like a long walk for Van der Merwe. All night he looked like a man waiting for the right cards to be dealt only to constantly end up with bum hands. Lions tours demand the ability to make the most of what comes your way, and Scotland’s wing was well short.</p> <p>He is unlikely to feature on our swag list either way, but Tadhg Furlong is still very much a contender. All season Ireland’s tighthead has been getting on the wrong bus, and getting off at the next stop. To have arrived at this point in one piece is an achievement. So a 20-minute spin was about right, but he made it the busiest 20 minutes he has put together in quite a while. He went off for a head injury assessment with the game slipping into its 81st minute, but had sufficient clarity of thought to stop replacement Finlay Bealham – another man who will be happy with his game – to impart some information that was relevant to how the Lions might claw the game back. Whatever it was, it probably needed more time. A bit like the Lions. The award for swagman is up for grabs.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has said that his country is ready for more diplomacy with the US only if Israel’s war on his country is brought to an end “and the aggressor is held accountable for the crimes he committed”.</p> <p>After several hours of talks with European foreign ministers in Geneva on Friday, there was no sign of a diplomatic breakthrough – or a resumption of negotiations with the US.</p> <p>Araghchi said: “Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again and once the aggression is stopped and the aggressor is held accountable for the crimes committed. We support the continuation of discussion with [Britain, France, Germany and the EU] and express our readiness to meet again in the near future.”</p> <p>Late on Friday, Donald Trump said he was unlikely to press Israel to scale back its campaign to allow negotiations to continue.</p> <p>“I think it’s very hard to make that request right now. If somebody is winning, it’s a little bit harder to do than if somebody is losing, but we’re ready, willing and able, and we’ve been speaking to Iran, and we’ll see what happens,” he said.</p> <p>Araghchi said he was willing to continue talks with his European counterparts since they have not supported Israel’s attacks directly. But he said Iran was “seriously concerned over the failure of the three countries to condemn Israel’s act of aggression” and would continue to exercise its right to “legitimate defence”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/israels-gamble-on-force-could-push-iran-to-accelerate-nuclear-plans\">Israeli strikes have not knocked out Iran’s nuclear programme - or its nuclear ambitions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also said Iran’s capabilities, including its missile capabilities, are non-negotiable, and could not form part of the talks, a rebuff to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/macron-lays-out-broad-offer-for-iran-to-end-war-with-israel\">who in an earlier statement said they should be included in the talks</a>.</p> <p>With Israeli <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/israel-warns-hezbollah-not-to-get-involved-in-conflict-with-iran\">diplomats and military commanders warning of a “prolonged war”</a>, the route to direct talks between the US and Iran remains blocked, leaving the European countries as intermediaries.</p> <p>After Friday’s talks between Araghchi and his British, French and German counterparts, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “This is a perilous moment, and it is hugely important that we don’t see regional escalation of this conflict.”</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said there “can be no definitive solution through military means to the Iran nuclear problem. Military operations can delay it but they cannot eliminate it”.</p> <p>The talks are being held against the backdrop of Trump’s threat that the US could launch its own military assault on Iran within a fortnight – a step that would probably turn the already bloody war into a full-scale regional conflagration.</p> <p>European diplomats said they came to talks to deliver a tough message from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and special envoy, Steve Witkoff: that the threat of US military action is real but that a “diplomatic pathway remains open”.</p> <p>But without direct talks between the US and Iran it is hard to see how an agreement can be reached to curtail Iran’s nuclear programme in a way that satisfies the US headline demand that Iran must never have a nuclear bomb.</p> <p>Trump suggested that European efforts would not be enough to bring any resolution. He said: “Iran doesn’t want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this.”</p> <p>The European ministers said they had expressed their longstanding concerns about Iran’s expansion of its nuclear programme, “which has no credible civilian purpose and is in violation of almost all provisions in the nuclear deal agreed in 2015”.</p> <p>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Today the regional escalation benefits no one. We must keep the discussions open.”</p> <p>Earlier on Friday, Macron said the European offer to end Israel’s war would include an Iranian move to zero uranium enrichment, restrictions on its ballistic missile programme and an end to Tehran’s funding of terrorist groups.</p> <p>The proposals were surprisingly broad, spanning a range of complex issues beyond Iran’s disputed nuclear programme, and appeared likely to complicate any solution unless an interim agreement can be agreed.</p> <p>One proposal recently aired is for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment for the duration of Trump’s presidency. The concept of uranium enrichment being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/iran-proposes-partnership-with-uae-and-saudi-arabia-to-enrich-uranium\">overseen by a consortium of Middle East countries</a> – including Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – remains on the table.</p> <p>Macron, already accused by Trump of publicity seeking this week, set out a daunting agenda. “It’s absolutely essential to prioritise a return to substantial negotiations, including nuclear negotiations to move towards zero [uranium] enrichment, ballistic negotiations to limit Iran’s activities and capabilities, and the financing of all terrorist groups and destabilisation of the region that Iran has been carrying out for several years,” he said.</p> <p>In the previous five rounds of talks, the US insisted that Iran end its entire domestic uranium enrichment programme, but said it would allow Iran to retain a civil nuclear programme, including by importing enriched uranium from a multinational consortium.</p> <p>Iran claims that as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, it has an absolute legal right to enrich uranium, a position neither the European nor American powers have endorsed. In the past, European negotiators have proved more adept than their US partners in finding compromises, including the temporary suspension of domestic enrichment, a principle Tehran reluctantly endorsed between 2003 and 2004.</p>",

After all the hype, buzz and anticipation, the 2025 Lions tour is about to get under way. </p> <p>Before the squad fly out to Australia, there’s the small matter of a tough warm-up match against Argentina, ranked fifth in the world, at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. It will be the first time the Lions have played in Ireland, a historic occasion which the squad’s 16-strong Irish contingent will be especially keen to mark with a win. Tadhg Beirne, who will start at lock, has said as much, telling the press: “For us Irish players it’s extra special and means a lot.” Beirne was part of the Ireland side that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/15/ireland-argentina-autumn-nations-series-match-report-rugby-union\">narrowly beat Argentina 22-19</a> at the Aviva last November, a result which hints at just how tough this game could be.</p> <p>While the Pumas’ last outing was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/22/france-see-off-argentina-to-round-off-their-perfect-autumn\">a 37-23 defeat to France</a> soon afterwards, their three wins at the Rugby Championship last year – against New Zealand in Wellington, Australia in Santa Fe and South Africa in Santiago del Estero – are a better measure of their mettle. Expect brutal forward play and threats across the back line.</p> <p>As for the Lions, it’s early days.

            "body" : "<p>The 2025 British &amp; Irish Lions tour is up and running but here was an abrupt reminder that not everything can be perfectly choreographed. This proved to be anything but a routine sendoff for the Lions coaches and players, who already have a good deal to reflect on as they head for Perth this weekend to embark on their eagerly awaited Australian tour.</p> <p>Should they win the Test series 3-0, of course, this pre-departure ­wake-up call will rate as only a minor footnote in the great scheme of things. The Wallabies, nevertheless, will have taken due note of both the historic result and the positive manner with which Argentina approached the ­contest. The Pumas, despite the absence of some first-choice players, led by 11 points at half-time and were good value for their history-making win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/freeman-and-van-der-merwe-miss-chance-to-make-impression-in-tough-lions-opener\">Freeman and Van der Merwe miss chance to make impression in tough Lions opener | Brendan Fanning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe, one day, the Lions will find it in their hearts – and wallets – to agree to a full tour of South America which, on this evidence, would be a guaranteed crowd pleaser.</p> <p>As for the Lions, playing in Ireland for the first time, it is too early to draw hard and fast individual ­conclusions, but Tadhg Beirne and Sione Tuipulotu will both be influential figures in Australia and the two starting props, Ellis Genge and Finlay Bealham, showed up well in the set scrums.</p> <p>Pre-departure games, though, can give and take away and this result was another example. “We made it a tough game, didn’t we?” the Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. “Congratulations to Argentina, who thoroughly deserved to win. [But] the story of the game is that we made too many errors. We need to be better than that. Losing hurts, especially in this jersey. We need to find a solution pretty quickly and be honest with ourselves.”</p> <p>At least the post-game injury ­bulletins were OK. Four years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/26/lions-japan-match-report-alun-wyn-jones\">Alun Wyn Jones was ruled out of the early stages</a> of the tour after damaging a shoulder against Japan at ­Murrayfield and the possibility of being sidelined before the plane south has left the runway inevitably hung in the humid evening air.</p>    <p>The calibre of the opposition, though, created little margin for error. The Pumas may not have been absolutely at full strength but whenever Pablo Matera, Juan-Martín González and Julián Montoya take the field they are never less than fully committed. The pace of the game certainly bore little resemblance to a gentle friendly.</p> <p>Luke Cowan-Dickie came close to an opening try only to lose control of the ball in the act of scoring and, after Tomás Albornoz and Fin Smith had swapped a penalty apiece, it was the Pumas who seized the initiative thanks to a nicely taken 11th minute try by their speedy left wing Ignacio Mendy.</p> <p>The Lions also had a second potential score by Tuipulotu correctly ruled out for a prior knock-on but their cohesion was steadily improving, helped by the established England half-back pairing of Alex Mitchell and Smith. Both were involved, along with full-back Marcus Smith, in ­keeping a promising move alive before the physical Bundee Aki took the most direct available route to the try-line.</p> <p>These are clearly early days but Tuipulotu looks to be the kind of player any centre would love to play alongside and the calmly assured Smith also looked at ease in the same red jersey worn by his grandfather, Tom Elliot, on the 1955 tour to South Africa.</p>    <p>The scrum was also a positive area, in contrast to an initially misfiring lineout but, ultimately, too many balls hit the deck for comfort. There was another example on the stroke of half-time when Duhan van der Merwe, desperate to impress, lost the ball and the Pumas took gleeful advantage, Carreras releasing ­Albornoz for a swallow-dive score 75 metres upfield.</p> <p>The 21-10 interval scoreline demanded a swift response, which duly materialised within five minutes of the restart. The Lions opted to trust their driving maul with the line in sight and a concerted surge gave the opposing pack little option but to drag it down, costing them a penalty try and 10 minutes in the sin bin for Mayco Vivas.</p> <p>The raft of Lions subs also brought fresh energy and, soon enough, they were back ahead. Genge came charging through the middle in proper rhino fashion and, eventually, Beirne added the finishing gloss. The Pumas, though, also found a second wind and another daring break-out raid from deep yielded their third try of the night courtesy of the pacy Santiago Cordero. If the Australian leg of the tour is equally full of thrills and spills, the next few weeks will be excellent viewing.</p> <p>It was also a more than decent occasion which further underlined the power of one of rugby’s most evocative brands. Even Munster fans would have been impressed by the sea of red jerseys all around the Aviva and, despite some punchy ticket prices, the attendance was a 51,700 sellout. The final result, though, will inevitably be the abiding memory.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>There are moments in any Super League season that can feel pivotal. Some are good, some are bad: some can even prove to be a false dawn and merely turn out to be indifferent. But if St Helens are to achieve anything this year, there is one moment here that will certainly rank as season-defining.</p> <p>Paul Wellens’ side, just as they have been for most of 2025, were nothing special in the opening half-hour against a Leeds team with genuine Grand Final aspirations once again. These two sides have 18 Super League titles between them but recently, there has been only one who has looked like claiming another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/15/wakefield-leigh-super-league-rugby-league-match-report\">Leigh solidify top-four spot after Ofahengaue’s late try sees off Wakefield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe that perception will not change over the summer. But if it does, you can pinpoint one particular moment in this win. Not a try, not a kick, but a sensational tackle from the Saints’ newest teenage sensation, Harry Robertson, that denied Ryan Hall an interception score which would have put Leeds in front here.</p> <p>Had that happened, it was not outlandish to suggest the Rhinos would have gone on to win and inflict more misery on Wellens and the Saints. But in truth, Robertson’s effort summed up the many positives about this St Helens display which was built on effort, grit and determination: qualities they have lacked too often this year.</p> <p>Those traits proved to be enough to capitalise on an off-night from the Rhinos and reduce the gap between the two sides to just a solitary win. One tackle does not make a summer, as it were, but this is at least a start in convincing the doubting St Helens public that Wellens has the credentials to turn this team around.</p> <p>“I thought we were really tough, really gritty and we needed to be,” Wellens said. “To keep a team as potent to Leeds as four points is exceptional. Huge credit to the boys.”</p> <p>Two penalties from Kyle Feldt and a well-worked Deon Cross try were enough to put the Saints 8-0 ahead at half-time, but the big moment came in between all of that.</p>    <p>Tristan Sailor’s loose pass was scooped up by Hall and Leeds, who hadn’t really had a sniff to that point, looked certain to level the scores, with a kick to go ahead. The Hall of a few years ago perhaps would have finished with ease, but Robertson seared across the pitch and made an exceptional cover tackle to bundle Hall into touch.</p> <p>The reaction from the Saints players said it all about the mood they were in. From that moment on, you always felt they would do enough. Riley Lumb’s try seven minutes after the break briefly halved the deficit for Leeds and gave them hope, but they were some way below the standards we have come to expect from the Rhinos this year.</p> <p>Their first defeat in six did not sit well with their coach, Brad Arthur. “It’s a good kick up the backside,” he said. “Maybe we thought we were going better than we thought we were. That’s a reflection of our attitude.” Lumb’s try proved nothing more than false hope in the end, as the Saints responded in style.</p> <p>A perfectly executed scrum play saw another exciting homegrown product, Owen Dagnall, cross for his second try in as many games. How Wellens, himself a junior product of this club and one of their great players, must have enjoyed a moment like that – as well as Robertson’s incredible try-saving heroics.</p> <p>Dagnall’s score made it 14-4 and in truth, an error-strewn Leeds never looked capable of overturning that deficit with 10 minutes remaining. In fact, it was the Saints who finished stronger, as Sailor crossed for a deserved try on the hooter.</p> <p>We will only know in the weeks ahead what this result means for the Saints. That is now four wins in five for them. But they needed a scalp against a real contender to make people notice that all is not lost yet for one of Super League’s great clubs in 2025.</p>",

Fixed points in a universe changing unstoppably for the worse have that effect on you.</p> <p>Edmonds bestrode the world of 80s and 90s light entertainment like a Tiggerish colossus, presenting everything from Top of the Pops to Multi-Coloured Swap Shop to Telly Addicts – oh, how well I remember watching the latter as a woman proposed to her boyfriend and how beautifully Noel covered the deafening silence where the horrified man’s acceptance was supposed to go – to Noel’s House Party (let us hope Mr Blobby is ageing as well as his mentor), and more, including his last big hit Deal Or No Deal. He became a bit of a laughing stock when he tried to share with the world his discovery, via his reflexologist, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/apr/04/broadcasting.comment\">cosmic ordering</a> (an iteration of positive thinking woowoo) but never – I think at this point uniquely among his peers – coming a vilely scandalous cropper at any stage. </p> <p>He was last seen on our screens being voted off 2018’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here. After that, he used some of the money restored to him after he won a huge case against bankers who had deliberately bankrupted his company group to buy an 800-acre estate in New Zealand and relocate there with his wife (“my earth angel”) Liz. Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure marks his return to television and chronicles their life running what he hopes will become a popular retreat, complete with vineyard, watering hole the Bugger Inn, spectacularly good views and spectacularly bad puns.</p>    <p>“I am rocking!” he says, and is eager to share with us the secrets of his youthful mien; “tranquil power” workouts in the gym, crystal healing (vibrations at 5-8Hz, obviously, or it doesn’t work), structural water (post-electromagnetised, in case you are not au fait), twice weekly stints in a hyperbaric chamber, and a big statue in the garden that watches over him. “All we are is body energy systems,” he … is “explains” the word? “They touch everything around us. Which is how you move into the bigger matrix, the universal energy system.” You know what? I loved Noel’s House Party. And nothing has ever made me cry happier tears than Noel’s Christmas Presents, perfectly-pitched every year on the side of “warm glow” rather than “mawkish sentiment”. He’s earned this.</p> <p>He remains unassailably himself – emotional, childlike, open (the curiosity/credulousness that lets you embrace cosmic ordering is also what allows you to connect with people and find something interesting about them all), confident and professional. The last isn’t an add-on but a part of what made him great. As he puts it at one point, he worked hard and took it seriously. He has an old-school respect for his audience and isn’t about to let them down. To watch him now is to be reminded how much contempt there is threaded through our entertainment, our culture now and what we have been reconditioned to accept as the norm. He also remains unafraid of the long march towards a terrible joke, as attested by the scene in which he lowers himself into a cold plunge bath. “It should have been three degrees! Because when will I see them – Mr Happy and the twins! – again?”</p> <p>If you were anything other than a wholly committed hater of the man before, you will follow him just as willingly as you did decades ago, this time through bad Kiwi weather instead of ill-fated proposals, money troubles instead of swaps, and chaos caused by tabloids instead of Mr Blobby (though we are promised a visit from the latter).</p> <p>When the estate reopens for the season, a local customer is asked for his opinion on the new landlord. “Seems like a good bugger,” he replies. So he does, so he does.</p> <p>Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure airs on ITV1 on 20 June and ITVX.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a> has terminated 639 employees at Voice of America and its parent organization in the latest round of sweeping cuts that have reduced the international broadcasting service to a fraction of its former size.</p> <p>The mass terminations announced Friday rounds out the Trump-led elimination of 1,400 positions since March and represents the near-complete dismantling of an organization founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, whose first broadcast declared: “We bring you voices from America.”</p> <p>Just 250 employees now remain across the entire parent group the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), who operated what was America’s primary tool for projecting democratic values globally.</p> <p>“For decades, American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency that’s been riddled with dysfunction, bias and waste. That ends now,” said Kari Lake, Trump’s senior advisor to USAGM, in <a href=\"https://x.com/KariLake/status/1936085141589500195\">Friday’s termination announcement</a>.</p> <p>VOA once reached 360 million people weekly across dozens of languages, former USAGM CEO and director John Lansing <a href=\"https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/19994-national-security-archive-028-statement-john\">told Congress in 2019</a>. In March, the White House<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/the-voice-of-radical-america/\"> put out a statement</a> calling the outlet “propaganda”, “leftist” and dubbed it “The Voice of Radical America”. One of the examples cited to justify that explanation was VOA’s refusal to use the term “terrorist” to describe members of Hamas unless in statements, which falls in line with common and basic journalistic practice.</p> <p>The cuts represent a major retreat from America’s Cold War strategy of using broadcasting to reach audiences behind the iron curtain. VOA had evolved from its wartime origins to become a lifeline for populations living under authoritarian rule, providing independent news and an American perspective in regions where press freedom is under assault.</p> <p>The layoffs also came just days after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/media/voice-of-america-iran-israel-trump\">VOA recalled Farsi-speaking journalists</a> from administrative leave to cover the war between Israel and Iran, after Israel shot missiles at Tehran less than a week ago in the dead of night.</p> <p>“It spells the death of 83 years of independent journalism that upholds US ideals of democracy and freedom around the world,” said three VOA journalists, Patsy Widakuswara, Jessica Jerreat and Kate Neeper, who are leading legal challenges against the demolition, in a statement.</p> <p>The agency’s folding began in March when Trump signed an executive order targeting federal agencies he branded as bloated bureaucracy, and VOA staff were placed on paid leave and broadcasts were suspended.</p> <p>Lake, Trump’s handpicked choice to run VOA, had previously floated plans to replace the service’s professional journalism with content from One America News Network (OANN), a rightwing pro-Trump network that would provide programming without charge.</p> <p>The sole survivor of the cull is the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, which transmits into Cuba from Florida. All 33 employees there remain, according to the announcement.</p> <p>USAGM offered voluntary departure packages through what it termed a “Fork in the Road” program, providing full pay through September plus benefits. Some 163 employees accepted the buyouts rather than face involuntary termination, the agency said in a press release.</p> <p>Federal courts have allowed the administration to proceed with the terminations while legal challenges continue for now.</p> <p>The VOA cuts form part of Trump’s broader assault on the federal workforce, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html\">tens of thousands terminated</a> across agencies including the IRS, Social Security Administration, USAID, and departments of education, health and agriculture.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It would be easier for Chelsea to rationalise the humiliation of being swatted aside by Flamengo if another statement win for South America could be attributed solely to Nicolas Jackson’s latest rush of blood to the head. Unfortunately, this was also a dreadful afternoon for Enzo Maresca, who got his tactics wrong and somehow found a way to produce the self-sabotage of treating the Lincoln Financial Field to a masterclass on how to neutralise Cole Palmer.</p> <p>So much for all the hype about Palmer taking the No 10 shirt. Why leave him isolated on the right? Palmer yearned for his normal central role and he did not look impressed when he went off in the 82nd minute, by which point Flamengo were 2-1 up, in possession of a one-man advantage and presumably very happy to see Maresca remove Chelsea’s likeliest source of salvaging something from the wreckage of their six-minute implosion midway through the second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/club-world-cup-didnt-start-fire-expanding-overlapping\">Club World Cup didn’t start the fire – it didn’t light it but we’ll try to fight it | Max Rushden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that Chelsea deserved anything other than a defeat that leaves their hopes of reaching the knockout phase of the Club World Cup as winners of Group D in peril. Maresca’s lineup was weirdly clunky – he decided to forgo width by dropping Noni Madueke and moving Reece James into a stolid midfield – and he was outsmarted by Flamengo’s manager, Filipe Luís.</p> <p>Some substitutions win you games; some lose them. For Flamengo there was a stunning contribution from Bruno Henrique, who was thrown on in the 56th minute and in the right place to equalise six minutes later. Chelsea, on the other hand, were left trying to make sense of Jackson’s indiscipline. The striker came on for Liam Delap in the 64th minute, watched Danilo give Flamengo the lead moments later, and then picked up a red card for a crude lunge on Ayrton Lucas four minutes after entering the field of play.</p>    <p>It seems nothing has been taken on board in the six weeks since Jackson was sent off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/newcastle-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">for elbowing Newcastle United’s Sven Botman</a>, in a game that threatened to derail Chelsea’s push for Champions League qualification. This was the Senegal forward’s second red card in four appearances and if this is how he intends to respond to competition from Delap then he cannot expect Maresca to trust him with the responsibility of leading the line for Chelsea.</p> <p>A heartfelt apology on Instagram did little to repair the damage caused by Jackson, whose one-game ban could be upgraded by Fifa. “It happened against Newcastle, it happened today,” Maresca said. “I am not 100% sure it is a red card compared to the Newcastle one. It is a bad moment for Nico. He will be out for a while. Nico apologised.”</p> <p>The folly typified Chelsea’s lack of control. Flamengo, who are top of the Brazilian league, played with more balance and imagination. Wesley flew forward from right-back and Gerson was outstanding in attacking midfield. Gonzalo Plata finished with two assists and Jorginho, the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder, pulled the strings with his clever switches of play from deep.</p> <p>The South American sides are not to be underestimated. They remain unbeaten and Chelsea only needed to look at Botafogo beating Paris Saint-Germain to appreciate that this was going to be nothing like their opening win over Los Angeles FC.</p> <p>Flamengo’s fans were out in force in the Philadelphia sun. The intensity rattled Chelsea. Their passing was erratic and Maresca’s tweaks backfired. He brought Malo Gusto in at right-back, started with James next to Moisés Caicedo in central midfield and pushed Enzo Fernández forward.</p> <p>It left Chelsea without a clear way of going from back to front. They took an early lead when Wesley and Danilo failed to deal with a speculative punt from James, enabling Pedro Neto to race through and score, but there was no flow to their football. Delap, who was handed his full debut, faded after drawing a save from Agustín Rossi.</p> <p>Flamengo have the highest possession in the Brazilian top flight. They probed for long spells. Gerson was a dynamic presence and almost equalised before half-time, only for Levi Colwill to clear his volley off the line.</p> <p>Filipe Luís, the former Chelsea left-back, was proud with how his side responded to going behind. They pushed again at the start of the second half. Caicedo, Fernández and James were out-thought. Gerson and Plata went close. The warning signs were obvious. It was all square when Gerson’s chipped a diagonal ball over Gusto, Plata headed across goal and Bruno Henrique ghosted in to score.</p>    <p>Chelsea collapsed. They were 2-1 down when Danilo, the former Manchester City defender, volleyed in after a corner was flicked on by Bruno Henrique. It was game over when Jackson went off. Wallace Yan, another Flamengo substitute, made it 3-1 with seven minutes left.</p> <p>Maresca must respond. Chelsea have work to do when they face the Tunisian side Espérance in their final group game. Finishing second leaves them at risk of facing Bayern Munich in the last 16. Their stay in the US could be over sooner than expected.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A key vaccine advisory panel reconstituted by health secretary and vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr is slated to discuss thimerosal-containing influenza vaccines in its <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-18.pdf\">first meeting</a> – an ingredient which has been a fixation of anti-vaccine activists for decades.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will hold two separate votes later this month: one on “influenza vaccines” and one on influenza vaccines that contain thimerosal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-safety/thimerosal.html\">Thimerosal</a> is an ethylmercury preservative used in multi-dose vaccine vials to prevent fungi and bacteria growth. The preservative has been studied and deemed <a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOoq1WNVAurLccr0DS6JsokDSHfNNe4jNp5zNVssGUc94yJsRpmUH\">safe</a>, but was nevertheless removed from all routine childhood vaccines in 2001 as a precaution.</p> <p>“I was there when we went through this the first time,” said Dr Paul Offit, director of the vaccine education center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, about debates over the preservative in the early 2000s.</p> <p>Offit served on the ACIP panel in question from 1998 to 2003. He said the issue of thimerosal was vigorously debated and found safe then, prompting him to ask: “What’s the point?”</p> <p>In a short history of the thimerosal controversy published in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078187\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, Offit described how some parents became convinced thimerosal gave their children autism, resulting in thousands of autistic children receiving heavy metal chelation treatments each year.</p> <p>Studies have found no link between thimerosal and autism, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=9c7af333-06b1-4095-8268-6fdfa8a2d2c5\">has also denied</a> claims of a thimerosal-autism link. Kennedy, however, has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thimerosal-Evidence-Supporting-Immediate-Neurotoxin-ebook/dp/B0140EFEWK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0\">written a book </a>arguing against the use of thimerosal.</p> <p>Offit said the discussion of thimerosal appeared to geared to, “accomplish [Kennedy’s] goals of making vaccines less affordable, less accessible and more feared”, he said.</p> <p>“Here’s what you do know – you do know RFK Jr is an anti-vaccine, science-denying conspiracy theorist. He is devoted to this, he is a zealot, there is no middle ground with him,” said Offit. “He believes we have merely substituted infectious diseases for chronic diseases.”</p> <p>The panel’s advisory recommendations are critical because they result in vaccine “schedules”. These schedules are relied on by health insurers to determine which vaccines to cover and by clinicians who use them as an evidence-based guide on immunization – effectively giving the American public access to the medicines.</p> <p>Although the CDC does not always take the panel’s advice, the CDC typically affirms the panel’s decisions. However, the agency is currently <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/does-the-cdc-have-an-acting-director-yes-says-rfkjr/#:~:text=Monarez%2C%20a%20career%20civil%20servant,who%20is%20running%20the%20CDC.\">without a leader</a>, as Senate hearings have not yet been held for nominee and CDC career official Susan Monarez. As a result, Kennedy has signed off on some previous ACIP recommendations.</p> <p>Kennedy wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thimerosal-Evidence-Supporting-Immediate-Neurotoxin-ebook/dp/B0140EFEWK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0\">a book</a> on the preservative thimerosal in 2014 called Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak, in which he argues that “there is a broad consensus among research scientists that thimerosal is a dangerous neurotoxin that should be immediately removed from medicines”. Kennedy said in the book he is “pro-vaccine”.</p> <p>Until 9 June, the ACIP was an independent panel of 17 experts who served staggered terms and were rigorously vetted by career CDC staff. Kennedy broke with tradition when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed\">he fired</a> the entire panel, claiming in a Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAinB5pM4zmkqQp9EfyRAkQ7zATgAtf2E36VU8bEv0nIxTEk0ao0pNOy28u_1P8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6855adbf&amp;gaa_sig=TccNRpwElYKWWnyPHMisFoOT2FdD_EvKobau8dLcVsUS4Yi0rl_aiXefJ1NEtsmlKYN9DWUI_CzFJWn8nDG83w%3D%3D\">editorial</a> that he was working to “restore public trust in vaccines”.</p> <p>The same week, Kennedy appointed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy\">eight new members</a> to the committee, including medical professionals with <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/members-rfk-jr-s-new-vaccine-committee-have-published-little-vaccines\">little vaccine expertise</a> and known vaccine skeptics.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/acp-ama-parents-group-criticize-acip-replacement-vaccine-advisers-rfk-jr-s-selection-process\">wide spectrum</a> of groups criticized the decision, from MomsRising, who said they were “alarmed and disgusted”, to major doctors’ groups such as the <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32475/CDC-vaccine-advisers-scrap-votes-on-some?autologincheck=redirected\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, to public health leaders who described Kennedy’s actions as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed\">a coup</a>,” to the former members of the committee, who warned the independent panel was at “<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2835626?guestAccessKey=c9bd586f-6272-405d-a88d-ed2427ba1281&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=postup_jn&amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&amp;utm_content=olf-tfl_&amp;utm_term=061625\">a crossroads</a>”.</p> <p>The group is scheduled to meet the last week of June. Prior to Kennedy’s changes, they had been expected to discuss reducing the number of shots needed for human papilloma virus (HPV) and a meningococcal vaccine.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the panel released a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-18.pdf\">draft agenda</a> for its upcoming meeting. A wide range of vaccines will be discussed – including those against influenza; the tropical disease chikungunya; the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine; anthrax; Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p> <p>The agenda scheduled a vote on recommendations for flu vaccines, including the multidose versions that still contain thimerosal. These vaccines are used only in adolescents and adults. The panel is also scheduled to vote on recommendations for maternal and pediatric versions of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p> <p>Notably, despite Kennedy’s repeated pledges of “radical transparency”, the draft agenda does not include the names of many speakers, which are listed as “TBD” (to be determined) for instance on “Covid-19 safety update”.</p> <p>New ACIP members have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/disclosures/by-member.html\">not been added</a> to a conflict of interest tracker for ACIP members <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-posts-conflicts-interest-database-vaccine-advisory-group-rcna195362\">developed by</a> the Trump administration. A spokesperson for HHS said the new members ethics agreements “will be made public” before they start work with the committee.</p> <p>In addition to the new draft agenda, there have also been changes to the committee’s meeting times not reflected in the Federal Register, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/vaccines-hhs-kennedy-rfk-thimerosal-mercury-00413199\">Politico</a>. The group will meet for two days instead of three, and there does not appear to be a vote scheduled on Covid vaccines.</p>",

\n  <p>Speaking to reporters following several hours of talks with European foreign ministers in Geneva, Araghchi said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again and once the aggression is stopped and the aggressor is held accountable for the crimes committed... We support the continuation of discussion with [Britain, France, Germany and the European Union] and express our readiness to meet again in the near future.” </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Meanwhile, European foreign ministers told reporters that they urged Iran to hold nuclear talks “without awaiting” an end to Israeli airstrikes. </p> \n  <p>“We invited the Iranian minister to consider negotiations with all sides, including the United States, without awaiting the cessation of strikes, which we also hope for,” French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said. </p> \n  <p>“It is illusory and dangerous to want to impose a regime change from the outside. It is up to the people to decide their own destiny,” Barrot added after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out assassinating Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6855a6ec8f0808294ac4aa84\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrickwintour\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T18:32:39.816Z\">7.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>European foreign ministers and Iran ended four hours of talks in Geneva saying that they were willing to hold further discussions, but there was no sign of a breakthrough or path to reopening of talks between the US and Iran as long as Israel continued to mount its attacks on Iran.</strong></p> \n  <p>Iran insists it will not talk to the US whilst Israel attacks its country accusing the US of being complicit and supportive of the Israeli attacks. </p> \n  <p>Without US-Iran direct talks, it is hard to see how an agreement can be reached to curtail Iran’s nuclear program in a way that satisfies the US’s headline demand that Iran must never have a nuclear bomb. </p> \n  <p>Donald Trump has effectively given the European diplomatic initiative up to a fortnight before he decides whether to join the Israeli bombing campaign, a step that would probably turn the already bloody war into a full scale regional conflagration.</p> \n  <p>With Israeli military officials warning their population to prepare for a long war, the chances for a quick reopening of the US-Iranian negotiations look blocked.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-6855a5cf8f08c39b90a6b52f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T18:22:10.384Z\">7.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">5.1 magnitude earthquake hits Iran</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>A 5.1 magnitude earthquake has struck near the Iranian city of Qom.</strong></p> \n  <p>According to the US government earthquake monitor, the earthquake hit 16 kilometers from Sorkheh, Semnan province on Friday evening.

Always. It’s impossible to keep track of all the football.”</p> <p>You start to imagine Billy Joel rewriting We Didn’t Start the Fire … an endless list of footballers and pundits, of owners and streaming services, of controversies and grimness amid the beauty and joy. Will it ever reach breaking point?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/club-world-cup-storylines-heat-unrest-attendances\">From heat to unrest: how five major Club World Cup storylines are shaping up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To legacy fans (who liked football before the start of June) the Club World Cup may feel like the moment where you switched off, or just didn’t switch on in the first place. If football began yesterday, you’d probably plan it with a tournament with club sides from all over the globe. But football didn’t begin yesterday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwilson\">Jonathan Wilson</a> can tell you exactly when that was. And of course you don’t have to watch this shoehorned land‑grab of a tournament, but sometimes it would be nice to not even have the option.</p> <p>The inflated prize money, where that wealth has come from and the impact huge sums of money going to individual clubs will have on leagues around the world are the start of the problems. Then there’s the fear of the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement service coming to deport a couple of players (or some of those coming to watch). The crowds are, to quote Gennaro Gattuso, “sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit” – more than 400,000 empty seats so far (BBC), 1.5m tickets sold so far for the tournament (Fifa). The tournament overlapping with the Women’s Euros is disgraceful. </p> <p>Careers may be shorter, and we should care about this issue – but how many of us will just support the next guy in the shirt? The reality will be the same whenever players with the potential to reach the peak of the game suffer injury or loss of form. Take Dele Alli or Ansu Fati: we just stop calling them elite and then let them drift from our minds. There will always be top players playing for top clubs. There will always be the best player and so on and so on. Unless players strike it will carry on down the same path.</p> <p>It is obviously easier for neutrals to ignore it. But if you happen to be, say, a Chelsea fan, then part of deal is that you follow your team in their games. Sure there’s a hierarchy of importance – Premier League over Carabao Cup – but it doesn’t feel like you can just keep this file closed. It might the most obvious thing ever written, but if your team is playing, your team is playing.</p>    <p>To criticise the Club World Cup is to be accused of having a Euro- or Anglo-centric view of the game – and that might be fair. “Try telling those Botafogo fans that this doesn’t matter.” The scenes at full time after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/19/inter-miami-porto-lionel-messi-club-world-cup\">their win over PSG</a> were wonderful. Who wouldn’t want to see Lionel Messi score another great free-kick? Do you know what, I’m probably OK.</p> <p>Fifa, the guardian of the game, is plonking this in with little care for elite player welfare or the fans or the women’s game. It is not alone. Uefa enlarged the Champions League; the prize money there already distorts smaller European leagues. The Premier League won’t filter enough money down to the EFL. League Two clubs won’t vote for more teams to come up from the National League. The Club World Cup is just the ultimate example. The notion of the football family is a nice one to cling to. But it only really exists when you can tweet that you care about something that has no material impact on your prospects.</p> <p>This tournament will grow as its history grows. There will always be people who want to watch football because, well, football is great. The danger as always is what comes next: franchise football teams, franchise footballers, a world league, the end of the pyramid. You can’t blame people for just wanting to watch a game without thinking of the greater good, or bad. This is the football you are given, you can watch it if you like.</p> <p>Those of us lucky enough to work in the game should constantly recognise the privilege, and even when I’m complaining about the amount of football, I’m watching Cambridge United’s shirt-reveal video over and over (not because I’m in it, but because Paul Wanless is at the chippy! Steve Fallon is in the Cambridge Blue!) and I’m checking the Spurs transfer gossip. The game has that hold over us, and it is a shame that there are too many people right at the top who want to exploit that.</p> <p>Surely a month off would be good for everyone? Just four or five weeks without VAR, instead the soothing voice of Marais Erasmus rocking and rolling it – that’s hit him outside the line, surely?</p> <p>In the meantime … come on Billy … get out your piano … overwhelm us with just the sheer amount of all this stuff …</p> <p><em>Lionel Messi, Ben Mee, Gianni’s shiny trophy key</em></p> <p><em>Player welfare, PSR, </em><em>Tuesday’s Stoke away</em></p> <p><em>Mick McCarthy, regulator, sportswashing, Opta data</em></p> <p><em>Scrapping replays, Thomas Frank, we are the FSA</em></p> <p><em>(</em><em>Instrumental break)</em></p> <p><em>VAR, Player X, Women’s Euro</em><em>s, Sir Becks</em></p> <p><em>Botafogo, IShowSpeed, Joey Barton’s Twitter feed</em></p> <p><em>Fit and proper owner</em><em>s’ test, Harry Kane needs a rest</em></p> <p><em>City’s charges, gambling sponsors, where’s Ange’s&nbsp;series&nbsp;three?</em></p> <p><em>We didn’t start the fire …</em></p>",

But under fire, the Islamic Republic was impotent to protect its own people, or even its top generals.</p> <p>The Iranian leadership appears to have stuck to the conventional wisdom that Israel could not destroy Iran’s deeply buried facilities such as the underground chambers at Isfahan and more importantly the Fordow enrichment plant, built into the side of a mountain, without US help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/fordow_entrances/giv-32554SYlp6NT5AXQt/\" data-alt=\"Fordow\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/fordow_entrances/giv-32554SYlp6NT5AXQt/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>That assumption, at least, did turn out to be half true. By Monday, Israeli bombs appeared to have burrowed their way down to the Isfahan subterranean facility, but after a week, Israeli officials were still saying they needed US help to do significant damage to Fordow.</p> <p>What Iran did not expect was that Benjamin Netanyahu would start the war without US participation in the attack. Israeli officials said they had received a tacit green light from Donald Trump and guarantees of assistance in defence, though not in offence.</p> <p>By defying expectations and going to war anyway, Israel’s prime minister gained the great advantage of total surprise. Iranian intelligence had been lulled into complacency by plans for a sixth round of US-Iran negotiations due to take place last Sunday, and by Trump’s public remarks warning that an Israel attack would “blow” the chances for his own diplomacy.</p> <p>Iran’s spies would have also noted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/netanyahu-son-wedding-comments-israel-backlash\">Netanyahu’s son’s wedding</a> was due on Monday, and that the prime minister was planning to take a few days off. Surely the long-threatened war would wait.</p>    <p>When the bombs began to fall on Friday then, the shock was absolute. The first wave killed the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Gen Hossein Salami, and the army chief of staff, Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, the nation’s top military commanders, among several generals targeted.</p> <p>Six of Iran’s nuclear scientists were also killed, most if not all by airstrikes on their homes. By the end of the week, the Israelis claimed to have killed 14 scientists in an attempt to wipe out Iran’s nuclear knowhow.</p> <p>In the first sortie, 200 Israeli warplanes hit 100 distinct targets in part of an intricately planned operation, codename Rising Lion, which had been at least eight months in the making.</p> <p>The success Israel had in destroying Iranian air defences in a previous missile strike in October convinced the Israeli leadership that it had opened up a window of opportunity, during which Iran would be uniquely vulnerable, but the window would close over time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/iran-zip/giv-32554IsSLUWSHJ8du/\" data-alt=\"Latest strikes on Iran\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/iran-zip/giv-32554IsSLUWSHJ8du/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Netanyahu said this week that Rising Lion was originally planned for April. However, the timetable was set back two months to allow Trump an opportunity to strong-arm Iran into giving up its enrichment programme at the negotiating table, so he could claim to have averted a new war in the Middle East.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-iran-nuclear-weapons\">a letter in March to Iran’s supreme leader</a>, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Trump gave diplomacy 60 days to produce results and the clock began to tick with the first meeting between American and Iranian negotiators in Oman on 12 April. Last Thursday 12 June, was day 61 on that calendar, and that night the Israeli fighter-bomber squadrons took off for targets 1,000 miles (1,600km) away.</p> <p>Trump later claimed to have been in the loop all along. He bristled at the suggestion that he was merely given a “heads-up”. It was far more than that, he claimed.</p>    <p>It now appears that, having decided to attack after Trump’s 60-day pause, the timetable for Rising Lion was locked in by military requirements. The Mossad special forces and drones had been put in place inside Iran, specifically to target the sinews of Iran’s ability to strike back – its air defence and its ballistic missile launchers. They could not be left behind the lines for long. Their discovery would have compromised the whole operation.</p> <p>In the preceding days, as the rumours of war swirled around the region, Iran boasted it was primed to strike back with devastating effect. In the event, it was hamstrung. The generals who were supposed to give the orders were already dead by the time Iran knew it was under attack.</p> <p>The only Iranian response in the first hours of the war were 100 drones, which were easily shot down by Israel and the US before they reached Israeli territory. By the end of last Friday, Iran’s hastily appointed replacement commanders had scrambled to launch 200 ballistic missiles. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/israel-says-attack-on-iran-just-the-beginning\">Israel was able to intercept most</a> with its multi-tiered, US-supported air defences, with Israeli interceptors rising up in clusters to meet the incoming threat, lighting up the night sky.</p> <p>A handful of Iranian strikes hit home, however, killing Israelis in Tel Aviv and Rishon LeZion who had not sought shelter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/israel-zip/giv-325541HBpURnrDZS8/\" data-alt=\"Strikes on Israel\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/israel-zip/giv-325541HBpURnrDZS8/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Over the course of the first week of the war, the confirmed Israeli death toll had reached 24, less than a 10th of the number of Iranian civilians killed by Israeli pilots striking residential areas in their hunt for regime figures and scientists.</p> <p>In response to the first Israeli casualties, the defence minister, Israel Katz, vowed that “Tehran will burn” if Khamenei continued to fight back with missiles. The Iranian missile salvoes kept coming throughout the week, however, though with smaller numbers in each barrage, as Israel hunted down and destroyed Iranian launchers.</p>    <p>By Friday, IDF briefers claimed to have destroyed two-thirds of the estimated 400 launchers Iran had started the war with, suggesting Israel could be winning the race to blunt Iran’s primary deterrent before Israel ran out of stocks of its most effective and expensive missile interceptor, the Arrow 3.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it was Iranian civilians who took the brunt of the war. Over the course of the week, the roads out of Tehran have been clogged by families using their 25-litre fuel ration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/what-if-the-strikes-hit-us-on-the-highway-thousands-flee-tehran-amid-bombardment\">to try to flee the capital</a>. The obstacles to leaving the city were doubled when one of the main routes out, the road to Qom, was blocked by bombing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/fear-iran-war-tehran-kerman\">Fear and shock in Iran: ‘I’m constantly afraid a missile might hit my home’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the first day of the offensive, it was clear that Israel was aiming at more than Iran’s nuclear and missile programme. A gas refinery on the coast was hit, as was an oil storage facility on the outskirts of Tehran. Israeli leaders have referred to these as “ayatollah regime targets”, the pillars of the Iranian economy.</p> <p>Netanyahu has been increasingly clear that, while regime change was not a formal war aim, it was the desired outcome. Visiting a damaged hospital in Beersheba on Thursday, the prime minister called on Iranians to rise up against their rulers, while Katz declared that Khamenei “cannot continue to exist”.</p> <p>For all the Israeli grandstanding in the wake of a week of constant military successes, the ultimate outcome of the war hung in the balance on Friday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/trump-caution-on-iran-strike-linked-to-doubts-over-bunker-buster-bomb-officials-say\">Trump declared he would take up to two weeks</a> to decide whether he would send in US bombers into the fray, to target Fordow and other hard targets, potentially including Khamenei himself.</p>    <p>The announcement appeared to create an opportunity for diplomacy, with foreign ministers from the UK, France and Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/macron-lays-out-broad-offer-for-iran-to-end-war-with-israel\">meeting their Iranian counterpart in Geneva</a>. It was questionable whether anything short of a complete Iranian surrender of the right to enrich uranium would satisfy Trump, and it would definitely fall short of Israeli demands.</p> <p>With US involvement, the damage inflicted on Iran would undoubtedly be more profound, but it is far from evident it would bring down the Iranian regime.</p> <p>The only real certainty as the war enters it second week, regardless of whether American planes join the Israel air force in the skies over Iran, is that the misery of ordinary Iranians is sure to deepen.</p>",

You have to pick your decisions on that moment, and not things that you did here years ago.“</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/england-india-first-test-day-one-match-report-cricket\">India’s Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal make tons to leave England toiling in first Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tim Southee, the former New Zealand seamer working as England’s bowling consultant, said they had been swayed by the green tinge to the surface on Thursday, before it received its final trim overnight. “With the colour of the wicket yesterday and a little bit of moisture left in it, there was going to be a little bit in it this morning. That was the thinking behind the decision,” he said.</p> <p>“I think there was a little bit of assistance there [in the first hour], but for the rest of the day it was a pretty good surface, which is encouraging for our guys when we get an opportunity to bat. I guess when you win the toss and bowl you expect to make early inroads, but they negotiated that first hour or so pretty well. We’ve got a new ball still, so hopefully tomorrow morning we can make the most of that and make some early inroads.”</p> <p>England’s decision at the toss may have been intended to expose the relative inexperience in these conditions of India’s top order: of the five players to bat on Friday Jaiswal was playing his first Test in this country, Gill his fourth, and Sai Sudharsan – who got a four-ball duck – was making his Test debut.</p> <p>“Credit to the Indian batsmen – Jaiswal and Gill played a couple of great hands there,” Southee said. “They’ve not played a lot of cricket but they’re certainly talented cricketers.”</p>",

Make no mistake: this is an authentic coup for the Premier League champions. How Wirtz came to choose a future in north-west England rather than southern Germany tells us much about the personality, as well as the player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/20/florian-wirtz-liverpool-bayer-leverkusen-club-record-116m-deal\">Florian Wirtz seals Liverpool move from Bayer Leverkusen in club record £116m deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 22-year-old has been in the full glare of the limelight since he was 16. He made the controversial move from Köln to Leverkusen, was fast-tracked to the first team and given a full debut by Peter Bosz to surpass Kai Havertz as the club’s youngest player a fortnight after his 17th birthday. Nineteen days later he became the club’s youngest goalscorer, in a defeat by Bayern. Wirtz has made every stage – becoming a regular starter, playing European football, making his Germany debut at 18 – look easy without the peacocking that often goes with such extravagant talent. When his pre‑Euro 2024 ranking of potato dishes on the German football federation’s TikTok account went viral (he put a “normal” potato at No 1, with much public amusement following), he grumpily remarked: “I don’t find it entertaining at all.”</p> <p>No one needs to tell Wirtz that what he is doing on the pitch is what pays the bills. His father, Hans, is his agent and adviser but Wirtz Jr knows his own mind. Hans had a number of conversations with Bayern’s honorary president, Uli Hoeness, in recent months and it has been reported that when Vincent Kompany felt Florian was not convinced by Bayern’s pitch, Hans convinced his son to sit down with the Bayern brass for one more meeting. Florian agreed to do so but was not swayed. Liverpool remained his choice.</p> <p>A move to Munich would have been understandable, even if it would have been a miserable sight for many Bundesliga fans. Staying in Germany a year before the World Cup and reprising the partnership he has with his friend Jamal Musiala in the national team as dual No 10s under Julian Nagelsmann would have had much to recommend it. Not to mention, as many in Germany have, the possibility of a lighter physical load playing for the most dominant team in the Bundesliga as opposed to the clatter and crunch of a debut season in the Premier League.</p> <p>Wirtz is 5ft 10in but is relatively slight and, having taken 10 months and then plenty of match practice to come back to his best after an anterior cruciate ligament injury in 2022, there is the feeling that he will need to be looked after, protected and carefully managed.</p> <p>This, along with his game-winning ability, is why Alonso said in November 2023 that, while all his Leverkusen players had the remit to interpret their roles as they saw fit, “Flo gets a bit more freedom”. Wirtz has proved worth every bit of that extra licence to thrill, whether as a No 10, or drifting in from an inside‑left position, or even nominally employed as a false 9. Whereas many in his role are there to feed a star striker, his ability to be decisive in any way needed, be it the last pass, the finish or a silky dribble to open up the opposition, means he is the star that the team should revolve around.</p>    <p>He has reached double figures in goals and assists in each of the past two seasons (10 and 12 respectively in the league alone last term) and turns up in the big matches. Wirtz adapted to his first season in the Champions League in 2024-25 as if he had always played there, scoring six times in nine starts before injury curtailed his involvement. It was his hat-trick against Werder Bremen in April 2024 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/14/bayer-leverkusen-clinch-historic-bundesliga-title-with-rout-of-werder-bremen\">that clinched Leverkusen’s first Bundesliga title</a>.</p> <p>He will be stepping into an existing, and winning, hierarchy at Liverpool. His social media rubbishing of reports he wanted Alexis Mac Allister’s No 10 shirt showed his respect for that. Yet it is not a leap to imagine him as an instant key piece. A front three of Wirtz, Mohamed Salah and Luis Díaz or Cody Gakpo would bring the champions in line with the amorphous attacking trios looking set to dominate the Champions League. Wirtz dropping into a 10 role to allow Salah plus one to create a de facto front two could work well, and relieve the Egyptian of some of his creative load.</p> <p>When it comes to a big decision, the Wirtz family take their time. That was the case when he joined Leverkusen in January 2020. Indignant as Köln were – believing their near neighbours had reneged on a tacit agreement not to take one another’s players – they knew Wirtz’s departure was in the post when, as with this move, the player and his family spent time running down the clock before deciding to move 15 minutes up the road to the BayArena.</p> <p>When Wirtz takes his time to make a decision, it usually works out. When it’s time to take the field, he is far more speedy and decisive.</p>",

Gill is one of those rare athletes who works in a different rhythm to the rest of us, so that even when a ball’s coming down at 90mph he seems to be able to take a beat to whistle a bar of Jim Croce’s Time in a Bottle while he thinks about what he’s going to order for dinner that evening, finally decides how to meet this latest delivery and then, at the last possible moment, follows through. He is, as any number of players and coaches say, someone you only need to see hit one shot to know exactly how good he is.</p> <p>England, unfortunately for them, got to watch a lot more than one on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jun/20/england-v-india-first-mens-cricket-test-day-one-live\">first day of the opening Test</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/england-india-first-test-day-one-match-report-cricket\">India’s Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal make tons to leave England toiling in first Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In style, Gill is a throwback batter. He plays the game with patrician disdain, waiting for the ball like it’s his butler, then, sending it scurrying away with a casual flick of his wrist, to fetch him a cold drink from somewhere the other side of the covers. It’s all done with the bare minimum of apparent effort, he pulls his bat up shy when he drives, and stops halfway through his pull shot. But in substance he is the very model of a modern middle order cricketer. He had scored more centuries in T20 cricket than he had in Test matches, and still has a higher top score in the shorter format. Just.</p> <p>He was in many ways, still unfulfilled as a Test match batter when India decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/19/hail-the-prince-shubman-gill-india-captaincy-england-headingley-cricket-test\">make him their new captain</a>. He had scored five centuries, but they were all made in the subcontinent (four in India, one in Bangladesh) and his top-score elsewhere was a 91 he made in Brisbane four years ago. Coming into this Test, it was the only score of more than 50 he had made across tours of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, England and the West Indies. His nickname, Prince, suits him for lots of reasons, not least that it felt like his defining achievements are all ahead of him. The hundred he made here was the first of them.</p>    <p>Gill is the youngest man to captain India since Sachin Tendulkar got the job in 1996. If he carries on in the way he played on the first day at Headingley, he will, unlike Tendulkar, have it for a long while yet. It helped that England made the hardest decision of the day for him. Judging a toss before the end of the match is like counting a chicken before it’s hatched, or damning a pitch before both teams have had a bat. Generally it pays to wait before you make your mind up. But after just half an hour, it was hard to avoid the creeping feeling that England had got it wrong here.</p> <p>Gill said he would have done the same thing in Ben Stokes’s position. It turned out to be good for him that he didn’t get the opportunity. England may yet be vindicated, there have been a lot of good fourth-innings scores at Headingley in recent years, and the last six Tests here have all been won by the team bowling first, but the first day’s play was hot work for bowlers and the wickets were hard-earned. By midway through the morning session, Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse had both had a go from either end, Josh Tongue tried both sides of the wicket. It already felt as if Stokes had turned out his pockets searching for England’s first wicket.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/england-india-cricket-fans-swelter-test-cricket-headingley-jaiswal\">Fries with everything: fans swelter on Headingley’s Test return as Jaiswal tucks in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was one of those mornings when the bowling team first measures success in edges and almosts, clapping the balls that whizz past slips, or fizz over the gully, then, when the batters are starting to middle it, celebrating the shots you insist you want the batter to be playing, like the drives that might have been sliced behind if they hadn’t disappeared through cover for four. England eventually got one, then two, wickets, in the run-up to lunch. So it fell to Gill, batting at No 4, to reassert control of the innings. He was waiting for England when they came back on to the field, having spent most of the break patting back throwdowns from a couple of the squad players.</p> <p>He carried on that way through the rest of the day, Carse, who goes about his bowling like the batter is a stray nail that needs to be hammered back into the crease, troubled him some. But the rest of England’s attack hardly mustered a chance worth appealing for between them. So Gill moved imperiously to his hundred, as unruffled, and regal, as Cleopatra along the Nile, the only blemishes in his innings were the one bungled single on 97, and the pair of black socks peeping out from beneath the hems of his white trousers.</p>",

She has previously <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-visit-israel-gaza-hamas-conflict-bias/\">faced criticism for not speaking up</a> over the humanitarian consequences for Palestinians from Israel’s onslaught.</p> <p>The EU-Israel association agreement, signed in 1995, underpins a trade relationship worth €68bn (£58bn) between 27 European countries and the Middle Eastern country. The EU is Israel’s largest market and accounts for about one-third of its trade. Israel is also a member of the EU’s Horizon research funding programme, and has secured grants worth €831m since the current programme began in 2021.</p> <p>The document emerged after more than 100 campaign groups urged the commission this week to suspend the association agreement. </p> <p>“A weak or inconclusive review of Israel’s compliance with article 2, and/or failure by the commission and council to suspend at least part of the association agreement, would ultimately destroy what’s left of the EU’s credibility [and] further embolden Israel authorities to continue their atrocity crimes,” reads the statement, signed by 113 civil society groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Eve Geddie, the head of Amnesty International’s EU office, said the decision to launch a review had come “tragically, devastatingly late” and that while it was important, as time passed Israeli forces had become “more and more emboldened”.</p> <p>Separately, eight EU member states have written to Kallas urging her to look into discontinuing trade of goods and services from the occupied Palestinian territories. </p> <p>The letter, organised by Belgium, states the EU is obliged to respond to an opinion from the international court of justice last July <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/israels-settlement-policies-break-international-law-court-finds\">ordering Israel to end its occupation </a>of Palestinian territories as soon as possible. In a landmark – albeit non-binding – ruling, the court said other states were under an obligation not to recognise the occupation as lawful.</p> <p>“We have not seen a proposal on how to effectively discontinue trade of goods and services with the illegal settlements,” states the letter, calling for the EU to set out a timeline for reaching “full compliance” with the advisory opinion around its first anniversary.</p>    <p>EU policy on Israel has been hobbled by difficulties finding unanimity among 27 member states with starkly different views, from countries that have recognised Palestine,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/22/significant-spain-norway-ireland-recognition-state-palestine\"> including Spain and Ireland</a>, to staunch allies of the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>The tide turned last month when the Netherlands, a strong ally of Israel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/netherlands-urges-review-of-eu-israel-trade-deal-over-catastrophic-gaza-aid-block\">launched a call </a>to review the EU-Israel association agreement, after <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/19/tens-of-thousands-protest-in-the-hague-to-demand-dutch-government-action-on-gaza-war\">the largest protests on Dutch streets</a> over a foreign policy question in decades. </p> <p>The Dutch foreign minister, Casper Veldkamp, a former ambassador to Israel, argued that Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip was a breach of international law and therefore the association agreement. An unexpectedly large number of countries agreed, although the question was not put to a vote.</p> <p>The EU is far from united over what to do next. A full suspension of the agreement, which requires unanimity, is seen as impossible, given the certainty of a veto from Hungary, the Czech Republic or Germany. </p> <p>The EU only needs a weighted majority to suspend favourable trade terms or Israel’s participation in Horizon, but even those outcomes are highly uncertain.</p> <p>Hildegard Bentele, a German centre-right MEP who chairs the European parliament’s Israel delegation, criticised moves to question the agreement. “This will not have any influence on the Israeli government. I am very sure about it. This will put us in a less influential position,” she said in an interview earlier this month.</p> <p>Kallas’s predecessor, Josep Borrell, however, has criticised Europe for shirking its moral responsibilities over Gaza. In a typically outspoken speech, he argued the EU should use the association agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/09/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-says-eus-former-top-diplomat\">as a lever to demand</a> that humanitarian law is respected.</p> <p>In a further illustration of the EU’s foreign policy knots, Hungary is blocking EU sanctions against violent Israeli settlers.</p> <p>Kallas earlier this week voiced frustration at critics that have accused the EU of silence and inaction, citing the need to find consensus. “Sanctions need unanimity. And again I’m representing 27 [countries].” </p> <p>She argued that presenting sanctions that would inevitably fail was pointless: “I feel better myself that I’ve done something, but actually I know that this will not go through … and then it will just show that we don’t have a common position.”</p>",

Finally it’s done and I was waiting for a long time,” Wirtz said on Liverpool’s website. “I’m really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League.</p> \n<p>“I will see how I can perform. I hope I can do my best. I spoke also with some players who played [at Liverpool] and they told me that it’s perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game.

How fabulous, exciting and yes, maddening they really were.</p> <p>Don’t worry about the future; Australia. The Ashes. The Urn. Or, <em>do</em> worry about Pat Cummins bowling one of those impossibly jagging bail trimmers to Joe Root in December but know that worrying is as effective as trying to learn Mandarin by downing Guinness.

Harry Brook will look a million dollars but find a way to get out in the most inexplicably ugly fashion. Stokes will try and bowl eight on the bounce when his dander is up, don’t let him do this. Jamie Smith will launch one out of the ground. Brendon McCullum will sit on a balcony with shades on and trotters up. Inscrutable. Beard tapered as if he’s leading a Cinch sponsored Armada.

Maybe you’ll be glued to every ball or maybe you’ll dip in and out as life intervenes.

The first two – <strong>Reaching High </strong>on Tuesday and <strong>Rainbows Edge </strong>a day later – both set off as favourites and never really threatened to oblige for their backers, but <strong>Purple Rainbow, </strong>with the very capable apprentice Warren Fentiman taking off 5lb, is going to set off at more of a working person’s price and is currently on offer at 20-1. She started the season with an entry in the Oaks, and there was a smidge of encouragement in her run into fourth at this track in late April but the placed horses have done little to advertise the form and it is hard to argue that the handicapper has been unduly patriotic in handing her an opening mark of 84. More plausible winners include <strong>Silver Ghost </strong>and <strong>Miss Nightfall, </strong>first and second respectively in a strongly-run race at Goodwood in May, and Miss Nightfall, with Oisin Murphy booked to ride, has been a huge springer in the market this morning from double-figure odds down to clear 3-1 favourite. Silver Ghost is 6lb<strong> </strong>worse off at the weights today but she won with something in hand at Goodwood and, like Miss Nightfall, is drawn towards the favoured stands’ side, so 8-1 looks a fair price for her to confirm the form. <strong>Dash Of Azure, </strong>in the blue and white colours of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion chairman Tony Bloom, is also attracting support and is up just 5lb in the weights after a comfy success on the all-weather at Kempton in May, while Andrew Balding’s <strong>Zgharta, </strong>making her handicap debut with Hollie Doyle holding the reins, is another with a live chance from the 20-something stalls.</p> <p><strong>SELECTION:</strong> SILVER GHOST.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-685541e08f0840982823b4c9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T11:15:23.977Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ROYAL ASCOT 4.20, CORONATION STAKES, GROUP ONE, 3YO FILLIES, 1M preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A race which lost its likely favourite just over a week ago when <strong>Lake Victoria, </strong>the emphatic winner of the Irish 1,000 Guineas, was ruled out, and with Desert Flower, the 1,000 Guineas winner at Newmarket, also missing after running a brave third in the Oaks at Epsom two weeks ago, the only major Classic winner in this year’s field is the warm favourite, <strong>Zarigana.</strong>She was awarded the Poule D’Essai Des Pouliches, France’s equivalent of the 1,000 Guineas, in the Longchamp stewards’ room after finishing a nose behind Charlie Fellowes’s <strong>Shes Perfect. </strong>That decision provoked plenty of comment – you can see what you think of it <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2NE1I9vNDqM?feature=shared\">here</a> – as well as an unsuccessful appeal from Shes Perfect’s connections. The other Guineas winners may be missing, but Ollie Sangster’s <strong>Flight </strong>was a runner in both, finishing an excellent one-length second behind Desert Flower at Newmarket before running a little below that level when sixth home at the Curragh. Aidan O’Brien has two runners in the absence of Lake Victoria, and <strong>January </strong>is presumably the pick of the pair as Ryan Moore is booked to ride. The most interesting runners against the favourite, though, are the two unbeaten fillies that were added to the field at the weekend, <strong>Falakeyah </strong>and <strong>Kon Tiki. </strong>The former was a deeply impressive winner of the 10-furlong Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket’s Guineas meeting, where she raced freely in front but still had more than enough left to win unchallenged by three-and-a-quarter lengths. Her run-style there suggests the drop back to a mile will not be an issue. <strong>Kon Tiki, </strong>meanwhile, represents the top-class but, I feel, still somewhat under-rated Jane Chapple-Hyam stable. She won a Listed event at York’s Dante meeting with a good deal more to spare than a margin of half-a-length might suggest and posted a very good time in the process. </p> <p><strong>Key form:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>1,000 Guineas, </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Irkxfd09nk0?feature=shared\">Newmarket, 4 May 25 (Flight, Simmering, Chantilly Lace, Duty First)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Irish 1,000 Guineas,</strong> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/suE_fuii3aY?feature=shared\">Curragh, 25 May 25 (Flight, January, Duty First, Simmering, Cercene)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Poule D’Essai Des Pouliches (French 1,000 Guineas), </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/2NE1I9vNDqM?feature=shared\">Longchamp, 11 May 2025 (Zarigana, Exactly)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Prix Marcel Boussac</strong>, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/91WNefsLyS4?feature=shared\">Longchamp 6 Oct 24 (Zarigana, Exactly, Simmering)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Michael Seely Memorial Fillies’ Stakes, </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/PCMTPeLIv98?si=E90a0IYoXtFxxmO8\">York 16 May 24 (Kon Tiki)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Pretty Polly Stakes, </strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/PCMTPeLIv98?si=E90a0IYoXtFxxmO8\">Newmarket, 4 May 25 (Falakeyah)</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>SELECTION: KON TIKI</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-685541a48f08c39b90a6af80\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T11:11:08.282Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ROYAL ASCOT 3.40, DUKE OF EDINBURGH STAKES HANDICAP, 1M 4F preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is the slot once occupied by the King Edward VII Stakes, which is now the sixth race on the card, and the Group Two was bounced to the early evening primarily to give World Pool punters in Hong Kong a juicy handicap just before bedtime. That says a lot about the competitiveness and unpredictability involved when 20+ runners hare around the mile-and-a-half course, but also about the importance of World Pool to Ascot in maintaining its prize money at an internationally competitive level. <strong>Hand Of God </strong>is a familiar name from last year, when he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h0l8zNOYbIs?si=yP8QocbaFORWA7l1\">won the Golden Gates Handicap</a> over 10 furlongs, and he has had only one run since – which he probably needed – when finishing ninth of 13 in a handicap at Newmarket. <strong>Ethical Diamond, </strong>fourth in this race last year and also fourth in the County Hurdle at Cheltenham in March, runs for the Willie Mullins /Ryan Moore combination, while the Qatar-based Wathnan Racing operation has two runners, <strong>Almosh’her </strong>and <strong>French Duke. </strong>James Doyle, their retained jockey, would presumably have had the pick of the pair, and while Almosh’her is currently a point shorter in the betting, I’m inclinded to side with Doyle and go with French Duke, who will be having his first start of the season here.</p> <p><strong>SELECTION:</strong> FRENCH DUKE.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68553fc08f0840982823b4b2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T11:08:35.174Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ROYAL ASCOT 3.05, COMMONWEALTH CUP, GROUP ONE, 3YO, 6F preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>By the standards of most British racecourses and festival meetings, Royal Ascot has Group One races coming out of its ears, but it would still be a little embarrassing to lose one under the Group-race system’s quality-control rules, which is a threat that was hanging over this race 12 months ago. It was awarded Group One status when it was founded in 2015, which itself caused some muttering at tracks which can only hope to upgrade their races to the highest level the old-fashioned way - via significant investment, hard graft and patience – but the average end-of-year rating for the first four home in 2021 and 2022 was a long way below the required standard of 115. But it got the decent renewal it urgently needed last year, not least thanks to the subsequent exploits of <strong>Lake Forest,</strong> the runner-up behind <strong>Inisherin</strong>, who went on to win one of the world’s richest turf events, the $10m Golden Eagle in Australia. It would further ease the fears over a possible downgrade if <strong>Shadow Of Light, </strong>last year’s Dewhurst Stakes winner over seven furlongs, could get the job done dropping back to six, and he ran as though he could well be most effective at sprint trips when fading late into third in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket. <strong>Babouche, </strong>last season’s Group One Phoenix Stakes winner at the Curragh, and <strong>Whistlejacket, </strong>second in the Phoenix and then the winner of the Prix Morny at Deauville, are two more high-achieving juveniles in the field, and also finished first and second respectively in a Group Three at Naas in mid-May. Among the less-exposed potential improvers, <strong>Jonquil, </strong>has serious claims on his close second to Henri Matisse in the French 2,000 Guineas, although the winner did not do much for the form in Tuesday’s St James’s Palace Stakes. William Haggas’s filly <strong>Sky Majesty, </strong>in the same colours as Lake Forest 12 months ago, was unbeaten in three starts as a juvenile including a Group Two on heavy ground at Chantilly in October, and while she was a beaten favourite on her three-year-old debut on the all-weather at Chelmsford in April, her super-shrewd trainer is hardly renowned for running horses out of their depth. And there was also a lot to like about the way <strong>Shisospicy</strong> went about her business in the Mamzelle Stakes at Churchill Downs in early May. Oisin Murphy is booked to ride for Jose D’Angelo and the daughter of Mitole, a cracking dirt sprinter in his time, has been attracting support this morning.</p> <p><strong>KEY FORM:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>2,000 Guineas, </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nwvKAfocgQ\">Newmarket 3 May 25 (Shadow Of Light)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Phoenix Stakes, </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOrGBEvAaTI\">the Curragh, 10 Aug 24 (Babouche, Whistlejacket)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Prix Morny, </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6thZXOzQl4w\">Deauville, 18 Aug 24 (Whistlejacket)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Poule D’Essai Des Poulains (French 2,000 Guineas), </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9fnT3ZtFXI\">Longchamp 11 May 25 (Jonquil).</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Dewhurst Stakes, </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxPP9r1LWLE\">Newmarket 12 Oct 24 (Shadow Of Light)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Lacken Stakes, </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMuYH39oIQY\">Naas, 18 May 25 (Babouche, Whistlejacket)</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Mamzelle Stakes,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=898aeYMeb74\">Churchill Downs, 10 May 25 (Shisospicy)</a></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>SELECTION:</strong> SHADOW OF LIGHT. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T11:09:07.742Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-68553f4b8f0808294ac4a4dd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T11:01:23.817Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ROYAL ASCOT 2.30, ALBANY STAKES, 2YO FILLIES, 6F preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The two-year-old fillies’ equivalent of Tuesday’s Coventry Stakes for colts has a fine recent record when it comes to identifying the stars of the future, with both Meditate (trained by Aidan O’Brien) and Porta Fortuna (saddled by his son, Donnacha) going on to win Group One races later in their careers. And all three of the racehorse-training O’Briens have live runners in this year’s race, as <strong>Green Sense, </strong>who is stabled with Donnacha’s older brother, Joseph, tops the <em>Timeform </em>ratings, with Aidan O’Brien’s <strong>Signora </strong>not far behind. Green Sense and Signora finished second and third respectively in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eyhZ3gYTFkk?si=hGRfivp408iT0V6o\">Group Three Blackbear Fillies’ Sprint Stakes</a> at Naas in May, when Joseph’s runner was having a second outing and his dad’s filly was making her racecourse debut. The market definitely expects Signora to make significant progress today and she is currently trading at around 9-4, with Hugo Palmer’s <strong>Fitzella </strong>next in at 5-1. She beat the re-opposing <strong>Tahalel </strong>by three-and-a-half lengths at Haydock last month, and is a big chance for Oisin Murphy to move within one win of Ryan Moore in the race for the jockeys’ title this week. <strong>Ipanema Queen </strong>and <strong>Gold Digger </strong>also have a single win against their name, and Richard Spencer’s runner, a 260k gns (£273k) purchase at the Newmarket breeze-up sale in April, showed a useful turn of foot to win his first start at Yarmouth and could well outrun his odds of around 9-1.</p> <p> <strong>SELECTION: </strong>GOLD DIGGER.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-68553bb88f08c39b90a6af1f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T10:47:13.559Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thursday was a big day – another big day</strong> – for Ryan Moore.

two unbeaten up-and-comers were added to the race at the weekend and will give her plenty to think about.</p> <p>The top-rated two-year-old of 2024, <strong>Shadow Of Light,</strong> is up against 20 opponents in the day’s first Group One, the Commonwealth Cup at 3.05, while in the King Edward VII Stakes later on the card “Ascot Derby”, Ralph Beckett’s <strong>Amiloc </strong>will attempt to extend his unbeaten record to five races against another very promising colt, Johnny Murtagh’s <strong>Zahrann.</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Both the straight and round courses were watered overnight – 6mm on the straight course and 5mm on the round – and the going remains good-to-firm all over, but it will be drying all the time with temperatures heading into the upper 20s again today and <strong>Leovanni, </strong>in the Commonwealth Cup, is one of four scratches so far on today’s card due to the ground.</p> <p> The action is underway at the immutable time of 2.30 with the Albany Stakes, a juvenile contest that has been won by several future Group One winners in the recent past, and as ever, you can follow all the news and action as it happens, from the publication of the carriage list right through to the last horse across the line in the concluding sprint handicap, here on the Guardian’s live blog.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T11:00:14.055Z\">at 12.00pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

            "body" : "<p>Jack Draper is a perfectionist in every sense of the word, which means that for the third consecutive match he departed the court quite unimpressed by the level of tennis he demonstrated. There were, after all, quite a few self-sabotaging concentration lapses, his forehand was sometimes too erratic and he did not always seem comfortable moving on the slick grass.</p> <p>In the most important moments, however, when the match hung in the balance, the 23-year-old locked in and produced his best tennis. Once again, the British No 1 held his nerve in the final stages of a tough three-setter as he defeated Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals at Queen’s Club for the first time in his career.</p> <p>The victory means Draper will return to his career-high ranking of No 4 on Monday, securing him a top-four seeding at Wimbledon. At a time when almost every player wishes to avoid an early meeting with Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, he cannot face either of the world’s top two before the semi-finals.</p> <p>However, a meeting with Alcaraz here remains on the cards. One day after his own dramatic three-set win, as he recovered from 2-4 in the final set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/19/carlos-alcaraz-beats-the-heat-in-epic-comeback-over-munar-at-queens-club\">to defeat Jaume Munar</a> in a three hour, 26-minute marathon, Alcaraz, the top seed, returned to the semi-finals at Queen’s Club with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Arthur Rinderknech. Alcaraz has won 16 consecutive matches, the longest winning streak of his career.</p> <p>Alcaraz stressed how difficult it was to recover with less than 24 hours after such a tough match. “Could be better, honestly, but I thought I was going to feel much worse than I feel right now,” the world No 2 said. “But we are tennis players, we have to do whatever we have to do just to recover, to be in good shape the next day. I’m just feeling great. I’m glad that today was one hour, 20 minutes. Today was more grass [than clay], so I’m just happy and hopefully tomorrow I’m going to feel much better.”</p>    <p>For Draper the past few days have, in some ways, emphasised just how much things have changed over the past year. Although he has broken new ground this week by reaching a first semi-final at this venue, he still feels some way from producing his best. “The level of what I’m playing could be more consistent, definitely better,” he said. “I think it will come. The more I practise, the more I play, I’m getting a little bit better each time. I don’t know when it will come together, but still doing well to be in the semis. Day by day, we’ll see.</p> <p>While he has previously been able to produce his best level from the beginning of the grass season, Draper is still finding his feet after enduring his first full clay-court season and the significant efforts it took for him to adapt his game to suit a completely different surface.</p> <p>“It’s just such a hard adjustment,” said Draper. “I really tried on the clay to play a certain way, to be aggressive in the back court, to be tough from the back of the court, and I spent probably like a month and a half on the clay.</p> <p>This is still [early] because I didn’t practise too much before the tournament with certain things. I’m sort of going by ear out there a little bit, and I’m trying to become more and more comfortable on the grass. When you get more comfortable in the movement, more comfortable in what you’re trying to do out there, it just starts clicking.”</p> <p>During the decisive moments, though, the confidence that Draper has gained over the past few years has been plain for all to see and every match affords him the opportunity to further improve his level on grass as he attempts to peak in time for Wimbledon. Draper will next face the talented Czech Jiri Lehecka, who ended the excellent run of the British No 2, Jacob Fearnley, with a 7-5, 6-2 win.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, released his first music single, <em>Polvere e Gloria</em> (Dust and Glory), with the famous Italian vocalist Andrea Bocelli. Alongside Bocelli’s singing, Sinner reiterates parts of his past speeches during trophy ceremonies. On Thursday, the same day the song was announced, Sinner suffered his first defeat to a player ranked outside the top 20 in nearly two years, losing in three sets to Alexander Bublik in the second round of the Halle Open.</p>    <p>In Nottingham Katie Boulter’s bid for a hat-trick of titles came to an end as she was beaten 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 by McCartney Kessler. The British No 2 and eighth seed secured a service break early in the deciding set but the American stormed back to reach the semi-finals.</p>",

But what does it mean for the future? </p> \n<h2>When could the first assisted death happen?</h2> \n<p>It may be some years away yet – although no later than 2029. There is no timetable but, under the terms of the legislation, it needs to start within four years after the law is passed. </p> \n<p>The bill is likely to be given royal assent by the end of the year, if it passes smoothly through the House of Lords. However, there are many details about the process that are yet to be ironed out, including how the system will work either within the NHS or outside it, that could delay its implementation.</p> \n<h2>What about people who are sick now?</h2> \n<p>Many people with terminal illnesses campaigning for a change in the law will be relieved by the legislation but are not certain to benefit from it themselves. It could take years to implement, so those with a shorter life expectancy are unlikely to be eligible for an assisted dying service.</p> \n<h2>Will doctors need to be trained?</h2> \n<p>The training and qualifications of doctors is one of the points yet to be resolved, although it has been decided that medical staff will not be compelled to take part in assisted dying services. </p> \n<p>Other subjects that need to be discussed include the type of lethal substance to be administered, the forms of identification patients would have to provide, the records that would have to be kept by doctors and the codes of practice around the assisted dying process – as well as the location and type of services.</p> \n<h2>How could it be done?</h2> \n<p>There are many logistics to thrash out, with health minister Stephen Kinnock and justice minister Sarah Sackman in charge of implementation. One possibility is integrating a service into the NHS, which would oversee the process of moving from palliative care to assisted dying for those with less than six months to live. </p> \n<p>An alternative would be to have a separate unit outside the NHS available through third parties, similar to the situation in Switzerland. A hybrid model could look like the way in which abortions are carried out by separate providers such as the not-for-profit British Pregnancy Advisory Service and others, but ultimately overseen by the NHS. </p> \n<p>The bill makes provision for the service to be carried out for free, but if it is publicly funded then it would get money that is currently not wholly provided to end-of-life services such as hospices, which tend to raise money as charities.</p> \n<h2>Can the Lords block it?</h2> \n<p>The idea was not in the Labour government’s manifesto, so convention dictates that it could be killed off in the second chamber. It could also be so mired in difficulty and delay in the Lords that it ran out of time.</p> \n<p>However, given it has been voted through in the House of Commons, it is highly likely to pass at some point, as most bills do – probably before the end of the year. </p> \n<p>If it were to run out of time in this parliamentary session, then it would not be carried over to the next because it is a private member’s bill. </p> \n<p>Another MP would have to put it forward and start all over again, unless the government decided to take up the cause and propose its own legislation.</p> \n<h2>Will it be significantly changed via amendments?</h2> \n<p>Undoubtedly, some peers will attempt to change the legislation, and many MPs acknowledge there is still room for improvement. There are some outright opponents of the legislation as well, such as Tanni Grey-Thompson, a disabled peer and Paralympic medallist. </p> \n<p>But the most likely outcome is that peers will refine the legislation before it is sent back to the House of Commons and then ultimately passed. Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill as a backbencher, said recently that she thinks the House of Lords will end up voting in favour.</p> \n<h2>What about Scotland and Northern Ireland?</h2> \n<p>The bill applies to England and Wales, with the Welsh parliament denied a veto over the legislation. Scotland is currently going through the process of examining its own legislation. There are no plans for assisted dying to be introduced in Northern Ireland at the moment.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>India slightly snuck into the country four weeks ago, dribs and drabs getting an A tour under way before the bulk of the first-teamers landed and began playing intra-squad cricket. The delayed finish to the Indian ­Premier League commanded eyeballs, then the World Test Champion­ship final last week. All told, it was a soft launch.</p> <p>But on day one of this summer’s marquee series, the tourists announced their arrival with a flex of the muscles and an eruption of runs. Sublime centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) and ­Shubman Gill (127 not out) had driven England potty and taken India to 359 for three at stumps. Gill’s first outing as captain was an unqualified success – not least because the absence of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma barely got a mention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/englands-stokes-criticised-for-staggering-decision-to-put-india-into-bat\">England’s Stokes criticised for ‘staggering’ decision to put India into bat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A chastening start for Ben Stokes and his side after winning the toss, clearly, albeit not unfamiliar territory as regards their initial tormentor. Jaiswal racked up 712 runs against them in India last year and his image was practically burned on to their collective retinas at the end of a 4-1 thumping. Might the left-hander’s first Test match encounter with the Dukes ball see a change of fortune? The answer, it swiftly transpired, was no.</p> <p>But then Jaiswal is a player who likes to make a good first impression, having made a century on debut in the Caribbean, one in his first Test in Australia, and now one on arrival in England. It was some knock, too – the first by an Asian opener at Headingley, no less – as the 23-year-old left diligently, cut ferociously and drove with panache.</p> <p>Indeed, until Stokes castled him after tea with an inswinger that nipped away, Jaiswal’s chief concern was cramp in his forearms as he cruised into the 90s. Even then, despite a couple of delays with the physio and some obvious pain, he moved to 99 with a flurry of fours off Brydon Carse before a pinched single sealed Test century No&nbsp;5.</p>    <p>While Jaiswal moved up through the gears – 96 balls for his half-century, just 48 more to double it – Gill started fast and then bedded in. At 5.44pm, as he caressed Josh Tongue through the covers for four, he became the first Indian since Kohli 11 years ago to make a century in his first innings as captain. Gill’s celebration, a punch of the air and an almighty roar, was in stark contrast to the serenity that got him there.</p> <p>At the other end was his vice-captain, Rishabh Pant, who finished unbeaten on 65 in a stand worth 138 runs. This new-found responsibility had dampened none of the mischief either, Pant dancing down to Stokes second ball and clobbering him back over his head for four. In the final over, when thoughts might have turned to safety, Pant summed up the day as a whole by swatting Chris Woakes for six with a swivel pull.</p> <p>This being Headingley, so often a scene of the absurd and a ground where the last six Tests have been won by the side who bowled first, England will refuse to believe they are snookered. By the same token, inviting a team to bat first under clear skies and then having them ­dominate all three sessions was clearly suboptimal. The air was soupy, the outfield fast, and England failed to locate the Headingley length.</p> <p>Both captains wanted to bowl first, however, and the modern way – certainly the Stokes and Brendon McCullum way – is not always to do so with an eye on rolling a side cheaply. Against New Zealand at Trent Bridge three years ago, Stokes inserted, watched the tourists notch up 553, and England won by five wickets. India scored 418 at Edgbaston that same summer after being asked to bat first and lost by seven wickets.</p>    <p>Of greater concern was the fact that Stokes was the best of the quicks on show, not simply figures of two for 43 from 13 overs that showed his renewed hardiness but by way of obvious threat. Carse flickered on his home debut – his removal of KL&nbsp;Rahul before lunch came via a lazy waft – but Josh Tongue was scattergun. Woakes, tasked with leading the attack, found precious little ­movement and was ransacked.</p> <p>If there was one relative success among the frontliners it was probably Shoaib Bashir sending down 21 overs and, with a bit of drift but no turn, holding his own in the main. An economy of 3.1 sitting under the overall run-rate of 4.2 meant the off-spinner had performed the day-one holding role that many thought was beyond him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/20/england-india-cricket-fans-swelter-test-cricket-headingley-jaiswal\">Fries with everything: fans swelter on Headingley’s Test return as Jaiswal tucks in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this was India’s day, the day their deep talent pool scotched the notion that two big-name retirements would leave two gaping holes. Things had looked ominous for England from pretty much the outset, too, India dominating the early exchanges and getting to within touching distance of lunch when Rahul’s error on 42 opened up an end.</p> <p>The instant removal of Sai Sudharsan, strangled down leg off Stokes for a four-ball duck on debut, might have appeared a touch unfortunate as India walked off at 92 for two but there was clearly a plan behind it. Problem was, this was the only one that worked as Stokes ran through his usual playbook and Jaiswal and Gill were equal to all of it.</p> <p>There were two chances to break their stand of 129 runs early. Jaiswal would have been lbw 43 when pinned by a yorker from Carse, only for a front-foot no-ball to stifle any appeal. And had Ollie Pope hit the stumps with a shy from midwicket, Gill would have been run out for just one. Both came, both went, and India have unquestionably arrived.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A lifetime of hope and endeavour enjoyed a glorious reward here on Friday as Joseph Murphy, who is two years short of a half-century with a trainer’s licence, finally added a Group One winner to his record as Cercene, at 33-1, edged out the 6-4 favourite, Zarigana, in the Coronation Stakes, the feature event on day four at Royal Ascot.</p> \n<p>“It’s 50 years of work by the family,” Murphy said afterwards. “Going from a small yard, switching from National Hunt to the Flat and always believing, buying horses and believing that they’re going to be good. It’s a lifetime’s ambition to have a Group One winner.”</p> \n<p>Cercene had to dig deep for the win, as Zarigana headed her at the furlong pole but then failed to put the race to bed. Cercene, though, did her trainer proud, pulling out more all the way to the line to get home by half a length. Francis-Henri Graffard, Zarigana’s trainer, suggested afterwards that he might “need to buy a pair of blinkers”, but the will to win that Cercene showed when it mattered is a vital part of a true Group One winner’s makeup.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jun/20/royal-ascot-2025-updates-previews-and-more-from-day-four-live\">Royal Ascot 2025: Cercene claims major Coronation Stakes shock on day four – live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cercene went off at a big price, but she had finished a four-length third behind Lake Victoria – a warm ante-post favourite for this race until injury intervened – in the Irish 1,000 Guineas in late May. She settled well in fourth for Gary Carroll, her jockey, as Falakeyah, the second-favourite, cut out the running, and as Falakeyah faded in the straight, Carroll was perfectly positioned both to strike for home and then take advantage as Zarigana’s momentum faltered.</p> \n<p>“Decent horses are very hard to come by and I’ve been lucky enough to find one with a huge heart,” Carroll said. “If I was ever to ride a Group One winner, I’m delighted it was for Joe Murphy. He’s been supporting me since I was a 7lb claimer, a long, long time.</p> \n<p>“The French horse [Zarigana] came and she actually got headed, but she’s very tough, she stuck her head out and really went to the line for me.”</p> \n<p>It was very much a day for smaller family operations as earlier in the afternoon, Harry Eustace’s Time For Sandals, another outsider at 25-1, had taken the Group One Commonwealth Cup, and since Eustace also won the Queen Anne Stakes on Tuesday, the yard now has two more Group Ones at this year’s meeting than Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle.</p> \n<p>“The most concerning part was her draw [in stall one],” Eustace said. “When Karl Burke’s filly [Venetian Sun in the opening Albany Stakes] came out of one, everyone just stuck there [and] we had plenty of pace.</p> \n<p>“It’s the first time she’s had a fast horse to follow. We were … I don’t want to say very confident, but we just felt we hadn’t seen the best from her for one reason or another. We were always confident in a race like this, where there would be fast horses taking her along, that’s really what she needed.”</p> \n<p>James Eustace, Harry’s father, trained at the family’s Park Lodge Stables for 30 years before passing on the licence in 2020, and his other son, David, has enjoyed a successful training career in Australia and Hong Kong, highlighted by a Melbourne Cup success with Gold Trip in 2022.</p> \n<p>“If we did anything, we instilled a work ethic in them,” Eustace said, “hopefully by example rather than by a long tom, but we were so lucky from day one that they loved the whole thing.</p> \n<p>“We tried to make Harry go to university, he went to Edinburgh for two years, enjoyed himself immensely and then dropped out and went to Australia to work in racing, and hasn’t looked back.”</p> \n<p>Venetian Sun will be aimed towards next year’s 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket after her decisive win in the opening Albany Stakes.</p> \n<p>“I think she’s a very special filly,” Karl Burke, Venetian Sun’s trainer, said. “The work she’s done at home, I haven’t had a two-year-old filly work like that. Just the last couple of months, six weeks, she’s kicking all the Group horses out of the way at home.”</p> \n<p>Venetian Sun was backed from 12-1 to 7-1 before her win – “given the confidence Karl gave us, we had to have a decent bet,” Tony Bloom, Venetian Sun’s co-owner, said afterwards – and is a 25-1 shot for the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May 2026.</p> \n<p>The fourth day concluded with Aidan O’Brien and the John &amp; Thady Gosden stables tied on five winners each ahead of tomorrow’s seven-race card. The race for the jockeys’ award is also just about in play, as Oisin Murphy’s win on Adrestia in the last was his fourth of the meeting, two behind Ryan Moore’s tally of six.</p> \n<h2>Satono Reve can deliver overdue win for Japan</h2> \n<p>A dozen runners from Japan have tried and failed to become the country’s first winner at Royal Ascot since the turn of the century, but the 13th could finally make the breakthrough on the final day of this year’s Royal meeting, when Satono Reve will go to post with a leading chance in the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes.</p> \n<p>Noriyuki Hori’s six-year-old is a Grade One winner in Japan and also finished within a length of Ka Ying Rising, the world’s top-rated sprinter, in a Group One at Sha Tin in December.</p> \n<p>He was two-and-a-quarter lengths behind Ka Ying Rising at the same track in April before heading to the UK, and has been given plenty of time to acclimatise after arriving in Newmarket on 2 May.</p> \n<p><strong>Satono Reve (3.40)</strong> is up against a deep and international field, with fancied runners from France and Ireland as well as a strong local defence led by last year’s Commonwealth Cup winner, Inisherin.</p> \n<p>At his best, though, he is the equal of any of Saturday’s runners and it is also a positive sign that João “Magic Man” Moreira, who was in the saddle for his big run in December, has flown in to take the ride.</p> \n<p><strong>Royal Ascot 2.30:</strong> Aidan O’Brien is going for a sixth win in nine years with Moments Of Joy but she may struggle against the €2m Frankel colt <strong>Treanmor</strong>, who was sent off at 1-3 for his debut in May and powered four lengths clear with minimal encouragement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"22bc0476-8c39-4d72-99ec-38ce5a855671\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Redcar </b>1.10 Try Storm Cat 1.43 Jungle Monarch 2.14&nbsp;Paco’s Pride 2.49 Tiva 3.21 Azure Angel 4.05&nbsp;Lima Sierra 4.45 Park Street&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newmarket </b>2.03 Crowd Quake 2.38 Commander’s Intent 3.10 Elarak 3.45 Circe 4.25 Red Flyer 5.05&nbsp;Diamont Katie&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Royal Ascot </b>2.30 Treanmor 3.05 Rebel’s Romance 3.40 Satono Reve (nb) 4.20 Remmooz 5.00&nbsp;Purosangue (nap) 5.35 Ernst Blofeld 6.10 Sober&nbsp;</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p><b>Bangor-on-Dee </b>3.55 Barranco 4.35&nbsp;Obsessedwithyou 5.15 Leading Force 5.50&nbsp;Solent Gateway 6.25 Bellbird 7.00 Chillhi 7.30&nbsp;Lord Cauvelliere&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ayr </b>4.10 Mo Of Cairo 4.50 Lion’s House 5.25 Oneforthegutter 5.55 Enchanting 6.33 Superior Council 7.08 Pinjarra 7.38 Coeur Jaune 8.08 Woohoo</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield </b>5.45 Laser Focus 6.20 Skimming Along 6.53&nbsp;Lovethiswayagain 7.23 Latynina 7.55 Blue Collar Lad 8.25 Banksman 8.55 Beelzebub&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Haydock </b>6.00 Burj Jabeel 6.40 Sugar Hill Babe 7.15&nbsp;Gold Dawn 7.45 Duke’s Command 8.15 Arkhalia Flynn 8.45 Pomme Pomme&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Royal Ascot 3.05:</strong> <strong>Rebel’s Romance </strong>had enough class to win last month’s Yorkshire Cup without being ideally suited by the step up in trip, and the return to 12 furlongs here will play to his many strengths.</p> \n<p><strong>Royal Ascot 4.20: </strong>The progressive <strong>Remmooz</strong> has shown enough in two wins this season to suggest he can improve past more exposed opponents.</p> \n<p><strong>Royal Ascot 5.00:</strong> Oisin Murphy’s mount <strong>Purosangue</strong> was less than two lengths behind likely favourite More Thunder at Newmarket last time without being given a hard time, is 8lb better off today and has been drawn well in 22.</p> \n<p><strong>Royal Ascot 5.35:</strong> <strong>Ernst Blofeld</strong> does not have much to find to take a hand in the finish on the basis of his handicap debut at Newbury and cheekpieces could eke out the necessary improvement.</p> \n<p><strong>Royal Ascot 6.10:</strong> Willie Mullins’s <strong>Sober</strong> was a dual Group Two winner for André Fabre in 2023 and has several pounds in hand of his rivals.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The 1969 caper The Italian Job spawned a Hollywood remake, helped drive the cool-factor of the Mini and launched decades of dad jokes about bloody doors being blown off. It may also have inspired one driver who got stuck trying to travel down the Spanish Steps in Rome this week.</p> <p>The film ended with Michael Caine teetering on the edge of a cliff in a coach, claiming to have a “great idea”. In Rome, the 80-year-old’s navigational error on his way to work ended with emergency services having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/man-80-gets-struck-trying-drive-down-the-spanish-steps-in-rome\">bring in a crane</a> to winch his vehicle off the Italian capital’s landmark.</p> <p>But it is not only in Rome where steps, or indeed navigational issues, can create havoc for drivers. In the slightly less celebrated surrounds of north London’s Maitland Park estate, residents have been complaining about drivers getting their cars stuck trying to rehash one of the film’s most famous scenes by driving down a small flight of steps.</p> <p>According to the Camden New Journal, <a href=\"https://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/article/cars-keep-getting-stuck-on-steps-as-drivers-take-short-cut-through-council-estate\">five cars met their match</a> on the five concrete steps within the space of a month last year, with some of the drivers reportedly blaming their satnav apps for leading them there.</p>    <p>One resident, Aron Kennedy, posted online about the phenomenon, which he referred to as a “new Camden tourist attraction along with Karl Marx”. He told the paper: “If it happens one more time I think we might have to get a living statue of a car stuck there permanently.”</p> <p>In Plymouth in 2017, it was reported that a driver turned off a road, through the gap in railings at a pedestrian crossing, across the pavement and through a covered walkway leading under a block of flats and a small supermarket, before parking the silver Vauxhall Corsa facing downwards on a flight of steps. All because the satnav had reportedly said to turn left at Tesco.</p> <p>And so many lorries have got stuck following their satnavs down a narrow country lane in Cornwall that one man reportedly paid £150 for a large yellow sign that read, in block capitals: “Do not follow satnav. This route is unsuitable. You will get stuck.” According to a local newspaper report last month, this was not enough to stop it happening yet again.</p> <p>In Somerset, by a 6ft-wide lane, stands a house that has reportedly sustained £50,000 of damage over several years from HGV drivers trying to force their way past while following directions on their devices.</p> <p>And those are just domestic tales of driving woe. Driving when abroad can be particularly confusing. Guardian readers have been sharing some of their own experiences. </p> <p>Otieno Okatch said he and his wife, from California, rented a car in Switzerland during the annual Fasnacht celebrations. “One day, we ended up in downtown Lucerne and got lost. The streets were oddly empty. We turned the corner and had inadvertently entered the city Fasnacht parade. We were mortified. A police escort had to help us get out as thousands stared at the two foreigners.”</p> <p>Anand Ranganathan, also from California, told of an experience when he and his wife were in Arles, France, while touring the country about 14 years ago. Forced by hefty mobile roaming charges to follow printed-out Google Maps directions to their hotel, they were sent down a “one-lane road that had a retractable bollard in the middle of it”.</p> <p>He said: “Only drivers who had a special code were allowed to go through it … Of course, we didn’t realise this until we got close to the bollard. Now we were stuck. There was a line of cars behind us and a bollard in front of us … The cars behind us were honking, the driver immediately behind us was cursing us in well-considered French, and I was standing there gesticulating to indicate that I was but a lost tourist.”</p> <p>To stairs in London and Devon, and narrow lanes in Cornwall and Bouches-du-Rhône, add for one driver a picturesque flight of steps in the heart of the Italian capital.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Europe is to make Iran a comprehensive offer to end its war with Israel that would include an Iranian move to zero uranium enrichment, restrictions on its ballistic missile programme and an end to Tehran’s funding of terrorist groups, Emmanuel Macron has said.</p> <p>The proposals are surprisingly broad, spanning a range of complex issues beyond Iran’s disputed nuclear programme, and are likely to complicate any solution unless an interim agreement can be agreed.</p> <p>One proposal recently aired is for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment for the duration of Donald Trump’s US presidency. The concept of uranium enrichment being overseen by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/iran-proposes-partnership-with-uae-and-saudi-arabia-to-enrich-uranium\">consortium of Middle East countries</a> – including Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – remains on the table. </p> <p>Iran has insisted it cannot abandon its right to enrich uranium within its territory, but the pressure to make concessions is intense both internally and externally.</p> <p>Macron aired his ideas on Friday as European foreign ministers held talks with their Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, in Geneva. It is the first time Araghchi has met western-based diplomats in person since the launch of the surprise Israeli offensive against Iran a week ago.</p> <p>Araghchi has spoken this week by phone to the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and has told him he will not revive US-Iran talks in person until Israel ends its strikes.</p> <p>Before leaving for Geneva, Araghchi said: “In a situation where aggression … continues, the Americans want negotiations and have sent messages several times, but we have clearly said that there is no room for dialogue until the aggression and aggressor stop. We have no talks with America as a partner in this crime.”</p> <p>The talks in Switzerland are being held against the backdrop of a week of Israeli and Iranian strikes against each other. Trump, after days of threats followed by prevarication, said on Thursday he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israel-attacks-irans-arak-heavy-water-reactor-as-iran-hits-israeli-hospital\">delay for two weeks</a> any decision on whether to join Israel’s military action. But such is the US president’s unreliability, in Tehran’s view, that it sees his commitment as valueless.</p> <p>The foreign ministers from France, Germany and the UK have consulted the US closely but diplomatic sources said they were going to Geneva stressing their belief in de-escalation and the need for dialogue. </p> <p>The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, met the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in Washington on Thursday to talk about the US red lines. The UK’s envoy to the UN, Barbara Woodward, warned Iran in a statement to the UN security council: “Any further escalation – such as restricting IAEA access, diverting nuclear material or increasing the production of high enriched uranium – would intensify the threat to international peace and security posed by Iran’s nuclear programme.”</p> <p>But she also told Israel that “military action cannot put an end to Iran’s nuclear capabilities”.</p> <p>Macron, already accused by Trump of publicity-seeking this week, set out a daunting agenda. </p> <p>“It’s absolutely essential to prioritise a return to substantial negotiations, including nuclear negotiations to move towards zero [uranium] enrichment, ballistic negotiations to limit Iran’s activities and capabilities, and the financing of all terrorist groups and destabilisation of the region that Iran has been carrying out for several years,” he said.</p> <p>He warned against the use of force, adding in a reference to Iran’s uranium enrichment facility at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/us-military-assets-missile-launch-sites-iran-fordow\">Fordow</a>: “No one can seriously believe that this threat can be met with [Israel’s] current operations alone. </p> <p>“Why? Because there are some [nuclear] plants that are highly protected and because today no one knows exactly where’s the uranium enriched to 60%. So we need to regain control on [Iran’s nuclear] programme through technical expertise and negotiation.”</p> <p>In the previous five rounds of talks, the US insisted that Iran end its entire domestic uranium enrichment programme, but said it would allow Iran to retain a civil nuclear programme, including by importing enriched uranium from a multinational consortium.</p> <p>Iran claims that as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), it has an absolute legal right to enrich uranium, a position neither the European or American powers have ever endorsed.</p> <p>In the past, European negotiators have proved more adept than their US partners in finding compromises, including the temporary suspension of domestic enrichment, a principle Tehran reluctantly endorsed in 2003-4.</p> <p>In the Paris agreement in 2004, France, Germany and the UK alongside the rest of the EU avoided the issue of whether Iran had a right to enrich by saying instead it recognised that Iran’s suspension of enrichment was “a voluntary confidence-building measure and not a legal obligation”. </p> <p>The UK position is that the NPT neither grants an absolute right to enrich nor bans it.</p> <p>Ellie Geranmayeh, from the European Council on Foreign Relations, warned against Europe making excessive demands. She said: “Over 20 years of negotiation, Europe has used its diplomatic experience to find imaginative solutions and off-ramps faced by extreme positions adopted by America and Iran. </p> <p>“It would be a lost opportunity if Europe, seeing Iran weakened, threw away the chance to play that role again by setting ultimatums that are even more demanding than the position adopted by the Trump administration, and which Iran will never accept.”</p> <p>Such is the tension around the talks that one of Araghchi’s advisers, Mohammad Hossein Ranjbaran, claimed Israel had tried to assassinate the foreign minister, and that guarantees had been sought about his safe passage to Europe.</p> <p>Russia has offered to mediate talks, a proposal rejected by European leaders. </p> <p>Iran may be in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israels-attack-has-exposed-irans-lack-of-firepower-but-conflict-could-yet-turn-in-tehrans-favour\">weak position militarily</a> with its air defences down, but for as long as the US delays a decision on whether to use its unique “bunker busting” bombs to try to destroy the Fordow plant, the Israeli prime minister is in a quandary.</p> <p>Benjamin Netanyahu’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/time-for-jews-to-repay-ancient-debt-to-cyrus-the-great-liberate-iran-says-netanyahu\">hopes for regime change</a> inside Iran have also been dealt a blow since even opponents of the Iranian government, both domestic and foreign, do not support his assault. </p> <p>Narges Mohammadi, the Iranian Nobel peace prize winner, said in a message to Trump: “Not only do not join this war but seek to stop it and establish peace throughout the Middle East.”</p> <p>A large turnout for Friday prayers in Tehran suggested Israel had created an atmosphere of rare national unity in the face of an external enemy.</p> <p>That has left Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah and opponent of the regime, relatively isolated in closely associating himself with Israel. </p> <p>Some reformists are arguing internally that enrichment is a sovereign right but that if it comes at the expense of the country’s destruction, then that right should be suspended.</p>",

There were women, children and young people among the injured because the people who went to receive the aid … came from all walks of life,” Abu Nasser said.</p> <p>Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while trying either to reach aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a secretive US- and Israel-backed organisation that recently started to hand out food in the territory or, more recently,<strong> </strong>to offload the limited number of UN and commercial vehicles carrying flour and some other basics.</p> <p>Such reports are difficult to confirm independently but appear corroborated in many details by interviews conducted with witnesses by the Guardian.</p> <p>Khaled al-Ajouri, 33, of the Jabaliya refugee camp, said he had travelled early in the morning in the hope of getting supplies from the aid trucks.</p> <p>“I decided to stay a bit away to protect myself. I convinced myself that I was in a safe area. Suddenly … there were explosions and I was hit in my leg and chest,” Ajouri said.</p> <p>There were also reports of other casualties on Friday in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, with at least 12 people killed in an airstrike on a house belonging to the Ayyash family in the central town of Deir al-Balah.</p> <p>Mohammad al-Mughayyir, the director of medical supply at the civil defence agency in Gaza, told AFP: “Forty-three martyrs have fallen as a result of the ongoing Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip since dawn today, 26 of whom were waiting for humanitarian aid.” </p> <p>Israeli military officials <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-kills-gaza-terrorist-commander-who-it-says-helped-bury-hostages-bodies/\">said on Friday</a> that warplanes had attacked 300 “terror targets” in Gaza during the week, including individual militants, weapons caches and positions used to attack Israeli forces.</p> <p>One of the strikes killed a senior militant in the territory who had helped bury the bodies of two hostages seized during the attack led by Hamas into southern Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, they said.</p> <p>Israeli military officials say troops have fired at “suspects” they claim pose a threat to them.</p> <p>James Elder, a Unicef spokesperson, told reporters in Geneva that he had many testimonials of women and children being injured while trying to receive food aid, including a young boy who was wounded by a tank shell and later died of his injuries.</p> <p>“There have been instances where information [was] shared that a [distribution] site is open, but then it’s communicated on social media that they’re closed, but that information was shared when Gaza’s internet was down and people had no access to it,” Elder said.</p> <p>The GHF releases information about opening hours of sites primarily on Facebook, which many in Gaza cannot access.</p> <p>Food has become extremely scarce in Gaza since a tight blockade on all supplies was imposed by Israel throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a <a href=\"https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1159596/?iso3=PSE\">“critical risk of famine</a>”.</p> <p>Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy. Many shipments have been stopped by ordinary Palestinians in Gaza and offloaded.</p> <p>There is also an acute shortage of fuel, which is needed for pumps on boreholes and Gaza’s sole remaining desalination plant. None has been allowed into Gaza since the collapse of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in March.</p> <p>Elder added: “We are way below emergency standards in terms of drinking water for people in Gaza. Children will begin to die of thirst … Just 40% of drinking water production facilities remain functional.”</p> <p>Fuel reserves built up during the pause in the 20-month war are now almost exhausted, aid officials said.</p> <p>Most of Gaza’s wastewater treatment plants, sewage systems, reservoirs and pipes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68969239\">have been destroyed</a>. In March, Israel cut off power supplies to the main desalination plants, a vital source of water for Palestinians in Gaza.</p> <p>Israel hopes the GHF will replace the previous comprehensive system of aid distribution run by the UN, which Israeli officials claim allowed Hamas to steal and sell aid.</p> <p>UN agencies and major aid groups, which have delivered humanitarian aid across Gaza since the start of the war, have <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/leading-aid-and-human-rights-organisations-condemn-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-dangerous-politicised-sham\">rejected the new system</a>, saying it is impractical, inadequate and unethical. They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the GHF said it had provided more than 30m meals to the people of Gaza “safely and without incident” since it began operating last month.</p> <p>Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage during the 7 October 2023 attack, of whom they still hold 53.</p> <p>The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out has reached more than 55,600, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.</p>",

Organisers say a lack of name recognition for Clarke – the reason they want the statue in the first place – is preventing them reaching their £60,000 target.</p>    <p>“Mary was injured in the <a href=\"https://www.londonmuseum.org.uk/collections/london-stories/how-black-friday-changed-suffragette-struggle/\">notorious violence of Black Friday on 18 November 1910</a>, later imprisoned for one month, enduring a hunger strike and, reportedly, forcible feeding,” said Calder. “She died of a brain haemorrhage on Christmas Day 1910, two days after her release from prison.”</p> <p>Birgit Miller, a cabinet member for culture, heritage and tourism at Brighton and Hove council, said although the campaign had all-party support, cuts meant the council could not fund it.</p> <p>“Remembering Mary is important because she dedicated her life – and ultimately sacrificed it – so women like me could have a vote,” said Miller.</p> <p>She believes Clarke has been forgotten because she died so early in the suffrage campaign. “It was only those who had been following the fight since its beginning who would have remembered who she was,” she said.</p> <p>Prof Julie Gottlieb, who was on the panel advising which names should appear on Fawcett’s plinth, said Clarke’s was never considered, even though her sister Emmeline is commemorated along with her three nieces.</p> <p>“Our priority was to be as representative as possible across all kinds of lines: demographic, political, ethnic, gender, religious and class,” she said. “I think the balance that was struck was fair and successful.”</p> <p>Clarke’s story, however, still has the power to inspire younger generations. River Isaac was seven when she read about the statue appeal in a newspaper.</p> <p>“I had been wanting to write to our headteacher to campaign for better football facilities for girls but had been too scared,” she said. “But then I thought how Mary Clarke had done all these things, even though she must have been scared, and decided it was no reason for not doing something.”</p> <p>Not only was Isaac’s appeal to the headteacher a success but she and some friends then set up the Mary’s Lamp group, asking Brighton councillors questions about women’s rights and highlighting discrimination against girls in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Women are hugely underrepresented in UK public art, statues and memorials: excluding royals, there are just over 100 statues honouring a specific woman for her achievements.</p> <p>“Visibility of women like Mary Clarke is important and we agree there should be a statue to celebrate her sacrifice in the campaign for suffrage,” said Penny East, the chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\">Fawcett Society</a>.</p> <p>Brighton was the territory where Clarke campaigned before her death at the age of 49.</p>",

As its head, Hoppy expanded its focus to gene mapping and disease genetics while also moving into the new science of gene cloning and DNA sequencing.</p> <p>Born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, to Albert Hopkinson, an iron and steelworks foreman, and Lilian (nee Siddal), a dressmaker, he went to Chesterfield grammar school, which fostered his early interest in organic chemistry. After completing a natural sciences degree at Cambridge University he qualified in medicine at the London hospital in 1959, working there until he joined the human biochemical genetics unit three years later.</p> <p>Hoppy was recruited by its inaugural head, Prof Harry Harris, becoming his right-hand man responsible for many of the unit’s innovative experimental approaches, including developing novel methods of enzyme detection and electrophoresis. </p> <p>The unit moved in 1965 from its initial base at King’s College to UCL, where I joined the unit three years later to study for a PhD under Harris. Hoppy remained there for the rest of his career. He published widely, and played an important part in teaching and supervision, being made full professor of London University in 1990. Twenty five years after his retirement, his role as mentor is remembered with great warmth by his former staff and students. </p> <p>Hoppy read widely and appreciated drama and music. A practical man who took pleasure in manual labour, he was an accomplished gardener and delighted in propagating plants and growing vegetables. He also enjoyed summers hiking in the Swiss Alps, and was a keen birdwatcher.</p> <p>In retirement, he studied architecture and German, and gained a first-class degree in geology at the Open University. He also spent many years as a volunteer at Chilterns’ Citizens Advice in Chesham, Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Prof Yvonne Edwards, and by three children, Paul, Susan and Ian, from his first marriage, to Josephine (nee Manze), which ended in divorce, and four grandchildren.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>John Major did not beat about the bush. In a <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/institute-for-government/keynote-speech-rt-hon-sir-john-major-kg-ch\">speech</a>&nbsp;this week to an Institute for Government conference marking the 30th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/event/nolan-principles-30-future-standards-public-life\">Nolan&nbsp;report</a> on standards in public life, the former prime minister went straight to the heart of the matter. “For many decades,” he said, “Britain enjoyed a global reputation&nbsp;for being free of corruption and bad practice. That is less true today. It is in our national interest to regain that reputation.”</p> <p>That is indisputably true. But it is not just the global reputation that matters. It is also, at least as significantly, the domestic one. Trust in British public life has diminished, is diminishing and urgently needs&nbsp;to be rebuilt. Confidence in politics and government to change lives is draining away. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/19/keir-starmer-needs-to-crack-down-on-misconduct-in-politics-john-major-says\">As Sir&nbsp;John said</a>, the trend needs to be reversed before the damage is “beyond salvage”. That point may, indeed, have been reached already.</p> <p>This is an issue that transcends political parties. So there is no enduring virtue in pointing out that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Standards_in_Public_Life\">the Nolan committee</a> had to be set up by Sir John precisely because of the Conservative sleaze scandals of the 1990s, the decade of David Mellor and Jonathan Aitken. Or in pointing out that most of the reputational damage highlighted in his speech was committed in more recent Tory years, under the shameful premiership of Boris Johnson in particular.</p> <p>All of that is true. But Labour governments have not been without sins of their own – some of them serious – either in the past or more recently. It does public life no favours at all to turn this into a partisan issue. Both major parties (and smaller parties too) like to pretend that they alone are virtuous and that all blame rests with the others. But that is not true.</p> <p>There is a real danger that the Starmer government and the Labour party are giving way to&nbsp;this self-deceit. Since they, they tell themselves, are good people trying to do good things, the system&nbsp;is safe and trust will be restored. That is not&nbsp;true either. It is the system that is at risk, and which needs to be rebuilt and safeguarded. The clock is ticking.</p> <p>The Nolan report’s seven principles for public life – selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership – provide a rock on which to rebuild. But, as Sir John’s speech underlines, the increasingly extensive network of ethical supervision, advice and enforcement within parliament and government is complex, fragmented, uneven and sometimes ineffective.</p> <p>Labour’s <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/change/serving-the-country/\">2024 manifesto</a> promised some reforms, including the creation of an independent ethics and integrity commission across government. Yet the manifesto remained unclear on key points. These included whether the enforcement processes would be statutory, and whether the commission would replace the network of existing machinery or be grafted on to them in some way.</p> <p>A year on from Labour’s election victory, the plan is still no clearer. The government seems to be stalling on the commission and is considering a more&nbsp;“principles-based” approach to regulation. Sir&nbsp;John thinks “stiffening up” Nolan is the key. But both approaches risk reinventing an only slightly better version of the “good chaps” system of regulation that broke down so badly under Mr&nbsp;Johnson. That is simply not good enough. Merely tweaking the system risks leaving it a scandal away from a fresh outbreak of public contempt for politics that can only help Nigel Farage.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This mechanism was due to end next April, creating a “cliff-edge” that threatened to bankrupt scores of councils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/03/a-ticking-time-bomb-the-neglected-crisis-of-send-education-in-england\">‘Ticking timebomb’: how Send spending could bankrupt English councils</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The override will now run until April 2028, the government announced as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/28/council-funding-redirected-rich-areas-most-deprived-england-local-government\">part of its wider reforms</a> to revitalise local government funding in England.</p> <p>Iain Murray, director of public financial management at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the changes have not fixed the fundamental pressures facing local governments.</p> <p>Murray said: “Without urgent solutions to both existing and future Send deficits, those councils grappling with unsustainable high-needs costs and rapidly growing cumulative deficits may, at best, be forced to make further reductions in essential services, and at worst, risk declaring themselves effectively bankrupt.”</p> <p>The Local Government Association has said more than half of councils risked becoming insolvent if the override ended next April. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/30/english-councils-send-debt-analysis\">Guardian investigation</a> revealed in March that their combined deficits would reach £5.2bn by the end of this year.</p> <p>The additional borrowing is likely to reach £200m a year in interest payments and associated costs, as well as lost income from investments and assets as councils use up their reserves to cover the deficits and loans.</p> <p>Tim Oliver, chair of the County Councils Network, said: “Council leaders can breathe a sigh of relief knowing they no longer face a financial cliff edge in nine months’ time.</p>    <p>“We now need to ensure that the government’s commitment to support councils to manage their Send deficits rings true.</p> <p>“Despite the extension of the statutory override, many councils still face a number of issues, including rising debt outstripping reserves, mounting interest payments and lost investment income. For some, this could mean reducing services elsewhere or running into extreme financial difficulty.</p> <p>“Therefore, it is critical government sets out a comprehensive solution later this year. This should include writing off deficits and compensating councils … ensuring that the slate is wiped clean.”</p> <p>Helen Hayes, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons education committee, said the extension was a “temporary fix”, and warned: “The government should not delay a permanent resolution to local authorities’ long-term Send deficits beyond 2028 and it must work to devise a solution that helps councils to achieve long-term financial sustainability and does not damage their finances further.”</p> <p>Council high-needs budgets have been under pressure from the sharp rise in children with special needs, with the number requiring extra resources detailed in education, health and care plans (EHCPs) rocketing in recent years.</p> <p>Nearly one in five schoolchildren in England now have recognised special educational needs, according to Department for Education <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/special-educational-needs-in-england/2024-25\">figures</a>, including 482,600 children with EHCPs.</p> <p>The government said it will use the two-year delay to reform how the Send system works and is funded. In that time ministers say they intend to deal with the high-needs deficits, despite only raising central funding for local government 1.1% a year on average until 2028-29.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “This government inherited a Send system left on its knees, which is why we are looking at changes through our plan for change to improve support for children and stop parents having to fight for help while bringing about financial sustainability for councils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/13/councils-in-england-warn-of-mass-bankruptcies-as-send-deficits-soar\">Councils in England warn of mass bankruptcies as Send deficits soar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We will set out our full plans for reform in the autumn, including our approach to supporting councils with their deficits, to deliver excellence everywhere for every child.”</p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-fair-funding-review-20\">measures in the consultation</a> will see government grants moved away from wealthier urban centres such as London towards to places with higher deprivation levels, as well as rural authorities and tourist hotspots where funding does not account for surges in visitors.</p> <p>Officials say the move will not lead to higher council taxes, in part because the government’s financial forecasts assume councils putting council tax up by 4.99% – the maximum increase without holding a referendum.</p> <p>Jack Shaw of Manchester University, an expert in local government, said: “The longstanding failure to reform council tax has had a more detrimental impact on councils outside London and the south-east, so it’s right that funding is corrected to take that into account. Some authorities will lose out, but there are transitional arrangements to mitigate that.</p> <p>“Council cuts under the Conservatives mean that it’ll take some time to put them on a more sustainable footing. Funding reform will improve the fortunes of many councils, but they’ll continue to face acute financial challenges.”</p>",

It will head to the House of Lords and peers are not expected to block its progress, though opponents said they would continue to fight the bill there. Royal assent is widely expected by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>It will give people with less than six months to live in England and Wales the right to an assisted death after approval from two doctors and a panel including a psychiatrist, social worker and senior lawyer.</p> \n<p>Opening the debate, Leadbeater said now was the time to seize the moment, to “correct the profound injustices of the status quo and to offer a compassionate and safe choice to terminally ill people who want to make it”.</p> \n<p>The Labour MP for Spen Valley said it was “not a choice between living and dying – it is a choice for terminally ill people about how they die”. She said rejecting the bill was “not a neutral act, it is a vote for the status quo … and it fills me with despair to think MPs could be here in another 10 years’ time hearing the same stories”.</p> \n<p>Terminally ill people and families were in the public galleries watching the debate and at a rally in Parliament Square. Dame Esther Rantzen, terminally ill with lung cancer, whom Starmer promised he would make parliamentary time to debate the bill, said she had never quite believed it would come to pass.</p> \n<p>“It won’t come in my lifetime, I won’t live long enough, but I am so relieved it will help future generations to look forward to a good death. I am astonished I have lived to see the moment,” she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/jun/20/how-did-your-mp-vote-on-the-assisted-dying-bill\">How did your MP vote on the assisted dying bill</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Concerns were raised by disability activists, who held a protest outside parliament, and MPs opposed to the bill made passionate pleas that it would lead to people being coerced into ending their lives early.</p> \n<p>The bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, a former chief nursing officer for England, said it would be a service introduced amid multiple risks to the most vulnerable, including serious shortfalls in social and palliative care.</p> \n<p>“It does not prevent terminally ill people who perceive themselves to be a burden to their families and friends from choosing assisted dying,” she said. “And it would mean that we became a society where the state fully funds a service for terminally ill people to end their own lives but shockingly only funds around one-third of palliative care.”</p> \n<p>Opening the debate for those opposed to the bill, the former foreign secretary James Cleverly said he was an atheist but had rejected the bill because he believed the right safeguards were not in place.</p> \n<p>“We were promised the gold standard, a judicially underpinned set of protections and safeguards,” he said, citing concerns from professional bodies including the Royal College of Psychiatrists. “I disagree with [Leadbeater’s] assessment that it is now or never, and it is this bill or no bill, and that to vote against this at third reading is a vote to maintain the status quo. None of those things are true.”</p> \n<p>The cabinet was deeply split on the legislation. Cabinet ministers to join Starmer voting in favour included Rachel Reeves, Yvette Cooper, John Healey, Liz Kendall, Pat McFadden, Heidi Alexander, Ed Miliband, Steve Reed and Peter Kyle.</p> \n<p>Among those opposed were Angela Rayner, Bridget Phillipson, Jonathan Reynolds, Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Darren Jones.</p> \n<p>The Labour peer Charlie Falconer will take over shepherding the bill through the Lords, with backing from Conservative peers including Michael Forsyth and the former Scottish secretary Alister Jack.</p> \n<p>Should the bill pass the Lords, there will be no provision in place for a number of years. The government and NHS have four years to implement the bill, though Leadbeater has said she hoped it would be ready sooner. There are no answers, as yet, as to whether the NHS would provide the service or private providers, or whether it would be free at the point of use.</p> \n<p>Terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months will have be of sound mind to proceed, but MPs rejected an amendment that would have prevented anyone from accessing the service on the basis of feeling too much of a burden to loved ones. There will be criminal sanctions on any family member found to be coercing someone to choose to hasten their deaths.</p> \n<p>Through the debate, proponents of the bill sought to argue that MPs could not allow the status quo to persist.</p> \n<p>The Labour MP David Burton-Sampson said his Christian beliefs had meant he was initially against assisted dying but the exertions from constituents who described their loved ones dying in excruciating pain had persuaded him to support it.</p> \n<p>“In my view, this bill has more controls than it had, the debate has been ongoing for many years, it has gone through hours of scrutiny … I believe in choice and while I believe assisted dying is not for me, it should be a choice for others,” he said. </p> \n<p>Many speaking in support or against the bill told of some of the hardest moments of their lives, such as the Conservative MP Mark Garnier, who spoke of his mother’s drawn-out death from pancreatic cancer. He said she had endured more suffering and anguish compared with a constituent with the same disease who ended their life under assisted dying laws in Spain.</p> \n<p>Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh’s voice broke with emotion describing her sister’s death from brain cancer, and her fears her life would have been shortened had such a law existed sooner.</p> \n<p>From both Labour and the Conservatives there were warnings that the bill would herald a watershed moment that could not be undone. The mother of the house, the Labour MP Diane Abbott, said MPs should oppose the bill on behalf of the marginalised.</p> \n<p>“I came to this house to be a voice for the voiceless. Who could be more voiceless than somebody who is in their sickbed and believes they are dying? I ask members in this debate to speak up for the voiceless one more time,” Abbott said. </p> \n<p>Two MPs, the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat and Labour’s Chi Onwurah, said they were deeply concerned about the fundamental shift in the role of the state, giving it the power to end life.</p> \n<p>The Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/19/labour-mp-resigns-as-government-whip-in-protest-at-benefit-cuts\">resigned a whip on Thursday night</a> in protest at the government’s disability cuts, spoke against the bill citing her fears for disabled people, as many campaigners protested outside parliament.</p> \n<p>“The vast majority of disabled people and their organisations oppose it,” she said. “They need the health and social care system fixing first. They want us as parliamentarians to assist them to live, not to die.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4b03b4c9-eb0f-40d4-9271-5c3d18908141\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X0VSfkbR50k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Starmer, a strong supporter of the law change, had made his decision to vote at third reading some time ago, but No 10 declined to disclose it in advance on the prime minister’s insistence, conscious that making a firm commitment to do so might be too leading when the government was neutral.</p> \n<p>Before the final vote on the bill, MPs passed several new amendments, including two from opponents of the bill. One would bar those who refuse food and water from being classified as having a terminal illness, though MPs concerned about anorexia said it may not prevent that slipping through the gap. The other would commission the health secretary to report on the state of palliative care.</p>",

But two trail-blazing theatre experiences are bringing the breakdown of the natural world into urban metropolises, and raising the alarm with such immediacy that even those of us fortunate enough to live in places that have so far been relatively unaffected by the climate crisis must pay attention.</p> <p>Our Story With <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/our-story-with-david-attenborough.html\">David Attenborough</a> is a breathtaking 50-minute immersive history of the planet, from the team behind the recent film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/07/ocean-with-david-attenborough-review-a-passionate-case-against-the-ruination-of-the-seas\">Ocean</a>. Thanks to 24 projectors and 50 speakers, the Natural History Museum’s Jerwood Gallery is transformed into the solar system, prehistoric caves, the ocean and the jungle. As in Maurice Sendak’s children’s classic Where the Wild Things Are, “the walls [become] the world all around”. We swim with whales and come face to face with gorillas – as Sir David did in Life on Earth in 1979. We look from space: like last year’s Booker prize-winning novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/13/samantha-harvey-interview-booker-winning-novel-orbital\">Orbital</a>, by Samantha Harvey, Our Story inspires the feelings of awe and protectiveness towards our planet that astronauts call “the overview effect”.</p> <p>In the past, Sir David has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/22/david-attenborough-climate-change-bbc\">accused</a> of not speaking out strongly enough on human-made ecological disaster. But the Guardian writer George Monbiot, once one of his fiercest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/07/david-attenborough-world-environment-bbc-films\">critics</a>, described Ocean, released for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/03/david-attenborough-birthday-99-by-barack-obama-billie-eilish-morgan-freeman\">Sir David’s 99th birthday</a> this year, as the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/13/ocean-film-world-david-atenborough-documentary-fishing-industry\">“I’ve been waiting for all my working life”</a>. In Our Story, we journey through mass extinctions of the past and, speculatively, in the future. Without change, “the prospect for the generations that follow is grim”, the audience is warned.</p> <p>Next Friday, hundreds of lifesize elephants, giraffes, gazelles and animal puppets of all kinds will stampede through London’s streets on their 20,000km journey from central Africa to the Arctic Circle. <a href=\"https://www.theherds.org/\">The Herds</a> is the follow-up project to <a href=\"https://www.walkwithamal.org/\">The Walk</a>. In 2021, a 12-foot puppet girl, Little Amal, travelled from the Turkey-Syria border to London, to raise awareness of the refugee crisis. Little Amal reached 2 million people in 17 countries. Now her creators hope to do the same for the climate emergency. As the herd flees <a href=\"https://www.theherds.org/route\">north</a>, it will be joined by puppets of native species from each country it visits. Manchester is its next destination, before continuing on to Scandinavia.</p> <p>The project’s artistic director, Amir Nizar Zuabi, has acknowledged that all such endeavours, however ambitious, are just <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amir_nizar_zuabi_the_herds_a_vast_act_of_theater_to_spark_climate_action?language=en\">“water dripping on a stone”</a>. But, as he says, over time enough drips can reshape a stone.</p> <p>These are visceral, sensory immersions. Like Olafur Eliasson’s climate art installation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/02/how-we-made-olafur-eliasson-the-weather-project\">The Weather Project</a> at Tate Modern in 2003, such spectaculars invite us to reflect together – they are collective experiences. This is the theatre of the Anthropocene: vast, cataclysmic, beautiful and yet ultimately hopeful as well. They help us visualise what a different world might look like – if only politicians and corporations were made to act. The next chapter is up to us. As Sir David says at the end of Our Story, we must work towards a time when Earth becomes a planet “with not only an intelligent species, but a wise one too”.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Known for his quiet leadership, sharp eye for design and sense of loyalty, he left a mark on both the creative industry and the communities that he helped to build.<br><br>Born in Bridgend, south Wales, Garnet was the son of Violet (nee Walters) and Douglas Edwards, a quarryman. He was educated at Oldcastle primary and Bridgend grammar school (later Brynteg school). He thrived academically but was most at home on the rugby pitch or fishing with his brother, Les, on the Ogmore river.</p> <p>He studied graphic design at Manchester School of Art (now part of Manchester Metropolitan University), graduating with first-class honours, and went on to a successful career in advertising, working at several leading agencies in London, most notably Grey. He also helped to set up Wright &amp; Partners in the 1980s with his close friend Johnny Wright.</p>    <p>Throughout his career he mentored a generation of creatives, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/15/trevor-beattie-mediaguardian-100-2010\">Trevor Beattie</a>, who would go on to lead major campaigns for Virgin, FCUK and Wonderbra. Garnet is remembered as an exacting leader who believed “creative is king” and he approached his work with equal parts craftsmanship and humour. He led national and global campaigns for Nissan, Crown Paints, Vodafone, the Labour party, Thistle Hotels and Alfa Romeo, among others. He won many prizes for his work, including Clio and Design &amp; Art Direction awards.<br><br>Outside the design studio, Garnet’s other great passion was rugby. He played for Bridgend Sports RFC, Finchley RFC and Middlesex, and later served as coach and president at Finchley, where he helped transform the club’s fortunes and launched its now thriving youth section. A return to Bridgend in the 90s led him to do the same there. An annual youth award at Bridgend Sports now bears his name.<br><br>Garnet was devoted to his wife, Jennifer (nee Grinnell), whom he met as a teenager and married in 1968. After her death in 2014, he found companionship with Kathryn Lewis, a family friend. He was a hands-on grandfather, a lover of French cheeses and port, and a great storyteller.</p> <p>Former colleagues fondly recall his notorious “9x9 Club” – nine pints by 9am – and his love of mischief, typified by pranks such as luring pigs into his local pub in Ogmore, south Wales.<br><br>Garnet is survived by his children, Megan, Rhys and me, and seven grandchildren.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My father, Paul Baker, who has died aged 77, was a co-founder in 1975 of the Ohal consultancy, which pioneered the use of econometric analysis to help clients understand what drove their sales and profits, forecast the impact of different investment scenarios and optimise future marketing. </p> <p>The consultancy prospered despite the efforts of several advertising agencies to put them out of business, as prospective clients now needed to consider this new, more rigorous approach to evaluating their marketing strategies.</p> <p>Among the many big-name clients Paul advised were Andrex, for whom he assessed the benefit of using their puppy adverts for toilet paper, and Sainsbury’s, with whom he calculated the value of featuring Jamie Oliver in its marketing campaigns.</p> <p>Although his business partner, Callaghan O’Herlihy, retired in 1994 and Ohal was sold in 1999 to the advertising company WPP, Paul continued to work for Ohal until his retirement in 2007. This ensured that his influence extended to a new generation of experts in econometrics.</p> <p>Paul was born in Malvern, Worcestershire, to Peggy (nee Cook), a housemistress at Malvern girls’ college (now Malvern St James), and her husband, Dennis, an accountant. One of four siblings, he enjoyed a happy childhood roaming around the Malvern Hills.</p> <p>After leaving the King’s school in Worcester, where he was head boy, Paul went to Exeter University in 1967 to study statistics. His first job was at the tea company Brooke Bond in London, as an operational researcher, problem solving and writing small computer programs to help departments while they waited for bigger computer systems to materialise. At Brooke Bond he met Marion Clarke, who was working in a similar role, and they married in 1978, settled in Beckenham, in the London Borough of Bromley, and raised three children, Gail, Patrick and me.</p> <p>Paul left Brooke Bond to co-found Ohal with Callaghan, whom he had first met when Callaghan went to Brooke Bond as a consultant to help with an advertising effectiveness project. At Ohal Paul had a gift for simplifying the most complex ideas.</p> <p>Known for his wit and humour, Paul had the ability to brighten any room he entered, and his perspectives were invaluable to those who sought his counsel.</p> <p>He was a sports enthusiast who particularly liked swimming and playing golf. He travelled around the world to watch British &amp; Irish Lions rugby union tours, cricket world cups and Ryder Cup golf tournaments, and held debentures at Twickenham and Lord’s. He was also a governor at Cator Park school for girls (now Harris Girls’ Academy Bromley) in Beckenham from 2008 until 2012 </p> <p>He is survived by Marion, Gail, Patrick and me, seven grandchildren, and by his siblings, David, Mark and Alison.</p>",

            "body" : "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\">Canada’s</a> Liberal government is poised to pass controversial legislation on Friday that aims to kick-start “nation building” infrastructure projects but has received widespread pushback from Indigenous communities over fears it tramples on their constitutional rights.</p> <p>On its final day of sitting before breaking for summer, parliament is expected to vote on Bill C-5. The legislation promised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a>, the prime minister, during the federal election, is meant to strengthen Canada’s economy amid a trade war launched by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>The bill removes interprovincial trade barriers and aims to prioritize infrastructure projects, such as energy pipelines and mines deemed to be in the national interest.</p> <p>It is the latter portion of the bill that has caused concern among Indigenous communities over fears the government, granted broad powers, could speed up approvals for infrastructure and energy projects and override protest from Indigenous communities.</p> <p>Ahead of the vote, Carney defended the legislation, which was amended earlier this week to ease concerns from Indigenous leadership.</p> <p>“At the heart of this legislation is… not just respect for, but full embrace of, free, prior and informed consent. It has to be seen in parallel with very major measures that this government is taking to not just support those partnerships, but also to finance equity ownership in these nation-building projects for Indigenous peoples, Indigenous groups, Indigenous rights holders,” said Carney.</p> <p>Under Canadian law, the crown has a “duty to consult” Indigenous communities on projects that could adversely affect them. “Consultation, co-operation, engagement, participation is at the heart of C-5 and that is how you build a nation. And that’s very much how we’ve designed it,” Carney said.</p> <p>While the bill says the government must consult Indigenous communities in cases where their rights are affected by a fast-tracked project, it also allows the Liberal cabinet to overrule pre-existing laws to speed up permits for major projects.</p> <p>The federal legislation comes as provinces also pass bills that speed up infrastructure projects. Ontario plans to create “special economic zones” that would bypass all provincial laws, amid tensions between the premier and First Nations chiefs in areas slated for mining.</p> <p>Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, provoked criticism earlier this week criticized for saying First Nations communities “keep coming hat in hand all the time to the government” for more money. He apologized the following day after meeting with chiefs from the Anishinabek Nation, which represents 39 of Ontario’s 133 First Nations chiefs.</p> <p>“I get pretty passionate. And I just want to say, I sincerely apologize for my words, not only if it hurt all the chiefs in that room, but all First Nations,” said Ford. “I get passionate because I want prosperity for their communities.”</p> <p>Both the federal and provincial legislation reflect the friction between speedy resource and infrastructure development and the need to consult with affected communities that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/pays-plat-first-nation-treaty-canada\">historically marginalized</a>, both socially and economically.</p> <p>Earlier this week Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, the Assembly of First Nations national chief, warned the federal bill was being “rammed through” parliament.</p> <p>“First Nations are united,” she told CBC News. “They want prosperity, but they don’t want it at the expense of our rights.”</p> <p>Woodhouse Nepinak says she and other leaders across the country want the government to pause the bill for more study. But Carney is eager to pass the bill, fulfilling a campaign promise that his government would eliminate internal trade barriers by 1 July. Indigenous leaders have warned a failure to fully consult on the bill could lead to widespread national protests, akin to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/11/canada-indigenous-people-demand-better-deal\">the Idle No More movement</a> in 2012.</p>",

Dunbar blamed his actions on having lost a bet he had placed on the tie.</p> <p>“I welcome the sentence that has been handed to Dunbar and I hope that it acts as a warning to other social media users, demonstrating that you will be held accountable for what you post”, said chief constable Mark Roberts, the head of English football policing.</p> <p>“Everyone is responsible for what they do and say, and posting a message on social media is no different. In this case, Dunbar sent a racist comment directly to Wreh on Instagram, thinking that he would be able to hide behind his account name.</p> <p>“We have been clear that hate crime online or in person, is not acceptable and as we have shown in this case, you cannot hide behind a social media profile to post vile comments and spread hate.”</p> <p>Wreh, a substitute for Tamworth in the match, discovered the direct message to his Instagram account on returning home.

            "body" : "<p>According to George Monbiot, fishing is “the most destructive of all private industries” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/13/ocean-film-world-david-atenborough-documentary-fishing-industry\">Attenborough’s Ocean is the film I’ve been waiting my whole career for – now the world must act on its message, 13&nbsp;June</a>). Have fossil fuel lobbyists finally got to him?</p> <p>Monbiot is right to highlight our complacency with overfishing, but&nbsp;in our attempts to tackle industrial fishing’s worst abuses, especially unchecked bottom trawling, we should not demonise small‑scale fishers – our ocean’s most powerful custodians.</p> <p>Across the globe, small‑scale fishers using low‑impact gear in coastal waters are on the frontlines against industrial overfishing. They’re the first to feel the impacts of ocean decline and the best-placed to propose solutions.</p> <p>Is it true that “the fishing industry trashes everything”? No. Some gears, like bottom trawls, are indeed destructive and should be restricted. But small-scale fisheries using low-impact gears are the opposite. They use environmentally friendly&nbsp;methods to provide healthy, low-carbon food to coastal&nbsp;communities.</p> <p>Is fishing really “the most destructive of all private industries”? No. Fossil fuel, mining and chemical lobbyists will be smiling as readers direct their ire towards the local inshore fishing fleet.</p> <p>Should the UK government redirect funding away from fishing and let the industry fade? No. Current subsidies unfairly favour industrial vessels with outsized impacts. Redistributing funds and rapidly scaling investment in small‑scale fisheries would deliver dividends through resilient food systems, enhanced food security, sustainable livelihoods and greater climate resilience, alongside healthier ecosystems.</p> <p>Should the oceans be closed to fishing, bar a few gazetted areas? No. Coastal waters should be fully co‑managed with small-scale fishers to ensure they are stewarded for future generations.</p> <p>The world is awakening to the impacts of bottom trawling. Now it must wake up to the vital importance of small‑scale fisheries&nbsp;– and fast.<br><strong>Tom Collinson</strong><br><em>Advocacy manager, Blue Ventures</em></p> <p>• I read George Monbiot’s article with interest. I am one of the producers of Rupert Murray’s 2009 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/end-line-film-fish\">The End of the Line</a>, which was about marine destruction, was funded in part by Channel&nbsp;4, and broadcast by it. This film did not “carefully avoid” blaming the fishing industry, and an independent study showed that it had an impact on public attitudes, corporate behaviour and political&nbsp;policy.</p> <p>That film drew heavily on the previous work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/02/labour-needs-to-fix-british-fishing-will-it-stand-by-its-principles-now-it-is-in-power\">Charles Clover</a>, who appeared in the film and whose 2004 book of the same title was a milestone in the campaign to save the world’s oceans.</p> <p>It is not just a question of making good and powerful programmes. Today, those have to have a celebrity at the front of them, and a lasting impact is achieved by a sustained and continuous campaign from civil society groups&nbsp;and journalism – in George’s words “those whose job it is to inform us”. My concern is that after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/07/ocean-with-david-attenborough-review-a-passionate-case-against-the-ruination-of-the-seas\">Ocean</a>, the BBC will think&nbsp;“job&nbsp;done” and everyone else&nbsp;in the media will agree. <br><strong>Christopher Hird</strong><br><em>Dartmouth Films</em></p> <p>• Many of us echo George Monbiot’s “At last!” in response to David Attenborough’s film. But I was disappointed that the names of the trawlers plundering the oceans were blurred. It is about time the international companies plundering our oceans’ ecosystems were publicly shamed.</p> <p>Environmental NGOs, especially local ones using citizen scientists to gather data in their own time and often unpaid, have amassed millions of pieces of relevant data, especially from inshore waters. Yet we still have long “consultations” on marine protected areas, usually resulting in nothing changing. I have completed four in recent years about Scottish inshore waters. There is collusion between UK governments and their national scientific and nature conservation organisations in this, and environmental NGOs, in fear of losing finance, grants etc stay silent.</p> <p>The government has procrastinated in ratifying the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/05/high-seas-treaty-agreement-to-protect-international-waters-finally-reached-at-un\">UN high seas treaty</a> agreeing to put 30% of these waters into marine protected areas. Ecosystems are the lifeblood of our oceans and ultimately us. Overfishing, short-term greed and financial returns are the name of this game.

            "body" : "<p>On 13 June, the Guardian published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/13/russia-adviser-fiona-hill-alarming-conclusion\">collective letter concerning Russia’s war</a> and attacking Dr Fiona Hill, the chancellor of Durham University and one of the principal authors of the UK’s strategic defence review. As UK-based and/or British-educated experts in matters pertaining to Russia, Ukraine and international security, we voice our profound disagreement with the letter by Robert Skidelsky, Richard Balfe, Anthony Brenton, Thomas Fazi, Anatol Lieven, Ian Proud, Geoffrey Roberts, Richard Sakwa and Brigitte Granville.</p> <p>They say that Dr Hill represents “the warmongering mood of official Britain”. But there is only one warmonger on the European stage, and that is Vladimir Putin. It is neither a “false premise” nor a “mad conclusion” to argue that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has the goal of restoring Russia to the status of a world power, and that the departure of the US would leave Russia “the dominant military power in all of Europe”. In reality,&nbsp;governments and independent experts from across Europe, ourselves included, have reached conclusions very similar to Dr Hill’s, as they are supported by empirical evidence – not least by Putin’s own overtly stated&nbsp;aspirations.</p> <p>One wonders what “precautions” the signatories would advise Britain to take in the event of a US pullout from Europe. The once – and perhaps still – friendly contacts in Russian officialdom that some of the letter’s authors maintain&nbsp;will&nbsp;not help.</p> <p><strong>Roy Allison</strong> <em>School of Global and

Around 14&nbsp;million people may be living with undiagnosed insomnia, and yet just one in six of those with symptoms has received a formal diagnosis. </p> <p>Despite National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance recommending cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the first-line treatment since at least 2009, face-to-face is rarely available on the NHS. Nice has also recommended cost-saving digital CBT-I for over three years and yet this has still not been funded for patients nationally. Without access to effective non-drug interventions, families are turning to unregulated sleep aids out of desperation. But melatonin is not a catch-all solution – and unsupervised use, particularly in children, carries risks.</p> <p>We urgently need a national sleep strategy. That includes national availability of digital CBT-I, funding for CBT-I in every local integrated care board in the NHS, public health campaigns to improve sleep literacy, and better training for GPs, who are often left with little choice but to prescribe medication. Despite the known harms and guidance advising on their risks, NHS data shows that over 5m prescriptions for sleeping pills are still written each year, and the number of children receiving these drugs has tripled since 2015.</p> <p>Parents should not have to rely on imported supplements to help their children sleep. Sleep is a fundamental part of health, not a luxury.

The visitor from San Francisco who remarked that it is “a place where people want to put on airs” is right: and I rejoice that it is so.

Of course it is. How dull life would be without such magical make-believe. The Ritz has lifted my spirits regularly for 60 years.

            "body" : "<p>I agree with Rachel Aroesti that Brian Wilson was a gift to humanity, and I love his music (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/jun/14/brian-wilson-was-a-musical-genius-are-there-any-left?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Brian Wilson was a musical genius. Are there any left?, 14 June</a>). But musical genius should not be equated with mainstream success – music exists to be appreciated by whomever it reaches. And I could name many lesser-known musicians who still push the boundaries of sound: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/anna-meredith\">Anna Meredith</a>’s marrying of electronic and classical springs to mind, for example, or <a href=\"https://annabsavage.bandcamp.com/album/you-i-are-earth\">Anna B Savage</a>’s mix of intimate pop vocals with soaring folk arrangements.</p> <p>Beyond that, Aroesti seems to be working from a very narrow frame of cultural reference. Her article says Wilson was “lyrically radical” in transforming pop into an “emotional autobiography”, in the words of Wilson’s biographer David Leaf. What about French chansons that dominated Europe in the 1940s and 1950s and brought autobiographical lyrics into the mainstream?</p> <p>Aroesti also suggests pop music reached its apotheosis in the 1960s and is now repeating itself – which overlooks the fundamental truth that all art is in conversation with itself, on a never-ending journey of development. Sure, Shakespeare and Chekhov were unusually great, but there were some decent plays written in the 300-plus years between them, and we’d never have got to Chekhov without the stepping stones of all the interim works.</p> <p>I suggest Aroesti spends some time reflecting on the system she lives in, which seems to lead her to believe that the only remaining musical geniuses are all over 70 (and mostly boomer white men). In the meantime, I’m off to listen to Kae Tempest (a&nbsp;genius, in my eyes).<br><strong>Anoushka Lucas</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• The question posed in Rachel Aroesti’s article is provocative, but the frame is narrow. It treats “musical genius” as if it exists primarily within western pop and rock, ignoring the extraordinary musical invention happening in pop music across the globe and in other genres. Brian Wilson was a brilliant innovator, but he drew inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/article/brian-wilson-my-music-when-i-was-growing-up-i-listened-to-a-great-deal-of-bach-and-tchaikovsky-that-was-my-musical-education\">classical, jazz and experimental music</a>. Aroesti briefly touches on the Beatles, but not on their immersion in Indian music. This interconnectedness matters. Genius is rarely confined by&nbsp;geography or genre.</p> <p>If Aroesti thinks pop feels stagnant, perhaps that says more about the industry in the west than about the existence of genius. It may not always be packaged for British or US charts, but that does not mean it has vanished. We have more music available at our fingertips than at any other point in our history; we just need to listen more widely.<br><strong>Tarik O’Regan</strong><br><em>San Francisco, California, US</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Behind the Western Terrace a lengthy queue snaked towards the main bar with a second queue just beyond for the chance to join it (the hack for anyone stuck in this situation is to climb the stairs at the back of the adjacent Howard Stand and give one of the underemployed bar staff there something to do). After eventually being served fans edged their way nervously through the masses carrying their drinks on flimsy cardboard trays, rendered ever flimsier by the beer inevitably sloshing over them.</p> <p>There were surprisingly few India fans – rumours swirled that a rush of tickets had found their way on to the secondary market as soon as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/12/virat-kohli-india-cricket-retires-test\">Virat Kohli retired</a> – though the fact that in most of the ground the seats are much the same colour as their white-ball kit sometimes made it appear otherwise. Among their number was one who arrived just after play began, child in tow. Dad wore an India shirt, son full cricket whites accessorised with an England flag draped around his shoulders like a cape, with the crown of his head poking through a hole in a large sheet of cardboard to produce a makeshift sombrero. In most of this ground shade has to be self-created, and this promised to be a day that needed it.</p>    <p>Though a pleasant breeze took the edge off it, at lunch the biggest queues were for the water refill stations, and by tea the bars were virtually deserted but heaven help anyone who wanted an ice cream. A previously rather flat atmosphere perked up soon afterwards, potentially assisted by copious quantities of soft serve. Flake? Not us, pal.</p> <p>Unfortunately the possibility of genuinely hot weather did not seem to have occurred to whoever planned the catering operation, leaving fans with an entirely unseasonal choice between such offerings as burgers, southern fried chicken and loaded fries. Pity the man staffing the wood-fired pizza oven, which was positioned next to the fish and chips truck – by the end of the lunch break its peas were not the only things that were mushy. The fans nevertheless attacked the offering just as Yashasvi Jaiswal tucked into England’s bowling: with relish (ketchup, in most cases). In all this the only sign of fresh fruit and vegetables was the group of fans in the Western Terrace who came dressed as two bananas, three strawberries, an orange and an avocado.</p> <p>There is something particularly appealing about a stadium that is part of another different stadium, with the structure known to cricket fans as the Howard Stand Siamese-twinned with the rugby league ground’s North Stand, but there is no clever design that can disguise the lack of space behind some areas of the ground when there is no play on. Into the lunchtime throng behind the East Stand, a mixture of food stall queues and people endeavouring to walk around the ground in both directions, was thrown a group of bhangra drummers, four men making the noise of 10, who attracted a sizeable crowd while they added bonus percussion to an unlikely mashup of Peter Andre’s Mysterious Girl and Shaggy’s take on In the Summertime. They set up opposite the Gray-Nicolls stall, thereby ensuring the area had both&nbsp;bats and a racket, and there was not a bar in the ground with as many bottlenecks.</p> <p>Probably the most surprising lunchtimely hold-up though was on the otherwise deserted stairs outside the players’ changing rooms, where for a while India’s Kuldeep Yadav somehow found himself stuck without the pass necessary to convince the security staff stationed there that he should be allowed in, or a phone to summon anyone to vouch for him. Eventually the guard allowed him through – in his own sweet time.</p>",

Or I could point out how <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-myths-of-sex/202409/the-best-kept-secret-for-menopause-relief-masturbation\">Kinsey Institute research</a> suggests regular masturbation can help relieve and prevent symptoms of menopause, such as vaginal atrophy. I could even tell you that <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2024.2304575#d1e3550\">studies demonstrate</a> a significant correlation between intimate toy ownership and greater satisfaction – not only with sex but also with life itself.</p> <p>But the potted version is that orgasms and erotic pleasure are glorious, and top-class toys can help you savour more of both. So here are the best vibrators available. Scroll to the bottom to find out how I selected these vibrators from the 53 I tested for this piece.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>At a glance</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best bullet vibrator overall:<br></strong>We-Vibe Tango X<br><a href=\"https://www.we-vibe.com/uk/tango-x\"><sub>£79 at We Vibe</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best rabbit vibrator overall:</strong><br>Je Joue Hera Flex<br><a href=\"https://www.jejoue.co.uk/products/hera-flex-rabbit-vibrator\"><sub>£99 at Je Joue</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best wand vibrator overall:</strong><br>Doxy Die Cast By You<br><a href=\"https://doxymassager.com/product/custom-die-cast/\"><sub>From £174.99 at Doxy</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’m a multi-award-winning writer, broadcaster and educator with more than two decades of experience specialising in sexual wellbeing and culture. I’ve worked as an expert independent research and development consultant for more than a dozen adult product companies; I’m a board member of the <a href=\"https://www.vaginamuseum.co.uk/\">Vagina Museum</a> in London; I’m a campaigner for sexual health and gynaecological charities, including <a href=\"https://www.tht.org.uk/\">Terrence Higgins Trust</a> and <a href=\"https://eveappeal.org.uk/\">the Eve Appeal</a>; and I helped write many of your favourite characters’ lines about dildos, douching and desire in the hit Netflix series Sex Education. All this means I’m well qualified to assess whether these devices have been crafted decently.</p> <p>I’m also a freelancer who works from home. I’ll leave it at that.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Types of vibrator</h2>    <p>Asking, “What’s the best sex toy?” is a bit like asking, “What’s the best tool?”: a plethora exists, and selecting the most suitable one is influenced by what you want it to do. Here, I’ve examined three popular styles of vibrators.</p> <p><strong>Bullets<br></strong>Small, versatile vibrators for external use only. They’re primarily designed for targeted clitoral stimulation but can be used to tickle nipples, glide up the insides of thighs, or take on a tour practically anywhere on the body (except inside the anus – that’s not safe).</p> <p><strong>Wands<br></strong>Large vibrators with broad heads, again for external use only. Wands deliver the most powerful vibrations over a wide area – this sector is where you’ll find the most bone-shaking master blasters on the market. Fantastic for people who need intense stimulation, and good for deep body massage, too.</p> <p><strong>Rabbits<br></strong>These vibrators have two parts: an insertable shaft, designed to stimulate inside the vaginal canal and excite the G-spot, and an external head that stimulates the clitoris. This “dual stimulation” is intended to provoke a “blended orgasm”: a climax induced by mixing multiple forms of simultaneously delivered sensation. </p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best bullet vibrators</h2> <p><em><strong>Best bullet vibrator overall</strong></em><em>:</em> <strong><br></strong><strong>We-Vibe Tango X</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.we-vibe.com/tango-x\"><sub>£79 at We-Vibe</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.sinful.co.uk/p/we-vibe-tango-x-bullet-vibrator/1024057\"><sub>£79.99 at Sinful</sub></a></p> <p>The original Tango came out about 15 years ago, and it’s consistently remained so high up in expert rankings that by this stage it might have altitude sickness.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong><br>Its Goat status is justified: while many bullets offer “buzzy”, high-frequency vibrations that don’t travel far into the body, the Tango is satisfyingly “rumbly” for its size, providing additional lower-frequency stimulation that carries deeper into tissues and awakens more nerve endings. It packs a lot of oomph into its small size.</p> <p>This latest incarnation features a silicone grip to make it less slippery to hold, while the business end remains hard and glossy. There’s nothing to muffle the vibrations: they’re full-on and focused, which is<em> exactly</em> what tickles many people’s pickles. Others may find the feeling too “sharp”, however.</p> <p>Three separate buttons to increase/decrease power and change pulse patterns make it easy to find the exact output to suit you. There’s excellent variety between the settings, the lowest of which is more a brisk twitch than a vibration. Plus, a travel lock means you won’t have to trot out the “it must be my electric toothbrush!” line when your handbag starts humming.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the magnetic charger can be accidentally knocked off its connections, but it’s more hygienic than a lead that needs to plug into a hole in the toy.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> eight<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> two hours<br><strong>Charge time: </strong>one hour and 30 minutes<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> two years </p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>bullet for innovation:</strong></em><strong> <br></strong><strong>Hot Octopuss AMO</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.hotoctopuss.com/products/female-sex-toys-amo-the-powerful-and-focused-whisper-quiet-bullet-vibrator\"><sub>£49.95 at Hot Octopuss</sub></a></p> <p>Another tiny yet mighty toy that, given its petite dimensions, is a powerful rumbler.

It’s made of silky silicone, which – unlike tougher plastics – won’t hurt or slide around if you press down on it to apply extra pressure.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the battery life isn’t better, and the payoff of the inventive contours is that the AMO can’t be inserted into strap-ons, dildos or other toys that rely on a standard-shape bullet.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> six<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> five<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> 40 minutes<br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two to three hours<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> one year</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>sustainable bullet:</strong></em><strong> <br>Love Not War Maya</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://veo.world/product/maya\"><sub>£99.99 at Veo</sub></a></p> <p>If you want to feel the earth move without harming the planet, Love Not War is your friend with benefits. Its Maya bullet is made from recycled aluminium in a hydroelectric-powered factory, and minimally packaged in a brown cardboard box printed with soy ink. <br><br><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Seven different screw-on heads are sold separately to convert the bullet into, say, <a href=\"https://www.l-n-w.com/products/laska-head-rabbit-vibrator-couples-play\">a rabbit</a> or <a href=\"https://www.l-n-w.com/products/kama-head-couples-g-spot-vibrator-couples-play\">a G-spot probe</a>. Interchangeable efforts I’ve tried in the past have suffered from insufficiently strong motors, so they haven’t been able to successfully transmit vibrations throughout each attachment, especially longer/larger ones. Love Not War is mounting an admirable battle against that challenge, however.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> at more than £50 a pop, amassing a collection of heads will cost you a pretty penny – although the brand will plant a tree for each one sold.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> four<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> one hour<br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two hours<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> Love Not War will repair toys to keep them alive for as long as possible</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/19/best-self-care-treats\">‘Expect to see snake-like peeling’: 19 self-care treats for the perfect pick-me-up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best soft </strong></em><em><strong>and sensual option:</strong></em><strong> <br>Smile Makers The Firefighter</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/smile-makers-the-firefighter-10302302\"><sub>£44.95 at Boots</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.beautybay.com/p/smile-makers/the-firefighter/\"><sub>£49.95 at Beauty Bay</sub></a></p> <p>Bullets are often designed to treat the genitals like a game of darts: if the clitoris is the bullseye, they aim to hit it dead on. The Firefighter instead approaches stimulation more like a curling match: gently brushing, sweeping and edging towards a climax.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The fluttering, flickering flame-shaped head will suit those who prefer a slow, delicate buildup before switching to the more traditional, targeted “pointy finger” part of the toy.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it only comes in pink. <a href=\"https://smilemakerscollection.com/products/the-surfer\">The Surfer</a>, another Smile Makers bullet, is a refreshingly unusual zesty orange.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> four<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> two<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> three hours<br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two to two-and-a-half hours<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> two years</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>budget bullet</strong></em><em><strong>:<br></strong></em><strong>The Rocks Off </strong><strong>RO-90</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://rocks-off.com/products/ro90-peacock-petals\"><sub>£5.50 at Rocks Off</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rocks-Touch-Velvet-Bullet-Vibrator/dp/B0F3372V2L\"><sub>£15.95 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>Rocks Off makes a whole shooting range of cheap-and-cheerful battery-powered bullets. Take your pick of pointed, rounded, angled or lipstick-shaped tip; select a slick gloss, powdery matt or silicone finish; and choose from more colours than the fabric of Joseph’s Dreamcoat, including one that changes from purple to pink in response to body heat.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>It’s a fair amount of bang for very few bucks. I singled out the RO-90 as my best budget buy because the AAA battery it takes is much easier to source than the N-size variety inside <a href=\"https://rocks-off.com/products/ro80-rainbow\">the smaller RO-80 model</a>. The slightly longer shaft makes it better suited to use for penetrative play, too, if that’s your bag.</p> <p>Hats off to Rocks Off as well for its four-year collaboration with disability charity Enhance The UK to develop <a href=\"https://rocks-off.com/collections/quest\">a truly accessible toy range, Quest</a>. A 5% share of sales from that collection goes back to the charity.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> single-button controls mean you have to cycle all the way through speeds/pulses to change them. I also question how the shiny metallic finishes might stand up to long-term cleaning.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> three<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> 1 x AAA battery<br><strong>Run time:</strong> three hours 30 minutes<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> two years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best rabbit vibrators</h2> <p><em><strong>Best rabbit vibrator overall</strong></em><em><strong>:</strong></em> <br><strong>Je Joue Hera Flex</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.jejoue.co.uk/products/hera-flex-rabbit-vibrator\"><sub>£99 at Je Joue</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://shespot.co.uk/products/hera-flex-rabbit-vibrator-black\"><sub>£109 at SheSpot</sub></a></p> <p>The Hera Flex is such a good problem-solver, it could probably win an algebra contest.<strong> </strong>Since everyone’s anatomy is different and distances between vaginas and clitorises vary, a frequent dilemma with rabbits is that once the shaft is inserted, the external stimulator doesn’t quite rest on the right spot. Many toys are too rigid to allow sufficient bending and angle adjustment to solve this issue.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>This Je Joue genius solves that: it’s as flexible as a yoga master and both parts of it are poseable, allowing you to easily customise how it curves to fit your bits. Another irritating rabbit habit is that the “ears” intended to tickle either side of the clitoris can pinch, poke or catch against sensitive flesh, depending on how your body happens to be built. Here, the Hera is a hero once more, replacing the traditional bunny head with a plush, spongy, smooth “thumb”. If you’re someone with a more frilly clitoral hood or labia that gets painfully pulled by rabbit ears, this could be a real thumbs up. A quality, thoughtfully re-engineered rabbit reboot.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>there’s a bit of a jump between the first two power levels. A steadier climb would be preferable. The squishiness of the Hera Flex won’t suit folks who prefer firmer pressure on their hotspots, either. But as so often in the world of sex toys, that’s rather like saying, “people who prefer raspberries shouldn’t choose this banana”; it’s a question of taste, rather than a product being bad.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> five<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> one hour<br><strong>Charge time: </strong>one hour and 30 minutes<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>one year</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best for temperature titillation:</strong></em><strong> <br></strong><strong>Lovehoney Glow Bunny</strong><strong> </strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/sex-toys/vibrators/rabbit-vibrators/p/lovehoney-glow-bunny-rechargeable-warming-and-cooling-rabbit-vibrator/a48172g85909.html\"><sub>£79.99 at Lovehoney</sub></a></p> <p>If you just want to use this toy as an old-school rabbit, it’s a solid choice … but it also has new-fangled tricks up its sleeve.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The temperature-play plate on the top of the shaft heats to 38C in less than two minutes, feeling almost like a warm tongue, and swiftly cools to 18C, giving a whole new meaning to “Netflix and chill”. I imagine the cold setting could be particularly enticing during sweltering summer nights, and it works nicely for nipple play, too.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the power is perfectly acceptable, but not perfect for the power-hungry.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> three<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> four<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> one hour <br><strong>Charge time: </strong>three hours<strong><br></strong><strong>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>100 days</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>for air pulse stimulation:</strong></em> <strong><br>Womanizer D</strong><strong>uo 2</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.womanizer.com/uk/duo2\"><sub>£189 at Womanizer</sub></a><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/womanizer-duo-2-pleasure-air-toy-black-10333511\"><sub>£189 at Boots</sub></a></p> <p>Admittedly, this looks more like something Star Trek’s Captain Picard should be at the helm of than a conventional rabbit. Rather than stimulating the clitoris with vibrations, the Duo 2 uses pulses of air to create a throbbing, sucking effect. Womanizer was the first to introduce this technology to the adult market in 2014, when it represented one of the most groundbreaking innovations in years.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The firm continues to be a pioneer. This toy boasts multiple proprietary features, including “Smart Silence”: it will only turn on when in contact with skin. This means the battery life is preserved, <em>and</em> you don’t have to fumble to switch it off in a panic if your intimacy is interrupted.</p> <p>An Autopilot mode alternates between surprise pulse patterns and intensities to prevent masturbation from becoming predictable, while the Afterglow setting helps you gradually wind down post-climax, rather than simply switching off.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the shape takes getting used to, and there are now more intuitive (and affordable) suction and vibration rabbit toys available. That said, I believe the Duo 2 is worth mastering due to its god-tier-level exclusive features. </p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> 14<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> 10<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run</strong><strong> time:</strong> two hours <br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two hours<strong><br></strong><strong>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>five years</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>for an innovative shaft:</strong></em> <strong><br></strong><strong>Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.satisfyer.com/uk/satisfyer-air-pump-bunny-1\"><sub>£35.37 at Satisfyer</sub></a><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Satisfyer-Vibrator-Skin-Friendly-Rechargeable-Inflatable/dp/B0C664KBNM\"><sub>£39.97 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>Satisfyer is known for two things. First, making excellent-quality, more affordable “dupes” of aspirational high-end sex toys – almost like an Aldi version of Lelo and co. Second, and in contrast to the first, rolling out <em>vast </em>multitudes of its own novel inventions, including this Air Pump Bunny.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>It sports an inflatable shaft that can be enlarged by up to 15mm in diameter at the touch of a button, producing a “filling” sensation that some find mind-blowing. This could be just the ticket if your orgasm is intensified by the presence of a girthy internal toy, giving your vaginal muscles something to clench around as the waves of climax hit (more common than is discussed), especially if you need to build up to having something wide inside you. Magnetic charging, smart buttons and a walloping 15-year warranty show this toy is more than just hot air.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>it makes a noise like a car tyre inflator while it’s pumping up, and sounds like your vagina is sighing mournfully as it deflates. Put the stereo on, because this toy’s noises make for an inappropriate and distressing lovemaking soundtrack.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> five<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> one hour <br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two hours and 30 minutes<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>15 years</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>sustainable </strong></em><em><strong>rabbit:</strong></em> <strong><br></strong><strong>Natural Love Company Senna</strong><strong> </strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.thenaturallovecompany.com/eco-friendly-sex-toys/vibrators/thrusting-vibrators/senna/\"><sub>£94.95 at the Natural Love Company</sub></a></p> <p>In the past, eco-friendly toys have been well-intentioned yet disappointingly ineffectual, and with an unattractively hippy vibe. There was a wind-up vibrator that required eight minutes of hand-cranking and looked like something you’d find in an army medical tent, and a solar-powered bullet that had to stay attached to its charging panel to work. But now the Natural Love Company is making beautiful, talented toys, with eco credentials, including the incorporation of reclaimed ocean plastics and carbon-neutral delivery.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>I was intrigued to check out the Senna after being impressed by <a href=\"https://www.thenaturallovecompany.com/eco-friendly-sex-toys/vibrators/thrusting-vibrators/yarrow/\">the Yarrow</a>: a willow-green rabbit with a thrusting head that’s far more graceful-looking than this kind of gadget has any right to be. The Senna’s undulating shaft mimics a “come hither” motion, with swirling beads beneath a buttery-soft silicone covering, while the rabbit ears have been swapped for a little pulsating bean. It’s another winner that’ll give your knees the hippy shakes.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the crevices around the clitoral stimulating nub need extra attention to keep clean and bacteria-free between uses.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> three<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run</strong><strong> time:</strong> one hour <br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two hours<strong><br></strong><strong>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>one year</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best </strong></em><em><strong>new</strong></em><em><strong> animal:</strong></em> <strong><br>Snail Vibe Curve</strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/snail-vibe-curve-black-rabbit-vibrator-10351544\"><sub>£97.74 at Boots</sub></a><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/sex-toys/vibrators/rabbit-vibrators/p/snail-vibe-curve-rechargeable-extra-powerful-dual-vibrator/a48942g86896.html\"><sub>£119.99 at Love Honey</sub></a></p> <p>A new animal enters the scene, with an ingenious take on how to tackle those pesky rabbit problems. Instead of bunny ears, the Snail Vibe Curve has a vibrating spiral “shell” that rests externally on the clitoris. As you insert the internal shaft, this shell unrolls to maintain constant clitoral contact – check out the videos on <a href=\"https://www.snail-vibe.com/\">Snail Vibe’s website</a> to see what I mean. You can enjoy penetration that’s as shallow or deep as you wish or thrust the toy back and forth, without the clitoral stimulator slipping out of place.</p> <p>The Snail has received a glow-up for its Curve edition, with a ribbed texture applied to the shell; magnetic charging; and most usefully, the addition of a looped handle for easier handling. It has two pleasingly throbby motors on the shell and shaft, which can be independently controlled to fine-tune your experience, inside and out. It takes a while to find your way around a toy this curious, but the payoff is worthwhile. </p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the buttons are a fraction fiddly, and don’t think about trombones during use or you won’t be able to stop laughing.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> five for each motor<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> five for each motor<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> one hour <br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two hours<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>two years</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best budget rabbit:</strong></em> <br><strong>Bondara </strong><strong>Screwball </strong><strong>Mon </strong><strong>Amour </strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.bondara.co.uk/bondara-marble-effect-16-function-rechargeable-rabbit-vibtrator\"><sub>£45.99 at Bondara</sub></a></p> <p>An aesthetic homage to the popular <a href=\"https://www.lelo.com/soraya-2\">Lelo Soraya 2</a> that costs significantly less.

The hoop handle is intended for users to loop their fingers through, so their thumb rests naturally on the controls, but you could also thread silky bondage rope through it for … reasons.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>Bondara recommends that the Screwball isn’t left plugged in for more than four hours, to avoid impairing the battery over time. That’s a pest if you want to charge overnight (or while you’re at work).

And speaking of your hopefully thick walls, you don’t get 3,000-9,000 revs a minute of power without noise, so be aware this is loud enough to sound like you need a licence to drive it.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Doxy makes a <a href=\"https://www.boots.com/doxy-die-cast-3-rechargeablematte-black-massager-10330446\">rechargeable Die Cast</a> (£149.99) and several superb <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doxy-Go-Rechargeable-Vibrator-Waterproof/dp/B0DT9YT8CR\">smaller, lighter cordless wands</a>, too. However, I’m recommending the plug-in version because its formidable power never stops. It has a three-metre lead, so it stretches most places you want it to go – if you’re already considering a toy the size of a rounders bat, portability probably isn’t a big concern. I’ve had a version for a decade and a half, and it’s still impeccable.</p> <p>Nothing about the Die Cast is subtle, but I’d argue that the push for sex toys to be “discreet” has roots in shame. Multiple women who’ve sought my advice for anorgasmia have called me, ecstatic, after my Doxy tipoff has tipped them over into their first ever climax: something unabashed that works is better than something understated that doesn’t. Invest in the customisable By You edition, and get ready to rumble.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>at 690g, it’s heavy as hell. People without strong wrists or with problems like arthritis should explore wand-positioning cushions, such as those by <a href=\"https://www.sinful.co.uk/p/liberator-bonbon-toy-mount-sex-pillow/1016996\">Liberator</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/bondage/sex-swings-machines/sex-furniture-position-enhancers/p/sportsheets-pivot-convertible-toy-mount-cushion/a49366g87377.html\">Sportsheets</a>.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> continuous progression<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> variable escalating pulse mode<br><strong>Power:</strong> mains-powered<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> no<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> two years</p> <p>***</p> <p><em><strong>Best classy all-rounder:</strong></em> <strong><br></strong><strong>L</strong><strong>elo Smart Wand 2 </strong></p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.lelo.com/smart-wand-2-large\"><sub>£137.83 at Lelo</sub></a><strong><br></strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/LELO-All-Over-Handheld-Massager-Vibration/dp/B085GH9YWB\"><sub>From £134.30 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>Lelo is the Idris Elba of the adult toy arena:<strong> </strong>chic, almost universally considered attractive, and a reliably fantastic performer.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>This ergonomic delight is easy to wield and functions excellently as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/24/best-massage-guns\">massage gun</a> in addition to its racier applications.

It would have been my top pick were it not for the fact that I’m confident the Doxy could get an orgasm out of a cabbage.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the large Lelo wand will intimidate some folks: for some reason its curved rhino-horn shape makes it seem even heftier than a straight wand.

However, it’s a great entry-level wand that gives you a chance to experiment with different stimulation styles and learn what you like before investing in a deluxe toy for three times the price.</p> <p><strong>Speeds:</strong> three<br><strong>Vibe patterns:</strong> seven<br><strong>Power:</strong> rechargeable<br><strong>Run time:</strong> one hour<br><strong>Charge time: </strong>two hours and 30 minutes<strong><br>Waterproof:</strong> yes<br><strong>Warranty:</strong> two years</p> <p>***</p> <h2>How I chose vibrators – and what you should consider</h2>    <p>***</p> <p>At least 15 toys were tested in each category, with 53 tested in total. In addition to his links to love and lust, Saint Valentine is also the patron saint of beekeeping, so he would feel quite at home amid the cacophony of buzzing that soundtracked the production of this article.</p> <p>I discounted any products not made from body-safe materials, such as porous jellies that can harbour bacteria and dirt, or plastics containing phthalates, which have been linked to cancer and hormonal interference. I considered things such as whether each device lived up to the claims made by its manufacturer; how easy it was to position and control; how fast it charged and how long the battery lasted, where relevant; and how attractive, adaptable, powerful and comfortable it was.</p> <p>What I <em>didn’t </em>do was automatically label a toy as a “holy grail” or an “almighty fail” if it didn’t happen to float my idiosyncratic boat, or provide what I personally need to reach orgasm, through no inherent fault of its own. Deciding upon the “best” vibrator is highly subjective, so I’ve tried to explain how different items might suit different folks.</p> <p>When making your own considerations, useful questions to ask include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Do I prefer gentle or potent vibrations (or both)? What styles of touch delight me, and do I want external or internal stimulation (or both)?</p></li> <li><p>What shape and size of toy will suit my body and my tastes?</p></li> <li><p>Do I want something simple, straightforward and intuitive, or experimental/multifunctional/tech-enabled?</p></li> <li><p>What materials and textures feel inviting to me?</p></li> </ul> <p>A note on volume: some reviews rate toys on how quiet they are, but I’ve NEVER met a vibe that’s as near-silent as it says it is. For that reason, I’ve only pointed out when a toy is notably loud enough to sound like you’ve rented it from a builders’ merchant.</p> <p>In almost all cases, you do have to put your hand in your pocket if you want the best. Strong motors, neat details and high-performance designs don’t tend to come cheap. I believe pleasure should be accessible to all, though, so there’s at least one budget option included in each category. It’ll have some compromises, but it should give you plenty of “Ooh!” for not much dough.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Can vibrators decrease your sensitivity?</h2> <p>Let me reassure you: using vibrators will not cause nerve damage to your genitals. However, if, over a prolonged period, you <em>always </em>reach for a toy when masturbating – particularly if it’s a high-strength model like a mains-powered wand – you may inadvertently condition your body to become used to intense stimulation. Much like a curry fan who’s been mainlining vindaloo and is then served a masala, the comparatively gentle feelings provided by fingers or partners may begin to feel less spicy, and you may struggle to orgasm without the potent or pinpointed vibrations with which you’ve become familiar.</p> <p>A similar problem arises for people with penises who hold themselves very tightly and use rough motions during solo play. American sex educator Dan Savage nicknamed this “the death grip”, and it can cause erectile dysfunction and difficulties ejaculating via the relative tenderness of intercourse.</p> <p>Luckily, solutions are simple. First: chill out on your vibrator use, to give your body time to reappraise the delights of the delicate. You may want to try a period of abstinence, where you return to manual masturbation without grabbing a toy. Or if you’ve been cranking your toy’s power straight up to 11, try being a little less Spın̈al Tap and experimenting with softer speeds and patterns. Lubricant can help too, by cushioning sensitive tissues a little.</p> <p>If you find that sex without toys simply doesn’t feel as good, another option is to involve your toys in sex. Contrary to many people’s fears, vibrators can’t replace the profound intimacy and thrill of being with another human being, but they can vastly <em>enhance</em> shared experiences – they’re complementary co-pilots, not competitors.</p> <p>If you’re someone who feels threatened by toys, it may help to think of them as specialist equipment. You wouldn’t feel emasculated or belittled if you had to equip yourself with an axe to cut down a tree instead of just using your bare hands, right? Instead, it’s more impressive to learn to wield that equipment like a pro, whether you want to chop timber or set your partner’s night alight. Using the right apparatus the right way is the fastest route to successfully starting a fire. Ask your lover to show you how they like the toy to be positioned, and be eager to take on any feedback they give.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>What to do when your old toys finally die</h2> <p>If all this toy talk has reminded you that you have enough bad vibes, shot bullets and dead rabbits gathering dust in your bedside cabinet to rival Watership Down, you’re not alone. Research conducted earlier this year by tech refurbishment specialists Back Market revealed that 15% of people keep old and broken sex toys stored ad infinitum because they’re embarrassed to throw them away. One in three surreptitiously chuck them in the household bin – even though anything with batteries, a plug or a charging port can be recycled. An unfortunate side-effect of increased sexual liberation and toy ownership is that worn-out erotic electricals are worsening the planet’s burgeoning e-waste problem, and valuable materials within them, including aluminium, gold, copper, lithium and steel, are being lost to landfill.</p> <p>If your ancient wand vibe is now more tragic than magic, head to <a href=\"https://www.recycleyourelectricals.org.uk/electrical-recycling-near-me/\">Recycle Your Electricals</a>, enter your postcode, then select Vibrator from the dropdown menu (yes, it’s a legitimate category). You’ll be given recycling instructions specific to your location; some councils will even collect your raunchy rubbish direct from your door. I’d wrap it in a bag, mind, for discretion. The binman doesn’t need to have the dirt on <em>all </em>your filth.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Alix Fox is an award-winning writer and broadcaster specialising in sexual wellbeing and culture, with 20 years of experience in receiving dick pics sent not to titillate, but because the worried texter wants an informed opinion on a weird lump/rash/wart.

The intimidation included threats to blow up his car and Islamophobic voicemails left at Mamdani’s office in the city’s Queens borough.</p>    <p>“The violent and specific language of what appears to be a repeat caller is alarming and we are taking every precaution,” his campaign said Thursday, blaming the threats on “dehumanizing, Islamophobic rhetoric designed to stoke division and hate”.</p> <p>Miller contacted the US Capitol Police after being “run off the road” by a man displaying a Palestinian flag who allegedly yelled “death to Israel”. Miller, who is Jewish and on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/12/jewish-republican-trump-haitian-immigrants-holocaust\">US Holocaust Memorial Council</a>, said the incident occurred while driving in his congressional district and that he knows the identity of his alleged assailant, who also threatened to kill his family.</p> <p>Early on Friday afternoon, a man was arrested in connection with the incident.</p> <p>The suspect was named as Feras Hamdan, 36, of Westlake, near Cleveland, and authorities said he turned himself in to police and is due to appear in court, <a href=\"https://www.cleveland19.com/2025/06/20/westlake-man-charged-road-rage-incident-with-congressman-max-miller/\">according to</a> local media reports.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Memphis police arrested 25-year-old Trenton Abston on charges including stalking and attempted kidnapping after he allegedly scaled a wall at Young’s residence in Tennessee with what police described as a “nervous demeanor”. Officers recovered “a taser, gloves, rope and duct tape” from the suspect’s vehicle.</p>    <p>The string of incidents came just days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-misinformation-rightwing\">after the killing</a> of Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota Democratic state representative, and her husband Mark, with John Hoffman, a state senator, and his wife seriously wounded in a separate attack by the same gunman last Saturday as anti-Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/no-kings-protests\">“No Kings” protests</a> were getting underway <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade\">for millions</a> across the country. The suspect, Vance Boelter, 57, was captured after a large manhunt and faces murder charges, amid reports that he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-misinformation-rightwing\">an extremist</a> and was pro-Trump and anti-abortion.</p> <p>The discovery of a hit list containing “dozens and dozens” of Democratic politicians’ names in Boelter’s car has sent new shockwaves through the political community. Hillary Scholten, a member of Congress from Michigan, cancelled a public town hall, citing safety concerns.</p> <p>The escalating threats have left congressmembers from both parties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/congress-security-minnesota-shooting\">demanding additional security funding</a> and enhanced protection measures in recent days, as fears grow that political violence is becoming normalized across American politics. The Capitol Police requested nearly $1bn in funding for next year, while Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, posted that “the violence and threats against elected officials has drastically increased” and called for more money to protect lawmakers.</p> <p>Capitol Police <a href=\"https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2024\">investigated 9,474 threats</a> to lawmakers and their families last year, an increase of nearly 1,500 compared with 2023, which have escalated over the last five years but peaked in 2021. Only <a href=\"https://democrats-cha.house.gov/media/press-releases/chairman-steil-and-ranking-member-morelle-request-doj-assistance-threats\">eight convictions were made</a> over the threats in 2024, according to a bipartisan letter from Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin representative, and Joseph Morelle, a New York representative, sent Tuesday to the Department of Justice.</p> <p>Mike Johnson linked the violence to broader political rhetoric. “What happened to Max [Miller] this morning is yet another outrageous example of unhinged rhetoric inspiring unstable people to threaten and attack elected officials,” the House speaker said. “We must turn down the temperature in this country.”<br></p>",

India are seeking a first series win in England since 2007, having been held to a 2-2 draw last time out, a garland their new red-ball skipper, Shubman Gill, ranks higher than going all the way in the Indian Premier League. “You don’t get many opportunities as a captain to be able to come to England and you get to have a crack at the IPL every year,” says one of the IPL’s poster boys and a title winner with Gujarat Giants in 2022. “In my opinion winning a Test series in England, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa is bigger.” <strong>Ali Martin</strong>, <strong>Andy Bull</strong> and <strong>Simon Burnton</strong> are our reporting team at Headingley.</p> <p>11am</p> <p>Royal Ascot live</p> <p>Racing</p>  <p>“It’s the biggest five days in our sport – our shop window,” says the leading jockey William Buick of the glittering five days of Royal Ascot. The Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Stakes (3.40pm) is the highlight of the sun-baked meeting’s final day. Kevin Ryan’s Inisherin was a brilliant winner of the Commonwealth Cup over the course and distance 12 months ago, while the French raider Lazzat won his first six starts for Jérôme Reynier and, having bolted up back over six furlongs at Chantilly, has been snapped up by the powerful Wathnan Racing operation.

Carlos Alcara, the top seed and 2023 winner, endured three hours and 23 energy-sapping minutes in beating his Spanish compatriot Jaume Munar on Thursday. The match may have been two hours shorter than his five-set French Open final win over Jannik Sinner earlier this month but the five-time grand slam champion suffered as temperatures soared to 32C. After a 15th straight win, the longest winning run of his career, a near-exhausted Alcaraz said: “It was a really tough battle.” <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong> has all the action covered.</p> <p>3.15pm</p> <p>England XV v France XV </p> <p>Rugby union</p>  <p>An unfamiliar England face France for Saturday’s non-cap international. There are five uncapped names in Steve Borthwick’s makeshift squad, with three set to start, as call-ups to Andy Farrell’s British &amp; Irish Lions have have given the head coach the chance to experiment. The late addition of Jack van Poortvliet to the Lions party means there will be 14 players unavailable when England run out for the final time before the summer tour to Argentina and the United States. <strong>Michael Aylwin</strong> reports from Twickenham.</p> <p>8pm</p> <p>Spain v England, U-21s Euros live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>The European Under-21 Championship 2023 winners face a rematch with Spain, whom they defeated to lift the trophy two years ago. But Lee Carsley’s side approach the quarter-final in patchy form having followed up last Sunday’s goalless draw with Slovenia with a disappointing 2-1 loss against Germany to round off the group stage. Slovenia’s defeat by the Czech Republic in the other final match in the group was enough to secure Carsley’s side passage to the last-eight tie in Trnava, Slovakia.&nbsp;<strong>Will Unwin</strong> keeps the updates flowing while <strong>Ed Aarons</strong> reports.</p>   <p>8pm</p> <p>Jonathan Wilson</p> <p>Inside football</p>  <p>Our columnist considers the cult of personality at the revamped Club World Cup – how the individual walk-ons at the start of matches offer further proof, if any were needed, that Fifa is failing to understand that football remains a team sport – just ask Paris Saint-Germain, who unlocked European success by ditching their superstars.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>11am</p> <p>England v India live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p><strong>Rob Smyth</strong> and <strong>Taha Hashim</strong> take up the over-by-over baton on day three at Headingley. Win against India in the coming weeks, then reclaim the Ashes in Australia, and Ben Stokes would go down as one of his country’s greatest skippers, but he is not ready to think in those terms. “There’s always a different buzz coming up against India and Australia in particular, purely because of how big those series are,” he says. “Away from the dressing room, we know what these series mean compared to other ones. But defining a career as England captain isn’t something that I really think about. If that’s what I’m really bothered about, it’s just completely and utterly selfish and that ain’t me.”</p> <p>11am</p> <p>County Championship live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p><strong>Tanya Aldred</strong> helms our rolling blog and will no doubt be keeping a weather eye on Jofra Archer’s exploits for Sussex against Durham. England’s paceman has been beset by a litany of injury problems and played the last of his 13 Tests in February 2021. It is hoped he will make his first-class return, part of a plan that could lead to him being restored to Ben Stokes’s squad at some point during a five-match series against India. There has been an understandable sense of caution about Archer’s latest rehabilitation, which was further delayed by a broken thumb, but the bowler himself has made his own intentions clear – at one stage floating a hurried return in last month’s one-off Test against Zimbabwe.</p>   <p>1am Monday</p> <p>Game 7 title-decider live</p> <p>NBA finals</p>  <p>The Indiana Pacers stormed to a 108-91 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday to level the NBA finals at three games apiece and set up a decisive game 7 in Oklahoma City in the early hours on Monday. <strong>David Lengel</strong> will be across all of the action with his live blog on the biggest night in the basketball season.</p> <p>2am Monday</p> <p>Manchester City v Al Ain live</p> <p>Club World Cup</p>  <p>In the small hours, our live coverage of the tournament continues at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta as the holders face Emirati opposition.

            "body" : "<p>When Kim Leadbeater walked out of the chamber of the House of Commons into parliament’s central lobby, she was embraced by some campaigners who did not even know if they would be alive when the vote came.</p> \n<p>“Overwhelmingly the sense is relief,” she said. Her close colleague the Labour MP Lizzi Collinge was near to tears. For the Conservative Kit Malthouse, standing nearby, it was the culmination of a decade of campaigning within his own party. More than 20 of his colleagues – more than he expected – backed the bill.</p> \n<p>But even in the voting lobbies MPs were texting each other with doubts the bill would pass, so high was the tension on both sides. When the speaker read out the numbers, Keir Starmer, a longtime supporter who has tried to stay studiously neutral, allowed himself a small smile. Some opponents, many of them veteran Labour female MPs, looked deeply shaken.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/20/britain-assisted-dying-vote-kim-leadbeater-labour-mp\">Britain is one step closer to compassionate, kind death for all | Kim Leadbeater</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Leadbeater, the vote came at a difficult time. Sunday would have been her sister Jo Cox’s birthday, and last Monday was the ninth anniversary of the MP’s murder.</p> \n<p>In the six months since the bill was first voted on, opposition has grown more vocal. Leadbeater felt it personally when MPs who she hoped would support her have moved against the bill. And the attacks, particularly on social media, have become more personal.</p> \n<p>When she voted, Leadbeater said she would think about a lay preacher with terminal cancer she met in Yorkshire – Pamela – who spoke of how she believed that the God of her own faith did not want suffering prolonged.</p> \n<p>“I’m fully respectful of everybody’s views when it comes to their personal faith,” Leadbeater said in her office, speaking to the Guardian on the evening before the vote. “But the way she spoke about her religion and how that has informed her thoughts as a dying woman, I thought was very, very powerful.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fa171f54-524a-446d-a1f1-a053777b8d16\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KFdCwHldfBA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Leadbeater hopes the bill will get its royal assent by October, but that will be the beginning of a four-year process to implement it, overseen by Whitehall officials. Many questions remain: how it will be funded, whether the NHS will oversee it or private providers and whether it will be free at the point of use.</p> \n<p>It will be implemented by the Department of Health and Social Care, although Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has told allies he will not seek to impede it. The day-to-day work will be handed over to the care minister, Stephen Kinnock, who backed it.</p> \n<p>And there remain some assisted dying supporters in parliament who feel the bill is a missed opportunity, especially for those with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s who will not be eligible.</p> \n<p>In the public gallery on Friday, there were rows of campaigners, many of them in tears, with one clasping their hands in prayer. There have been deep bonds formed within both sides in parliament, Leadbeater was surrounded by supporters on the party’s left and right, from Jake Richards to John McDonnell.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/jun/20/how-did-your-mp-vote-on-the-assisted-dying-bill\">How did your MP vote on the assisted dying bill?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In front of her were some of the bill’s most active and thoughtful opponents, a group of female Labour MPs new to parliament, Jess Asato, Polly Billington and Melanie Ward. Those women each had deeply personal reasons for their opposition, such as having long careers fighting for vulnerable women and disabled people.</p> \n<p>Almost all of those who spoke – for and against – talked about some of the hardest moments of their lives, deaths of parents from pancreatic cancer, a sister with brain cancer, friends dying too young.</p> \n<p>Some supporters of the bill said they wished at times Leadbeater had taken a harder line. “Kim has tried to be too constructive with people – you can’t negotiate or work with people whose sole intent is to kill the bill. And that’s what’s frustrating, because whatever you give them, give them an inch and they take a mile,” one MP said.</p> \n<p>There is still<strong> </strong>deep unease among advisers in No 10 about the bill’s passing and, until the 11th hour, there was a live discussion over whether Starmer would abstain on the vote, especially given the Iran situation.</p> \n<p>But, as some staffers acknowledge, it would have had echoes of Boris Johnson heading to Afghanistan to avoid a vote on Heathrow. The public, whatever the PM says about neutrality, will assume this is a Labour government endeavour. “Perhaps there is a lesson here about not promising parliamentary time to Esther Rantzen,” one quipped.</p> \n<p>The prime minister himself had been deeply conscious of not wanting to appear to influence MPs. He had personally admonished Streeting for doing so before the last vote. But his very presence in the yes lobbies would always be a factor for some.</p> \n<p>For some MPs, there is a feeling now that the government should take ownership of the issue, as David Cameron did on equal marriage. “Why not try and take credit for something good? A lot of people really like it,” one MP said.</p> \n<p>For the most passionate, the issue has dominated the last few months in parliament. But they are in the minority. For others, it was in the week of the final vote that they began to turn their minds to whether the agreed-upon safeguards were robust enough.</p> \n<p>The message from opponents was that it was no longer a vote on the principle, but on the detail. “For some of us, this has been our lives for the last six months,” one senior MP said. “For some colleagues, they just haven’t thought about it at all and didn’t engage back until this week. How do they really feel about being responsible for wrong or compelled deaths? That was the question put to them.”</p> \n<p>Other opponents of the bill raised concerns about the highly imperfect nature of a private member’s bill, starting a bill from scratch with no heft of a Whitehall department or legislative experts.</p> \n<p>“It’s been a shocking indictment of our process generally, MPs are suddenly realising that,” said one. Leadbeater has argued to MPs that the bill has had exactly the same level of expertise and input from civil servants as any other.</p> \n<p>Significant practical changes have been made to the bill since November, including the removal of approval being needed from a high court judge.</p> \n<p>That was taken out on the demand of the Ministry of Justice, fearful of how it could gum up the courts even further. Now the process will include a panel of psychiatrist, social worker and senior lawyer.</p> \n<p>That has been met with concern among some of those professions too. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it feared clinicians could be tied up with those decisions, rather than helping patients navigate their depression, which might enable them to recover enough to want to live longer.</p> \n<p>For some these concerns were crucial to changing their votes. The Labour MP Josh Fenton-Glynn, who previously abstained, said the safeguards were not strong enough. He said: “I don’t legislate for me, I legislate for everyone including those with complex disabilities.”</p> \n<p>Dr Simon Opher, another Labour MP, said it was clear there would be people for whom the safeguards would not be robust enough.</p> \n<p>“What I realised in the process was that no matter how many safeguards were put in place, almost everyone who was against the bill were steadfast in their views.</p> \n<p>For many new MPs, being part of such a defining moment of social change so early in their parliamentary careers has been intense. “It’s been an incredibly emotional and at times overwhelming process to be part of, especially as a new MP,” the Lib Dem MP Tom Gordon said.</p> \n<p>The issue has dominated their postbags. But since November, most who spoke to the Guardian have noticed a concerted increase in those who were against the bill.</p> \n<p>“It’s one of the first issues in my life where I have actually seen signed petitions on paper – people who have gone door to door or passed it round a church group,” one MP said.</p> \n<p>In the final hours before the vote, opponents thought they were getting closer. A campaigner even offered to fund a private ambulance for the Alliance MP Sorcha Eastwood, an opponent of the bill, who had Covid and feared she would miss the vote – though she eventually tested negative. But though the majority has been slashed, it is still substantial enough to mean peers are unlikely block its progress.</p> \n<p>The bill will now pass to the House of Lords where it is expected to be shepherded by the Labour peer Charlie Falconer. But it is a process that is still very unpredictable.</p> \n<p>“I thought the spreadsheet for us was hard,” one MP backing the bill said. “That is a different level – will they turn up? Do we even know who they are?”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The BBC has scrapped plans to show a documentary about medics in Gaza after concluding it “risked creating a perception of partiality” over the corporation’s coverage of the conflict.</p> <p>In the latest controversy over the BBC’s coverage of the war, it announced that discussions over how to broadcast the film, or incorporate some of its footage into its news coverage, had “reached the end of the road”. It said it was now transferring ownership of the project to the independent production company that produced it.</p> <p>Anger and frustration had been building for months over the status of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, with some involved in the film believing it was originally due to be broadcast at the start of the year. There have been concerns that some of those featured in the programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/22/doctors-and-whistleblowers-in-delayed-gaza-film-threaten-to-pull-out\">could withdraw their support</a> over the delays.</p> <p>The BBC formally paused its broadcast after an investigation was launched into the making of another documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone. That programme was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/21/bbc-pulls-gaza-documentary-iplayer-hamas\">pulled from iPlayer earlier this year after</a> it emerged that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. The review into its production continues.</p> <p>However, the BBC said that after attempting to find other ways of using parts of the medics programme, produced by the independent Basement Films, it had concluded there were impartiality concerns and it would no longer be shown by the broadcaster.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/may/12/susan-sarandon-among-hundreds-to-urge-bbc-to-release-delayed-gaza-film\">Susan Sarandon among hundreds to urge BBC to release delayed Gaza film</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We wanted the doctors’ voices to be heard,” the BBC said in a statement. “Our aim was to find a way to air some of the material in our news programmes, in line with our impartiality standards, before the review was published. For some weeks, the BBC has been working with Basement Films to find a way to tell the stories of these doctors on our platforms.”</p> <p>It added: “Yesterday it became apparent that we have reached the end of the road with these discussions. We have come to the conclusion that broadcasting this material risked creating a perception of partiality that would not meet the high standards that the public rightly expect of the BBC. Impartiality is a core principle of BBC News. It is one of the reasons that we are the world’s most trusted broadcaster.”</p> <p>It also challenged claims the film had ever undergone the BBC’s final pre-broadcast signoff processes. “Any film broadcast will not be a BBC film,” it said.</p> <p>The decision comes after the founder of Basement Films, Ben de Pear, took aim at the BBC during a documentary festival this week, saying BBC journalists were being “stymied and silenced”. He directly criticised the BBC director general, Tim Davie, whom he described as “a PR person”.</p> <p>“All the decisions about our film were not taken by journalists; they were taken by Tim Davie,” he said. “Tim Davie is taking editorial decisions which, frankly, he is not capable of making.</p> <p>“The BBC’s primary purpose is TV news and current affairs, and if it’s failing on that, it doesn’t matter what drama it makes or sports it covers. It is failing as an institution. And if it’s failing on that, then it needs new management.”</p> <p>The decision also follows an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme by one of the journalists involved in the documentary, Ramita Navai, in which she described Israel as “a rogue state that’s committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing, and mass-murdering Palestinians”.</p> <p>Challenged about her statement by the presenter Amol Rajan, who said that it was her opinion, she said it “isn’t my opinion” and that she had collected evidence during her work on the documentary.</p> <p>The BBC said it had produced “powerful coverage” of the Gaza war, including documentaries. “We have also investigated allegations of abuse of Palestinian prisoners and Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s hospitals,” it said. “We want to thank the doctors and contributors and we are sorry we could not tell their stories. The BBC will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>We’ve mulled over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/apr/25/how-25-years-of-music-has-shaped-the-charts-from-monoculture-to-mass-playlists\">music</a>, tackled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/may/23/the-guide-reality-tv-streaming-tv-pop-culture\">TV</a> and now, to finish our series looking at how pop culture has changed in the first quarter of the 21st century, we’re chewing over cinema.</p> <p>And there’s quite a bit of chewing to do, equivalent to at least a medium-rare steak or a large toffee. Because, while film might not have been disturbed quite as dramatically by streaming as music or TV has, its still had to contend with some serious changes in audience habits. The more than a century-old practice of spending money to stare at a giant screen in a darkened room now has all manner of competition, including streamers like Netflix beaming films with the same production values and star names straight to your living room at a fraction of the price.</p> <p>These changing headwinds, not to mention a global pandemic that discouraged people from gathering in enclosed spaces together, have only intensified a focus on what studios believe will coax people into cinemas: superhero movies, sequels and stories drawn from familiar IP – wizards, hobbits, Barbies. All of these make an appearance in the list of the biggest films each year at the global box office, which we’ll be looking at today.</p> <p>To help make sense of how cinema has shifted over the past 25 years, I spoke to film journalist <em><strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></em>, who as well as being the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/screen-deep-9780571369423/\">Screen Deep</a>: How Film and TV can Solve Racism and Save the World, co-hosts Radio 4’s film discussion series <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00121bv\">Screenshot</a> with Mark Kermode. Who better then to channel Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, and solve the complicated equations of 21st century cinema. Here’s the list of the highest-grossing films from each year in full and what it tells us …</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The full list</strong></p> <p><strong>2000</strong> | Mission: Impossible 2<br><strong>2001</strong> | Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone<br><strong>2002</strong> | The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers<br><strong>2003</strong> | The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King<br><strong>2004</strong> | Shrek 2<br><strong>2005</strong> | Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<br><strong>2006</strong> | Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest<br><strong>2007</strong> | Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End<br><strong>2008</strong> | The Dark Knight<br><strong>2009</strong> | Avatar<br><strong>2010</strong> | Toy Story 3<br><strong>2011</strong> | Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2<br><strong>2012</strong> | The Avengers<br><strong>2013</strong> | Frozen<br><strong>2014</strong> | Transformers: Age of Extinction<br><strong>2015</strong> | Star Wars: The Force Awakens<br><strong>2016</strong> | Captain America: Civil War<br><strong>2017</strong> | Star Wars: The Last Jedi<br><strong>2018</strong> | Avengers: Infinity War<br><strong>2019</strong> | Avengers: Endgame<br><strong>2020</strong> | Demon Slayer: Mugen Train<br><strong>2021</strong> | Spider-Man: No Way Home<br><strong>2022</strong> | Avatar: The Way of Water<br><strong>2023</strong> | Barbie<br><strong>2024</strong> | Inside Out 2</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Blockbusters reign supreme</strong></p>    <p>Fifty years to the day since the release of Jaws, the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/20/jaws-movie-hollywood\">blockbuster</a>, now there is seemingly nothing but. And, while Jaws was based on an original idea, today’s equivalents trade on past glories. “Hollywood,” Ellen says, “is becoming increasingly risk-averse, leading to an ever-narrowing offering at the multiplex.”</p> <p>As Ellen points out, in the last 25 years of the 20th century only eight of the highest-grossing films from each year were sequels and franchises (though some would go on to spawn their own sequels). “But in this century, with the exception of Frozen, every single highest-grossing film has been based off of a popular toy, book or film series, and frequently all three.”</p> <p>Amid this sea of regurgitated IP, Ellen sees one small glint of optimism: Barbie, despite the fact Greta Gerwig’s film was drawn from the most commercial of sources. “The film is unassailable proof that, even within the strict IP-only, risk-averse confines of the current system, a film-maker and star, working in perfect partnership and at the height of their powers, can make great cinema art,” Ellen says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Stars are less important than ever</strong></p> <p>In the 21st century it is the franchise, not the human fronting it, that determines box office success. “Gone are the days when all your movie needed was Julia Roberts’s smile or Bruce Willis in a tank top and you were guaranteed return on investment,” says Ellen. “These days, every actor needs a franchise under their belt in order to crack the highest-earning list, and preferably that franchise is the Marvel Cinematic Universe.”</p> <p>Still, wonders Ellen, is the dwindling importance of A-listers at the box office necessarily a bad thing? “From the star’s ashes has risen a new category of Interesting Internet-Beloved Actors: people like Josh O’Connor, Paul Mescal, Anya Taylor-Joy and Zendaya, who now have space to carve artistically fulfilling careers on their own terms … just as long as they don’t expect to out-earn Robert Downey Jr in 2013.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>… and so are the Oscars</strong></p>    <p>Oscar acclaim and commercial success have rarely been bedfellows, but in the 20th century you would find occasional meeting of the two (The Godfather, Rocky or Titanic, for example). In the last 25 years though the prospect of an Oscar-winning chart topper seems fanciful: only one film on our list – The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King – has won best picture and few others have even been nominated. Still, says Ellen, the Oscars still have a role to play here.</p> <p>“If the Academy awards is good for anything — and I have my doubts — it’s giving a box office bump to quality films for grownups that might otherwise get overlooked, in this time of superhero shenanigans aimed at 15-year-old boys. There are many people who will go and see great films like The Zone of Interest, Past Lives or Nickel Boys simply because they are Oscar nominated. That said, there is only ever a fairly loose correlation between awards season success and artistic value, so I don’t find this divergence unduly concerning.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Cinema is thriving away from the top of the box office</strong></p> <p>Rather than uninspired blockbusters, Ellen is interested in what <em>isn’t</em> on this list. The fact that our 25 films are only representative of what people went to the cinema to see, misses an entire revolution in film-making that streaming has only accelerated. “Streaming and its preference for the subscriber revenue model has, in combination with campaigning pressure from social media, led to a positive development on screen, which would be missed if the highest-grossing list is your only barometer,” she says.</p> <p>The result has been a rapidly increasing diversity – in terms, says Ellen of “race, gender identity and, to a lesser extent, class” – in the sort of stories being told on screen. “More different kinds of films are being made with smaller budgets, aimed at representing smaller — but possibly more enthusiastically engaged — audience groups,” says Ellen. “And some of these have also been huge commercial successes, exploding the pervasive and pernicious industry myth that only white-fronted films can ‘open’ at the box office.” She points to the enormous success of Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther, or Crazy Rich Asians, the highest-grossing romcom of the entire 2010s.</p> <p>And then there are the many, many people going to see films each week that don’t ever threaten the top of the box office: indie movies, foreign language films or, increasingly, old films given a second chance on the big screen. “Thanks in part to platforms like Letterboxd, Mubi and even Instagram, a whole new generation of people now thinks going to the cinema to watch arthouse, left-field or foreign-language films is cool,” says Ellen. “If you don’t believe me, just head to the Prince Charles cinema in Leicester Square — or your local repertory or arthouse cinema — on a Friday or Saturday night. 75% of the audience are under 30.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What sums up 21st-century cinema?</strong></p> <p>So which film on our list best encapsulates film in the past quarter century? Given their dominance over our list, it would be difficult to look past one of the caped crusaders here, and Ellen opts for Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, which she describes as, “a superhero movie, but a superior one. It’s representative of our era’s tedious obsession with IP and that conservative affirmation of white, male, moral power represented by the (white, male) superhero, but it also demonstrates that there is some room for originality and artistry within that.”</p> <p>Superhero movies: not <em>entirely</em> terrible, then.</p> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/sep/14/guide-signup\">please subscribe</a> to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday</em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>If Marcia Lewis has learned anything in the past seven years, it is to keep pushing. “They probably thought by now I’d have disappeared,” the mother of the Arsenal and England left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly says with a laugh. “But I’m not that kind of girl. If I want to do something, I’m going to do it.”</p> <p>In March Lewis-Skelly, at the age of 18, became the youngest player to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/21/england-albania-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">score on his England debut</a>, and life has changed considerably for Lewis since she received a call from an agent who wanted to represent her son when he was 11.</p> <p>Lewis-Skelly had recently excelled at a youth tournament in Japan, along with Ethan Nwaneri, another Hale End academy product who has progressed into the first team under Mikel Arteta, and suddenly found himself in demand.</p> <p>“That’s when you start to know about the industry so that you can say: ‘Hang on, we’re not there yet. Let me find out more …,” Lewis says. “Because there is no race. There is no rush. My mum always used to say to me: ‘If something feels urgent, that is a sign to slow down.’”</p> <p>Lewis, who had experience of working for an investment bank in the City, took matters into her own hands. She qualified as a Fifa-registered agent and completed a master’s degree in football business, focusing her thesis on the parent experience in elite football academies – an area in which she was quickly gaining first-hand experience. “It can be a really lonely journey,” she says.</p>    <p>That proved to be the inspiration for setting up, in 2022, <a href=\"https://no1fan.club/\">No1Fan.club</a>, which has been providing support and education for parents of children in the academy systems and is due to become part of the Premier League’s life skills programme next season.</p> <p>“We’re only one of two organisations that do things specifically for parents,” she says proudly. “Everyone else is providing workshops for the players. But no one’s actually focusing on the parent support that helps the kids. So that’s a big win for us, that they finally realised that we’re here to help, and we’re not here to bash the industry but we are here to help them help parents with the realities of the journey, which inevitably will help them and their staff. It’s just taken them a while to realise that.”</p> <p>Lewis has also approached the Professional Footballers’ Association and wants to work with the Football Association on changing regulations that can restrict academy players from joining other clubs if they move home, with some effectively shut out if their former side demand compensation.</p> <p>“These are things which some parents have to seek legal advice for,” she says. “It’s tricky, but as grassroots parents that’s the last thing you’re even thinking about. It’s important that we help parents understand the journey. Signing the paper is the easy bit, but it’s what comes next: the expectation, the juggling of education, the messaging to our kids. The amount of people that say to me: ‘I bet you can retire because Myles is this.’ Or: ‘I bet you can buy a house.’ And I’m like, that’s the language that’s not helpful.”</p> <p>Lewis admits her son’s meteoric rise over the past season has been a steep learning curve but says a strong support network has helped to keep his feet very much on the ground. “Having to deal with going out in public, all of that is new,” she says.</p> <p>“I’m still learning. I think for us, the most important thing is having the right team around you, not putting him on a pedestal at home. ‘No, you’ve still got your chores to do. You still need to empty the dishwasher, tidy your room.’ He still lives at home and I like it, because obviously I enjoy his company a lot. But also, he’s a child – 18 does not make you an adult. It might do by the law. But he’s not ready to go out and live on his own.”</p>    <p>That were rumours of interest from Real Madrid this summer with Lewis-Skelly due to enter the final 12 months of his first professional contract, signed in October 2023, but he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/19/thomas-partey-rejects-arsenal-contract-extension-leaving-future-in-doubt\">poised to extend his deal</a> and become one of the world’s best-paid teenagers. Lewis expresses admiration for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/call-me-trent-alexander-arnold-arrives-at-madrid-with-dreams-of-alonso-and-glory\">level of Spanish</a> at his Madrid unveiling and says her son “loves” studying the language for his AS Level, but suggestions Lewis-Skelly might have left the club he joined at the age of eight are given short shrift.</p> <p>“Rumours are rumours, aren’t they?” Lewis says. “I mean, everyone would always have something to say, you know; that’s fine. We don’t engage in all of that. Myles is enjoying his football. I would want him to enjoy his football wherever he goes, at whatever stage. And, you know, that’s the most important thing.”</p> <p>Lewis acknowledges she is learning on the job when it comes to being an agent. “It’s not an easy thing to do and you have to have the right support. I am not walking this path alone. We have the right people to support Team Myles. And I think that’s the one thing that we would love to encourage parents to find out more.</p> <p>“We have a workshop called ‘Finding the right agent’. And it isn’t about, OK, go here. No, it’s about, do you know the role? The part that they’ll play? What questions should you ask? You know, even around the approach, around having a meeting, how do you show up to feel on an equal playing field with someone who wants to sell you a service? What are the signs? What are the red flags? Equally, parents, how do you need to adjust your behaviour? You know, it’s not about paying off your house.”</p> <p>The self-belief Lewis-Skelly showed in performing Erling Haaland’s Zen celebration after scoring in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/02/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal’s 5-1 thrashing of Manchester City</a> in February at the Emirates comes not only from his mother but also from Marcia’s mum. “She is a very confident woman – don’t take no shit!” Lewis says.</p>    <p>She is happy to take credit for her son’s physical prowess, which has impressed Arteta, Thomas Tuchel and so many pundits. “I’d like to say so!” she responds when asked whether her cooking is responsible. “Even as a young child he always ate well. As a kid, he always loved pasta. But it’s not like Myles has been on this nutritional health fix since he was 10. No, he’s been a child. Let him eat what he needs to eat.”</p> <p>No1Fan.club will host its first <a href=\"https://no1fan.club/events/the-parent-conference-changing-the-game-for-football-families/\">parent conference</a>, Changing the Game for Football Families, on 5 July at Stormzy’s Mercy HQ in south London. It will feature workshops from experts in areas such as career planning for young footballers and digital health, and talks from speakers including Les Smith, the father of Fulham’s Emile Smith Rowe. For Lewis, it is another opportunity to help break down some of the barriers in the sport.</p> <p>“I’ve witnessed some of the misogyny in football and how, from an agent perspective, I’ve been approached before, quite disrespectfully, quite frankly. Almost preyed upon … So I think that’s the other thing about having someone like myself, who is a Black woman, reaching parents, who finally feel that there is someone who either looks like them or is the same sex as them that is challenging the status quo. When I see the diversity of our workshop groups, it’s amazing.”</p>",

About 13 high-risk types of HPV are known to cause 99.7% of cervical cancers.</p> <p>Each year, about 3,200 women in the UK are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 850 die from it. It is the 14th most common cancer affecting women in Britain, with women aged 30 to 34 most likely to receive a diagnosis. Last year, NHS England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/15/nhs-england-boss-to-say-cervical-cancer-can-be-eliminated-by-2040\">pledged to wipe out cervical cancer by 2040</a>.</p> <p>Globally, it is the fourth most common cancer in women, with about 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization.</p> <p>The disease develops when abnormal cells appear in the lining of the cervix and grow, eventually coming together as a tumour. If the cells are not caught early, the cancer can spread to other parts of the body. </p> <p>In June, NHS England said that women aged between 25 and 49 who test negative for HPV, meaning they are at very low risk of cervical cancer over the next 10 years, will safely be invited at five-year intervals instead of three.</p> <p>Fiona Osgun, Cancer Research UK’s head of health information, said the declining rates were due to a combination of factors.</p> <p>“We know that people have specific barriers to accessing screening; some of those are practical such as not being able to get an appointment at a time that works for them, but some are more specific to the test itself, such as finding the screening painful or being worried about who’s going to be carrying out the test,” Osgun said.</p> <p>“I think we have just seen a slow decline, which unfortunately can happen even with successful screening programmes.</p> <p>“We need to continue to chip away at those misunderstandings and misconceptions some people have regarding cervical screening.”</p> <p>Osgun added that there were various measures people could ask for to make their cervical screening test more comfortable, such as asking for a double appointment or a different-sized speculum.</p> <p>Dr Amanda Doyle, national director for primary care and community services at NHS England, said: “The NHS HPV vaccination programme has already helped save thousands of lives and we need to go further to boost uptake of HPV vaccines and cervical screening to help eliminate cervical cancer in England by 2040.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In fashion, only the real favourites have acronyms. See SJP for Sarah Jessica Parker, ALT for the fashion editor André Leon Talley and – particularly relevant right now – CBK for Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.</p> <p>The wife of John F Kennedy Jr who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/19/kennedy.usa7?CMP=gu_com\">died in a plane crash in 1999</a> is sometimes seen as America’s answer to Diana, Princess of Wales. Like Diana, she was loved for her style – called minimalist, chic or “quiet luxury”. Instagram is full of accounts posting archive images of her, influential brands such as The Row, Toteme and Gabriela Hearst design clothes that channel her approach to dressing and there have been books and auctions in recent years.</p> <p>The full extent of the deification became clear this week when images of the actor Sarah Pidgeon as Bessette Kennedy in Ryan Murphy’s forthcoming Kennedys Netflix series American Love Story were seen for the first time.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2Zlxwv984/?img_index=6&amp;igsh=aWN0cDI4dzdndG5y\">one image on Murphy’s Instagram</a>, Pidgeon is pictured wearing a rumpled knee-length brown coat, cropped trousers and black polo neck, with a Birkin bag and bright blond hair, while <a href=\"https://www.justjared.com/photo-gallery/5172687/sarah-pidgeon-american-love-story-carolyn-kennedy-filming-02/\">on-set images</a> show her in a satin midi skirt, Converse and leathery jacket.</p> <p>There was an immediate reaction online, and it’s fair to say fans do not approve. “This is fashion murder,” wrote one in the comments on the Murphy post. “Whoever styled cbk needs to be fired,” wrote another. Details seem to particularly irk – from the wrong shade of blond (Bessette Kennedy’s hair colourist Brad Johns described it as <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/carolyn-bessette-kennedys-colorist-on-the-totally-wrong-hair-color-in-those-ryan-murphy-images\">“too 2024”</a>) to the bag. Eagle-eyed observers have noticed it’s a Birkin 35, a slight variation from her preferred Birkin 40.</p>    <p>Such is the outrage that Murphy, in an <a href=\"https://puck.news/newsletter_content/kerings-comeback-plan-luca-ology-ryan-murphy-on-the-cbk-outcry-2/\">interview</a> with the fashion industry newsletter Line Sheet, described the images as a “work in progress” and clarified that the “right” items would be swapped in, including that Birkin bag. He admitted that the reaction had taken him by surprise. “I had no idea that people cared as much as they do, but I guess that’s a good thing,” he said. Twenty online experts on Bessette Kennedy’s style have been approached to consult on the wardrobe.</p> <p>Murphy, whose work has often taken on real-life figures, from Truman Capote to Joan Crawford, is no stranger to fashion on screen. He made The Assassination of Gianni Versace in 2018 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/14/halston-almost-forgotten-icon-netflix-biopic-fashion\">Halston</a>, about the 70s designer, in 2021. This is the first time, however, that one of his productions has taken on a fashion icon who has citizen archivists logging her every look online. This contrast is the issue, argues the fashion writer Liana Satenstein. “I don’t know if you can include the painstaking research in a miniseries that has such an element of camp to it,” she argues. “It would be this bizarre dichotomy.”</p> <p>The legend around Bessette Kennedy’s style has reached mythical level in the 26 years since her death. A publicist at Calvin Klein, she began dating Kennedy in 1994. The two became the focus of paparazzi, with photographers snapping Bessette Kennedy on the streets of New York wearing labels such as Calvin Klein (then designed by Narciso Rodriguez), Yohji Yamamoto, Prada and Comme des Garçons, but also staples such as jeans, white shirts and polo necks.</p> <p>Fans talk about the way she tailored her jeans and how she removed labels from designer clothing. In an era when personal style is seen as the ultimate status symbol in fashion, it’s these details that have made Bessette Kennedy a lodestar.</p> <p>“It was ‘this is me, this is Carolyn, take it or leave it,’” says Sunita Kumar Nair, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/cbk-carolyn-bessette-kennedy-9781419767197\">CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, a Life in Fashion</a>. Amy Odell, who writes the fashion newsletter Back Row and is working on a biography of Gwyneth Paltrow, says it’s in contrast to now. “Many ‘It girls’ today have stylists and personal shoppers,” she argues. “Now, personal style is bought and sold. This was just her taste, how she put herself together every day.”</p>    <p>Jack Sehnert runs the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carolynbessette/?hl=en\">@carolynbessette</a> Instagram account, which has 63,000 followers. He says the popularity of Bessette Kennedy archive images grew because they were a tonic to the existing aesthetic. “Instagram was a barrage of logos and colourful glitz up until about five years ago, when her image started popping up again alongside references from the show Succession,” he argues. “When the term ‘quiet luxury’ went viral, who could have possibly been a better poster girl? The striking images we all know resonate with an entirely new generation because of their elegant simplicity.”</p> <p>But with close to three decades of interest in her style, it’s become a “get the look” commodity. “It goes from real woman to paparazzi shot to an image you see on your screen to a flat lay [of clothing items] to the product that you ultimately buy online,” says Daniel Rogers, the fashion news editor at Vogue.</p> <p>Satenstein agrees. “We’ve been taking this woman’s existence and putting it on a Pinterest board [for a long time],” she says. “It’s a little sad, because I don’t think she had a say in it. [It happened to] Jane Birkin [too] but she passed away later in life, and had some agency over herself.”</p> <p>How should Murphy and his team improve Pidgeon’s outfits before the show debuts next year? When asked if she will be consulting on the project, Kumar Nair replies: “No comment.” But she does say it’s “very smart” to speak to online experts, and suggests also involving those who knew Bessette Kennedy, such as Rodriguez, Calvin Klein and her sister, Lisa. “I would be semi-humble about it and ask them to talk,” she says: “[Bessette Kennedy] was a major curation herself. So that’s how you would have to approach it.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Fossil fuel companies are able to challenge California’s ability to set stricter standards reducing the amount of polluting coming from cars, the US supreme court has ruled in a case that is set to unravel one of the key tools used to curb planet-heating emissions in recent years.</p> <p>The conservative-dominated supreme court voted by seven to two to back a challenge by oil and gas companies, along with 17 Republican-led states, to a waiver that California has received periodically from the federal government since 1967 that allows it to set tougher standards than national rules limiting pollution from cars. The state has separately stipulated that only zero-emission cars will be able to sold there by 2035.</p> <p>Although states are typically not allowed to set their own standards aside from the federal Clean Air Act, California has been given unique authority to do so via a waiver that has seen it become a pioneer in pushing for cleaner cars. Other states are allowed to copy California’s stricter standard, too.</p> <p>But oil and gas companies, as well as Republican politicians, have complained about the waiver, arguing that it caused financial harm. The waiver was removed during Donald Trump’s first term but then reinstated by Joe Biden’s administration.</p> <p>Last week, Trump again moved to end the waiver, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/06/statement-by-the-president/\">signing</a> a congressional disapproval of California’s move to cut pollution and shift new cars and trucks to become electric over the next decade. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor and a Democrat, who is in a huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/20/la-protests-appeals-court-trump-california-national-guard\">head-to-head battle</a> with the White House over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles-ice-protests\">Los Angeles protests</a> and state power, amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, has called this move illegal and has said the state will sue.</p> <p>The justices’ ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit by a Valero Energy subsidiary and fuel industry groups.</p> <p>The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 EPA decision to let California set its own regulations.</p> <p>“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.</p> <p>Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the decision.</p> <p>The lower court had previously ruled that the oil and gas industry didn’t have legal standing to attempt to topple the California waiver but a challenge to this reached the supreme court, which appeared sympathetic to the claim when the case was heard in April. “It’s not that high a burden,” Amy Coney Barrett, one of the justices, said about proof of the alleged harm.</p> <p>California and the federal government have been allowed to “stretch and abuse” the Clean Air Act, the American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers, one of the groups challenging the waiver, has complained.</p> <p>But environmentalists and California’s Democratic leadership have defended the waiver, arguing that it has helped push forward vehicle innovation and help cut greenhouse gases. Transportation is responsible for more planet-heating pollution in the US than any other sector.</p> <p>“California and other clean car states cannot achieve federal clean air standards and protect communities without reducing harmful transportation pollution,” said Andrea Issod, senior attorney at the Sierra Club. “We stand with these states to defend their well-established authority to set standards for clean cars.”</p> <p>The supreme court’s ruling on Friday does not in itself end California’s standards to cut pollution from vehicles, said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.</p> <p>“The standards have saved hundreds of lives, have provided enormous health benefits, and have saved families money,” Patton said.</p> <p>“While the supreme court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court, the decision does not affect California’s bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does it alter the life-saving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The work of the photographer Nick Hedges, who has died aged 81, revealed the reality of the atrocious living conditions of the UK’s urban poor in the 1960s and 70s. His compassionate work transformed perceptions, and helped galvanise social change.</p> <p>In 1966, a new charity was launched: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/dec/01/housing-crisis-1966-des-wilson-shelter\">Shelter, the National Campaign for the Homeless</a>. That same year, Ken Loach’s revelatory drama documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/31/cathy-come-home-50-years-homelessness-mental-health-problems\">Cathy Come Home</a> highlighted the problem of homelessness in a country that complacently believed in the rose-tinted idea of the swinging 60s.</p>    <p>“I always maintain I was fortunate to be born when I was, because in the 60s we believed a revolution was possible,” Hedges told the British Journal of Photography in 2023. “I was working with people who thought it was possible to change the situation the country was in. It was invigorating and exciting.”</p> <p>Those people worked for Shelter. In 1968, they commissioned Hedges to document the brutal environment in which poor people lived, some in slums that had been due for demolition before the second world war. The charity wanted to use the images in their campaigns, reports and literature that was designed to educate the public about the inequality on their doorstep: to use documentary photography as political activism – demanding more social housing.</p> <p>Hedges photographed families in many neglected inner cities, including in Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and London. Sometimes he would be introduced to his subjects by social workers or housing association workers, and sometimes he would just knock on doors in run-down areas. He always explained himself, and what Shelter was trying to do. He had no intention of disrespecting the inhabitants by trying to take “candid” photographs. The responsibility weighed heavily on him: “Part of my duty as a photographer is to honour the trust placed in me by people with no voice.”</p> <p>He said it was “essential to develop a relationship of trust: nothing was ever forced, nothing was ever staged. Your own presence had to be reduced to the minimum. I used a 35mm Leica camera and available light and, in the small rooms, I often found myself crouching down in a corner listening and watching, just allowing things to develop and occur in front of the camera.”</p>    <p>Shot in grainy, dark monochrome; the results were raw, poignant and powerful. Those few men who were present “often demonstrated an uneasy guilt”, Hedges said. They “were more reluctant to be photographed, as if the image itself would become a signature of failure”. Many of the women also turn away from the camera as if somehow responsible for their own straitened circumstances, resigned to their powerlessness.</p> <p>It is left to the children to issue a challenge to society – staring into the lens, straight at the viewer, with an accusatory gaze.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Part of my duty as a photographer is to honour the trust placed in me by people with no voice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, what pours forth from Hedges’ sensitive images is dignity, resilience and the unbreakable bonds between parents and their children, and between siblings – the depiction of unconditional love in unspeakable conditions. Family, wrote Hedges, “provides meaning to our lives and rewards us with comfort in an uncertain world”.</p> <p>Nick was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to Norman, a timber merchant manager, and Dorothy (nee Chapman), an arts and crafts teacher.</p> <p>He attended Stourbridge Road junior school, followed by King’s school, Worcester. As a teenager, his political conscience, sense of purpose and love of jazz music were awakened. In 1965 he joined the photography course at Birmingham School of Art, where he embraced sixties radicalism. He was inspired by the work of the American Farm Security Administration photographers, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/17/dorothea-lange-politics-of-seeing-barbican-review\">Dorothea Lange</a> and, most profoundly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/jul/18/walker-evans-america-moma-in-pictures\">Walker Evans</a>, whose book with James Agee, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, documented the lives of impoverished tenant farmers during the Great Depression in the 30s.</p>    <p>For his final year project, Hedges worked with Birmingham Housing Trust on an exhibition about the city’s poorly housed low-income households. He was in the trust’s offices, having just signed on as unemployed, “pasting large 6ft by 4ft photographs I had taken for them on to panels that were to be displayed outside in Birmingham city centre”, Hedges recalled in an interview. “Someone popped their head around the door, looked at the images and said: ‘Nice photographs.’ About two weeks later, I had a phone call from Shelter asking me whether I’d like to join them to document bad housing across the country. Accident and chance play such a large part in our lives – we often don’t admit to it.”</p> <p>Having completed his four-year assignment, Hedges left Shelter in 1972. He then worked as a freelance photographer for Mencap, the BBC, Penguin Books and many other organisations; a commission from one, the Royal Town Planning Institute, resulted in an exhibition, Problem in the City, at the ICA, London, in 1976.</p>    <p>He was awarded an Arts Council fellowship to make a three-year study of working lives in the factories and steelworks of the West Midlands. Those images were exhibited in London and Paris in 1979, and a book, Born to Work, was published in 1982. Hedges produced a series on different religious groups in Wolverhampton, rural life in Worcestershire, and in 1979 he documented the local fishing industry for Newcastle’s Side Gallery.</p> <p>His active life as a photographer came to an end in 1980, when he became the head of photography at West Midlands College of Higher Education and later of the University of Wolverhampton. Hedges left teaching due to ill health in 2003, and in his later years developed a passion for collecting old hand-tinted picture postcards, a selection of which were published in the collection Painted Ladies in 2006.</p> <p>Hedges had long imposed a restriction on the use of the photographs he took for Shelter to protect the identity of the subjects, particularly the children. However, as the 50th anniversary of the charity approached, the photographer lifted the curb: he felt it was important that people could view our shared social history, as “understanding our past is crucial to shaping our future”. In 2014, his work for Shelter was exhibited as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/oct/01/below-the-poverty-line-slum-britain-in-the-1960s-in-pictures\">Make Life Worth Living at London’s Science Museum</a>, to great acclaim, and led to the award of the 2016 Hood medal from the Royal Photographic Society. In 2021 the Shelter photographs were published as Home, alongside another book, Street.</p> <p>Loach said that Hedges’ “work is not only deeply human, an expression of our shared humanity, it is also important as evidence. This is how life is, and how it was.”</p> <p>He is survived by Ruth and Annie, his daughters from his marriage to Diana Roberts, a social worker (which ended in divorce), four grandchildren, and two siblings, Roger and Julie.</p> <p>• Nick (Rupert Nicholas Wilmore) Hedges, photographer, born 31 December 1943; died 8 June 2025</p>",

So that means I’m getting the first light to hit Britain on Midsummer Day, and it feels mystical and like something special is happening to me,’” Hemingway said.</p> <p>Throwing a big party on the town’s vast, sandy beaches seemed the ideal way to celebrate this, and for Hemingway one of the most important elements has been engaging the community, with local musicians, schools and choirs all performing.</p> <p>The town’s teenagers were initially dubious of the festival’s Balearic vibe. “They were a bit disruptive,” says Hemingway, “because they’d not heard this kind of music – they were more into house [music]. The next year, the same lot came back and said: ‘Actually, we like this music, we’ve got into it … can we help you clear up after?’ Every year they come back and help. They’re about 18 now and one of them is DJing.” </p>",

Most of all, coming together.”</p> <p>Herbert was one of the many thousands who had made their way to Wiltshire – he in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/p/The-adventures-of-Radagast-the-van-100055053822145/?locale=en_GB\">his faithful van Radagast</a> – to take in midsummer in and around Stonehenge.</p>    <p>This one may be the most well attended for years as the solstice dawn takes place on Saturday and the weather is set pretty much perfect to observe the sun rising behind the heel stone – the ancient entrance to the monument from the ceremonial avenue – and watch its rays channel into the centre of the stone circle.</p> <p>There will be tedious practical challenges.</p> <p>National Highways has said the <a href=\"https://www.mnrjournal.co.uk/news/drivers-encouraged-to-plan-a303-journeys-ahead-of-stonehenge-summer-solstice-803067\">A303 and other roads around the sites will be very busy</a> and urged visitors to use public transport or car share if possible. While <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/things-to-do/solstice/\">English Heritage, which manages the site</a> and offers controlled, free “open access” to the stones for the solstice, said people would need to use an app to pay for parking.</p> <p>There is a poignancy, too, as it is 40 years since the Battle of the Beanfield, the notorious clash between police and new age travellers. Four decades on, there are still <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c780ve9nde0o\">calls for an inquiry into the actions of Wiltshire police</a> as they halted a free solstice festival at Stonehenge.</p> <p>Some still feel the anguish of the experience and do not like the way the “open access” is policed and limited.</p> <p>Alan Lodge, who was there that day, said: “They want to put Stonehenge in a glass case but they wouldn’t do that with Salisbury Cathedral. People are allowed to go there in their thousands all year round.”</p>    <p>English Heritage argues that it needs to strike a balance between opening the site and preserving it, while Wiltshire police say they have learned from what happened in 1985 and are working hard to ensure the solstice celebrations at Stonehenge go smoothly.</p> <p>The practicalities and lingering hurt aside, there was a great deal of joy in the air this week.</p> <p>At the Stonehenge Inn in Durrington, the manager, Dan King, said the pub and the adjacent camping and glamping field were fully booked. “The combination of the weekend and this weather means it’s going to be a busy one,” he said.</p> <p>Hundreds of people had gathered at the Stonehenge Campsite at Winterbourne Stoke for Solsticefest 25, a four-day celebration involving music, crafts and healing. The site runs bus shuttles to Stonehenge for the solstice.</p> <p>At the campsite, as at the circle on solstice morning, an eclectic mix of people had gathered.</p>    <p>Nicky Jasmine, from Manchester, a volunteer at the site, said everyone was welcome. “We don’t judge what people are wearing, we don’t judge their beliefs.”</p> <p>There were pagans there, such as Adrian Thompson and Tina Lyons. Thompson, 62, a window blind fitter from Leicester, said the solstice was a chance to “honour the ancestors” – and make new friends.</p> <p>Chris Richards, a 35-year-old carer from Wolverhampton, said a few drinks and a party was certainly an element of the experience, but he also loved “cuddling up” with his friends at the circle at dawn. “Even when it’s hot like this, it can get chilly. We get into a ditch; the wind blows over you and the sun rises. It’s wonderful. I’ll always come here.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When Bell Shakespeare artistic director Peter Evans was handed the keys to the company’s new home at Pier 2/3 in Sydney’s Walsh Bay, he knew precisely with which play he wanted to christen the space. With its generously proportioned stage, and unusually intimate 250-seat audience accommodation, Coriolanus – one of Shakespeare’s most political, and least-performed, tragedies – was his top pick.</p> <p>It didn’t happen.</p> <p>The national theatre company instead opted for Shakespeare’s crowd pleasers – Twelfth Night, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth – to introduce audiences to its new harbourside performance space, the Neilson Nutshell. But three years on, Evans has finally got his way as Bell Shakespeare tackles Coriolanus for the first time in almost three decades.</p> <p>In the new production, Shakespeare’s bruising exploration of politics, power and civic identity plays out in front of an audience split into two sides; where you sit will determine whose side the cast assumes you are on, patrician or plebeian. Palestinian Australian actor and Logie winner Hazem Shammas plays Coriolanus, a decorated general whose rigid elitism and disdain for the common people make him both hero and heretic.</p>    <p> Shammas played Macbeth for Bell Shakespeare two years ago and Evans finds the juxtaposition of the two roles compelling: while Macbeth charts the psychological collapse of an ambitious man, Coriolanus is all rigidity and resolve – a man with no time for soliloquies or self-doubt.</p> <p> His inflexible convictions on the right of Rome’s elite to continue wielding unchecked power fly in the face of the fledgling republic’s ambitions for democracy, an experiment dependant on compromise.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Coriolanus cannot bend so he breaks, and in spectacular fashion; banished from Rome, the general switches sides and joins the enemy, his love for his city turned to vengeance in a binary act of political spite. The political thriller transforms into a revenge drama.</p> <p>“Coriolanus is absolutely a character of conviction, and he has very clear and elitist views of the way Rome should work,” says Evans. “And what makes him remarkable is how, to his own detriment, he steadfastly sticks to those convictions.</p> <p>“I’m interested in how complicated that makes the audience feel when they’re watching it – you disagree with him, but you can also see the appeal of his certainty.”</p> <p>With its precarious dance between autocracy and democracy, Evans resisted mapping the play, set in the fledgling democracy of the Roman Republic circa 490BCE, too neatly onto “modern headlines”. And Coriolanus is, after all, the antithesis of a populist leader.</p> <p>Evans has staged the play in another distinctive time and place: post–cold war eastern Europe in the early 1990s, as it picks itself up from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.</p> <p>“There was this hope that [eastern Europe] would become this great liberal democracy,” he says. “And then, of course, through the ’90s we get the rise of the oligarchs, and end up in what is another autocracy and a very specific kind of a leader, led by an elite.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/mar/23/peter-carroll-australian-actor-fur-phobia-cats-q-a\">Peter Carroll: ‘I had a fur phobia for many years – after I performed in Cats’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coriolanus remains one of Shakespeare’s least performed plays; this is only the second time Bell Shakespeare has staged it since the company was established in 1990.</p> <p>“Even though it has the most amazing domestic scenes – and Coriolanus’s mother and wife are extraordinary characters – it’s certainly more overtly political than many of the others,” Evans says.</p> <p>“It shows us that while complete conviction can be compelling in a politician, if they are inflexible, then it will eventually lead to an autocratic rule.”</p> <p>Coriolanus may not have the marquee appeal of a Macbeth or Hamlet, but Evans contends that its relevance is perennially urgent.</p> <p>“A play like this is never not timely. In the last five to 10 years, western democracy has come under question … and certainly, when I was growing up, that would have been unthinkable.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.bellshakespeare.com.au/coriolanus\">Coriolanus</a> plays in Sydney’s Neilson Nutshell until 20 July, then the Arts Centre Melbourne from 24 July to 10 August</em></p></li> </ul>",

There have been, according to some, more than two years of “shit fights”, “constant stupidity and self-harm” that have allowed “an inept Labor government” to evade scrutiny, despite the best efforts of a few opposition MPs.</p> <p>Some hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/19/victoria-liberals-bail-out-john-pesutto-with-15m-loan-to-avoid-bankruptcy-ntwnfb\">the party’s decision to loan Pesutto $1.5m so he can pay Deeming’s legal fees, avoiding bankruptcy</a>, may lead to a truce. But others suggest animosity runs deep and the party will struggle to heal while both remain in the party room.</p> <h2>Hand over your weapons</h2> <p>On Thursday night, members of the party’s administrative committee handed over their phones to an official before voting in a secret ballot.</p> <p>Pesutto, who had only a matter of days to raise $2.3m, outlined a last-minute loan deal using his superannuation as security, repayable with a commercial interest rate.</p> <p>This was, for some on the committee, the first time they had been briefed on the proposal despite reading about it in the media for several weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/24/victoria-liberal-party-john-pesutto-defamation-costs-ntwnfb\">Inside the Liberals’ battle to save John Pesutto from bankruptcy</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/02/bankruptcy-notice-john-pesutto-moira-deeming-victorian-liberal-party-ntwnfb\">When Deeming’s lawyers filed a bankruptcy notice against Pesutto</a>, the Victorian Liberal party president, Philip Davis, began to canvass the views of his colleagues. Those strongly opposed were kept in the dark until the secret ballot.</p> <p>“My position is well known,” said one admin member contacted by Davis. “No, no, no, no, how many times can I say no.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Several members of the committee were furious at the prospect of party money being spent on an internal dispute, rather than on campaigning to beat Labor.</p> <p>The proposal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/28/victorian-liberals-prepare-last-minute-bid-to-bail-out-john-pesutto-with-loan-to-help-pay-23m-defamation-costs-ntwnfb\">first reported by Guardian Australia</a>, was pushed by Pesutto’s supporters as a way to avoid an expensive byelection in his seat of Hawthorn and to ensure, in their view, that moderate MPs were not pushed out of the party.</p> <p>Even before the meeting was called, Pesutto’s supporters put pressure on the party leader, Brad Battin, to endorse the loan and give it momentum.</p> <p>“We’re already in a shit fight, but if Brad doesn’t support a loan, it will lead to all-out war,” threatened one Liberal MP who declined to be named so they could speak freely.</p> <p>Another MP said Battin “should not be the one to stand in the way of a deal that has support” from the party room and a majority of the committee.</p> <p>This did not go down well with some on the committee.</p> <p>“All this media stuff is emotional blackmail,” said one committee member who declined to be named given the tense nature of discussions.</p> <p>When the deal was ultimately approved, Davis emailed party members to claim it would “settle the matter once and for all” and allow the party to move on without further distraction.</p> <p>Battin, who endorsed the motion, said it would “avoid further financial and reputational damage” and also declared the matter resolved, with the party now “united, disciplined and determined” to focus on the future.</p> <p>Not everyone agrees.</p>    <h2>‘They will always be looking over their shoulder’</h2> <p>Before the meeting, Deeming said she was dismayed a loan deal was even being considered. She said it ran “against the grain of everything we believe as Liberals” and claimed it would be a “direct rebuke” of the federal court judgment.</p> <p>“I assume that they will continue with their quest to try to annihilate me,” Deeming said in reference to some of her party room colleagues.</p> <p>Pesutto’s supporters remain bitter the party only intervened at the final hour after relentless pressure to do, in their view, the right thing.</p> <p>Others won’t forget that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/28/victorian-liberals-prepare-last-minute-bid-to-bail-out-john-pesutto-with-loan-to-help-pay-23m-defamation-costs-ntwnfb\">Deeming’s legal team threatened to chase money from Pesutto’s supporters</a> should he not be able to pay. Correspondence named former Liberal premiers Jeff Kennett, Denis Napthine and Ted Baillieu, and Victorian MPs David Southwick and Georgie Crozier as people who may be held liable.</p> <p>“How can those two MPs sit in the party room with someone who was willing to do that and trust her?” said one Liberal source. “They will always be looking over their shoulder.”</p> <p>Deeming did not respond to that comment, but a source close to her denied any allegation that she was untrustworthy, dishonest or a bully.</p> <p>Her financial backer, the New South Wales property developer Hilton Grugeon, who is owed $2.3m, said he was not bothered by the damage this would have unleashed on the party.</p> <p>“I supported [the Liberals] when they were unsupportable,” Grugeon said. “But I cannot care what happens to a party that wants to look the other way while their leader beats up on a woman who did nothing wrong.”</p> <h2>‘We’ve got to get completely brutal’</h2> <p>Shortly before lodging bankruptcy proceedings against Pesutto, Deeming outlined a vision of the Liberal party that is antithetical to some of her colleagues.</p> <p>In late May, Deeming told the podcast Club Grubbery praised the rightwing South Australian senator Alex Antic’s ability to control his state branch and said “nobody can get rid of him”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/12/victorian-liberal-john-pesutto-loan-moira-deeming-defamation-costs-ntwnfb\">Victorian Liberal party could reap $1m in interest from loan that would see John Pesutto repay $10,000 a month</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We need to take back ownership of the party of the centre right,” Deeming said, before speaking to its rank-and-file. “This is your party. You own it, it’s yours. Do not cede this ground.”</p> <p>“We’ve really got to get really mercenary about it,” said Deeming, who raised the prospect of working with Antic and Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to recruit more like-minded members. “We’ve got to get completely brutal.”</p> <p>But many moderates, including former federal vice-president Tom Harley, warn any push to become more conservative would make the party electorally irrelevant. Harley is scathing of the party’s internal divisions, describing them as being in a state of “constant stupidity and self-harm”.</p> <p>“The Liberal party in Victoria is stuck talking to a small section of itself in the corner,” Harley said. “We must focus on the issues that matter to people, not who goes to which lavatory.”</p> <p>Others, including the federal Liberal MP Jason Wood, believe factionalism is tearing the state party apart, rather than being a disagreement about values.</p> <p>“Hopefully all this sorts itself and everyone takes a chill pill but, sadly, people are putting their factions first,” Wood said.</p> <p>Many Victorian Liberals deny they have factions equivalent to the rigid blocs that divide power in the Labor party. But they don’t dispute that their party is bitterly divided.</p> <h2>‘It’s not that easy to just move on’</h2> <p>On Friday morning, Pesutto said he was “grateful and humbled” by the party’s decision to save him from bankruptcy and his colleagues would “focus all our energy on winning the next state election”.</p> <p>But some didn’t get the memo. Within hours of the deal being approved, one unnamed conservative MP told the Herald Sun that Battin’s leadership was in question and “<a href=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/john-pesutto-hours-from-learning-political-fate-at-liberal-party-committee-meeting/news-story/9df8b1b690e6200c0b54e1dab4c36205\">the conservative block will want a ‘please explain’</a>”.</p> <p>One senior Liberal operative not authorised to speak publicly believes the party’s leadership team allowed the saga to remain unresolved for too long. They argue the damage will now be difficult to contain, despite a resolution being reached.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/05/moderate-liberals-say-the-party-has-a-choice-be-a-far-right-rump-run-by-octogenarians-or-move-to-the-centre\">Moderate Liberals say the party has a choice – be a far-right rump run by octogenarians or move to the centre | Anne Davies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“If there had been good leadership of the party, the John and Moira saga might have been dealt with very differently and much quicker,” the source said. “But no one stood up. They all thought, ‘oh this will be fine, it will be buried’. But it wasn’t buried. And that’s how we’ve got to this stage.”</p> <p>On Thursday night, just hours after the loan was secured, some members of Deeming’s branch urged each other to draw a line under the scandal and focus attention on Labor.</p> <p>“Let’s move on now,” said one member in a WhatsApp message leaked to Guardian Australia. “We have got an election to win.”</p> <p>One of Deeming’s closest allies, her husband, Andrew, replied saying, “sadly it’s not that easy to just move on”.</p> <p>“Personally, my kids have nightmares because of this. Moira still gets abusive messages because of this. Politically, the party just reinforced all its negative stereotypes that they are anti-woman, that they are an old boys club,” Andrew Deeming said.</p> <p>“How can we convince the public that the Liberal party cares about them when the Liberal party has given effective support to an MP who defamed his own colleague?”</p> <p>The text messages show Moira Deeming is bitterly disappointed by the organisational wing’s conduct.</p> <p>“They literally sent a bulk email to brag about earning interest off ruining my life and destroying my family,” she wrote. “Disgusting.”</p> <p>Deeming confirmed she sent the message and told Guardian Australia it explained her motivation for uploading an image on social media that said: “They financially profited off her trauma. They told the world they did her a favour. This is what institutional abuse looks like.”</p> <p>“Clearly, it is undeniable that there are deep wounds,” Deeming said. “There have been wrongs done. The things I needed were full exoneration and my loan repaid. I now have those two things.”</p> <p>Pesutto may have been saved from bankruptcy, but the Victorian Liberals’ internal battles are far from over.</p>",

In January, 206 psychiatrists in NSW threatened to resign; 62 have resigned, while others await the commission’s decision.</p> <p>In closing submissions Thomas Dixon, the barrister for Asmof, pointed the commission to evidence it had heard about the “proliferation” of mental health patient presentations in the public health system in recent years, at the same time there has been a reduction in the number of public psychiatric specialists.</p> <p>Dixon said that in the five years from July 2019, the number of staff psychiatric specialist vacancies in NSW increased from 35 full-time equivalent (FTE) roles to 131, a near 400% increase.</p> <p>“Why is this occurring?” he asked the full bench. “The reasons are many, including pay … stress, overwork and concern for patient outcomes. All of these factors were caused or exacerbated by staff shortages.</p> <p>“Staff shortages are having a negative impact on the quality of patient care and integrity of the health system.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>According to Asmof, psychiatrists are paid significantly more in states other than NSW. Salaries were up to 51% higher in Western Australia, 44% higher in the Northern Territory, 38% higher in South Australia, 28% in Queensland and 25% in Tasmania. They are 2% higher in Victoria, but Asmof said that in Victoria, as most psychiatrists do not work full-time, they are paid an hourly rate which amounts to 31% more than in NSW.</p> <p>Dixon reminded the court of evidence it had heard that giving a pay rise to psychiatrists would actually end up costing the government less than its current policy, which was to fill gaps in staffing with locums or visiting medical officers (VMOs). Dixon said that a full-time staff psychiatrist cost the same as a VMO working at 0.6FTE.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/12/nsw-health-could-save-35m-a-year-by-giving-psychiatrists-a-25-pay-rise-modelling-suggests-ntwnfb\">NSW Health could save $35m a year by giving psychiatrists a 25% pay rise, modelling suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ian Neil SC, the barrister representing the secretary of health and the NSW department of health, argued that there was no evidence that increasing the pay of psychiatrists with a special levy would have any impact on the attraction and retention of staff, except for stopping those who had threatened resignation pending the outcome of the arbitration, which he urged the court not to consider.</p> <p>“Asmof loaded up the gun and pointed it at our heads,” Neil said of the mass resignation threat. “That ought not to be taken into account.”</p> <p>Neil told the court that increasing the pay for psychiatrists by 25% in an interim 12-month order was problematic in that it meant the commission would have to keep that pay uplift in other award negotiations going forward, and that it would not address the issue that Asmof hoped it would remedy.</p> <p>“Wage fixing is not an appropriate mechanism to address the problem of attraction and retention, of itself,” he said.</p> <p>“The problem of workplace shortages … are a much more nuanced problem that requires a nuanced response.”</p> <p>Neil was pushed by the justices to give an account of what the health secretary contended the solution was for the problem of attraction and retention, if not a pay increase, to which he said:</p> <p>“There is no simple answer to that question because it’s not a simple issue. It would be a simple issue if funds were infinite, it would be a simple issue if the source of trained staff specialist psychiatrists were infinite, but none of those propositions are true or realistic.”</p> <p>The full bench has adjourned to consider its judgment.</p>",

Nearby hangs a series of rusty and battered road signs etched with coruscating designs. “Road closed due to ceremony” reads one; “You are on the Arnhem Land Aboriginal Land Trust” reads another.</p> <p>This is Yirrkala: a small community in the north-eastern tip of the Top End and a huge presence in contemporary Australian art. Yolŋu artists working with Yirrkala’s arts centre have been constant fixtures at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art awards (Natsiaa) for the last three decades and have been the subject of surveys at the <a href=\"https://www.agsa.sa.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/tarnanthi-agsa/\">Art Gallery of South Australia</a> (AGSA), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2021/dec/17/bark-ladies-the-painters-reimagining-ancestral-beings-mermaids-and-the-yolu-universe-in-pictures\">NGV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sea.museum/en/first-nations/sea-country-and-the-saltwater-collection\">Australian National Maritime Museum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/old-masters\">National Museum of Australia</a>, as well as major <a href=\"https://madayin.kluge-ruhe.org/\">international touring exhibitions</a>.</p> <p>Now these artists are being celebrated at the Art Gallery of NSW (AGNSW) in the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/yolngu-power/\">Yolŋu power: the art of Yirrkala</a>.</p>    <p>What makes art from this part of Australia so powerful? Curator Cara Pinchbeck says it’s partly the Yolŋu appetite for innovation, combined with the stable leadership of Yirrkala’s arts centre, Buku-Larrŋgay Mulka, who is co-curator of the AGNSW exhibition.</p> <p>But mostly, Pinchbeck says, it’s down to Yolŋu culture: the numerous song cycles detailing the creation stories of the various clans, and their connected designs – from which all art flows. Underpinning this is gurrutu: an all-encompassing system of connection that maps out each person’s relationship to not only other people but every other thing.</p>    <p>Even just breezing through Yolŋu Power, you get a sense of the vast richness of this culture and cosmology, across almost 300 works in a kaleidoscope of styles, mediums and subjects – from ochred bark paintings of creation stories and intricately decorated larrakitj (hollow poles) to digital projections, detailed depictions of plant life and minimalist abstractions evoking the Milky Way and the estuaries where fresh and saltwater meet.</p> <p>But if you take the time to really read the wall text and look at the detail of the artwork, an even richer story unfolds. It’s the story of a people for whom art is inextricably enmeshed with their understanding of the universe and themselves; a community who, since the 1930s, have used art as a tool of cultural diplomacy with outsiders; and a constellation of individuals who have found ways to maintain millennia-old cultural practices, while boldly innovating for changing times.</p>    <p>Past the panoramic video and etched road signs at the exhibition entrance, you pass through a darkened curvilinear chamber hung with a series of Rumbal (body) paintings in ochre on bark, depicting ceremonial designs from the 16 clans around Yirrkala. These designs – or miny’tji – are more than decorative: they express identity, ancestral connections, spiritual beliefs and Country itself. They are sacred and ancient. But these works were painted within the last few years, a statement that the cultural foundations and connections remain strong and vital.</p> <p>These miny’tji are the root of what audiences will see in the next rooms. Sometimes the patterns are in plain sight: the shimmering strings of diamonds in works by artists from Maḏarrpa and Gumatj clans, or the striations of straight and curved lines in works by Marrakulu and Rirratjiŋu artists. Sometimes they’re merely hinted at – and even when they’re not visible in the artwork, they’re essential; the indelible cultural DNA of each maker.</p>    <p>Beyond the Rumbal chamber, the exhibition proceeds more or less chronologically, starting with the frontrunners who first painted these body designs on bark, adopting art as a form of cultural diplomacy with balanda/ŋäpaki (non-Yolŋu people). The exhibition closes with an explosion of dazzling innovation, including bark paintings using magenta printer-toner (by Noŋgirrŋa Marawili) and electric blue acrylic (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/06/it-keeps-me-alive-the-politically-potent-bark-paintings-of-dhambit-munugurr\">Dhambit Munuŋgurr</a>), and intricately etched sculptures made from mining detritus such as rubber conveyor belts and aluminium signs (by artists including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/10/natsiaa-2018-young-guns-breathe-new-life-into-indigenous-art-traditions\">Gunybi Ganambarr</a>).</p> <p>Highlights include detailed and meticulous bark paintings by pioneering artist and activist Narritjin Maymuru, who contributed to the Näku Dhäruk (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/13/yunupiu-played-the-long-game-on-native-title-and-has-finally-won\">Yirrkala bark petitions</a>) of 1963, which asserted Yolŋu sovereignty over land leased by the government to mining companies; and shimmering bark paintings by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/07/our-voice-is-the-spirit-of-this-country-connecting-yolngu-parliament-in-arnhem-land-to-canberra\">Djambawa Marrawili</a>, including one from the Saltwater series that was successfully used by clans of the Blue Mud Bay area to assert sea rights in the federal court.</p>    <p>As the exhibition proceeds, works by women proliferate, the visible shift of senior men permitting their daughters to paint their clans’ miny’tji. Other women opted for everyday subjects. An entire room is given over to exquisite secular works on bark, canvas and larrakitj by female artists, including major figures such as Nyapanyapa Yunupiŋu and Gulumbu Yunupiŋu. Plant life is strongly represented, with Malaluba Gumana’s mesmerising paintings of dhatam (water lilies) and Djirrirra Wunuŋmurra’s delicate depiction of wild yams. Mulkun Wirrpanda’s illustrations of flowering vines are animated and projected over a termite-mound sculpture, in a luminous installation at the exhibition’s centre.</p> <p>Yolŋu Power is best appreciated with a calm mind and careful attention. For best effect, start in the gallery’s cavernous, subterranean Tank, where Buku’s digital unit, The Mulka Project, has created an immersive installation evoking Yirrkala’s changing seasons. Over 19 minutes, via a soundtrack featuring ancestral songs and field recordings from Country, and a shifting lighting palette, Yalu (Yolŋu for nest, signifying sanctuary) takes viewers through a seasonal cycle in the landscape from which Yirrkala’s art flows. Slow down, breathe deeply – and then head upstairs to take a walk with this extraordinary community of artists.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/yolngu-power/\">Yolŋu power: the art of Yirrkala</a> is at Art Gallery of NSW’s Naala Badu building until 6 October.</em></p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<h2>Doves – Constellations for the Lonely</h2> <p>Constellations for the Lonely is a fabulous return for Doves: textured, layered and, as ever, occupying a space and sound all their own. From the futuristic reflection of Renegade to the soulful Cold Dreaming to the thought provoking A Drop in the Ocean, and the devastating realisation of loss in Last Year’s Man ... This is a band confronting the past, to channel hope and find redemption by coming through challenges that can only be overcome through genuine friendship. <strong>Steven, Wolverhampton </strong></p> <h2>Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más Fotos</h2> <p>This is a timely release, coming mere months after the abhorrent anti-Puerto Rican “floating island of garbage” comments by Tony Hinchcliffe at a Trump rally. Bad Bunny’s response at the time was fierce, rebuking all that was Trump, Republican, bigoted, and his first music since feels like a follow-up. In DTMF, Bunny refuses to cede space or stand down. Either from his position as a mainstay of the US mainstream music world or as a proud Puerto Rican. He crafts an album of one summer anthem after another, built to be listened to by everyone while unmistakably a product of the music of his home. <strong>Alex</strong><strong>, Belfast</strong></p> <h2>Bon Iver – Sable, Fable</h2> <p>Justin Vernon is finally happy! And he sounds perhaps more enchanting as a man embracing joy as he did as a lone wanderer in the wintery woodlands of Wisconsin. The album opens on familiar ground with the Sable tracks, and these build beautifully until we reach Fable and Vernon exclaims: “January ain’t the whole world”. From there on the album is a gorgeous celebration of accepting love and happiness through some incredibly vibey and experimental songs in the Bon Iver signature. If Only I Could Wait, with Danielle Haim is a standout, alongside Walk Home, and the slow submergence into steady love through the album closers There’s a Rhythm and Au Revoir is simply perfect. <strong>Pulkit, Manchester </strong></p> <h2>Vukovi – My God Has Got a Gun</h2> <p>I’m convinced there’s a parallel universe somewhere in which guitar-and-drums-driven rock music still has mass mainstream appeal and Vukovi would deservedly be among the UK’s biggest music stars. On this, their fourth album, the pop-metal leans towards the heavier side, and lyrically perhaps nothing sums up these songs’ exploration of mental health struggles and self-doubt better than opening track This is My Life and My Trauma. But the melodies are strong and front woman Janine Shilstone’s vocals are as fiercely defiant yet beautiful as ever, underpinned perfectly by energetic riffs and tight rhythmical playing from guitarist Hamish Reilly and drummer Martin Sharples-Johnston. <strong>John K, Birmingham </strong></p> <h2>Davido – 5ive</h2> <p>5ive by Davido gives me a new sense of hope and purpose. It helps me get on with my daily activities and to unwind in my free time. As a mum who’s constantly busy caring for a newborn baby, I find listening helps me with my mental health and encourages me to enjoy life and live life to the fullest. The rhetoric in the album is out of this world. <strong>Paola Adeitan, Marlborough, Wiltshire </strong></p> <h2>The Slow Readers Club – Out of a Dream</h2> <p>It’s such a great commentary on modern times, with real lyrical depth added to a sort of doom-pop atmosphere. I stumbled upon them by chance and saw them at a tiny venue in the Netherlands – they’re as great live as they are on their records. I can’t comprehend how they’re not world famous. <strong>Klavdija, Brussels, Belgium </strong></p> <h2>These New Puritans – Crooked Wing</h2>    <p>I hadn’t discovered the band before this album so it was an absolute treat to work through their back catalogue. I love the textures and layers of the music on this album. It’s the perfect soundtrack to my evening walks in my local woods. There is a depth to the music that is spiritual and anything that moves me like this gets my attention. The opening track Waiting has a choral feel. It’s sparse yet such a complete sound with beautiful vocals. It’s not an upbeat album – far from it – but I find it incredibly uplifting. The production throughout is sublime. <strong>Ed Olhausen, High Wycombe </strong></p> <h2>Jensen McRae – I Don’t Know How But They Found Me!</h2> <p>Absolutely every song on the album is worth a listen and suits an occasion in the day. Praying for Your Downfall and Massachusetts are cathartic for different reasons, while Let Me Be Wrong and I Don’t Do Drugs are cheeky and honest. Overall, the album is so human – it touches many emotional experiences with compassion and clarity, and shows off the very best of musical commitment to songwriting, vocals, composition, guitar and production. <strong>Alice, Cambridge </strong></p> <h2>Sleep Token – Even in Arcadia</h2> <p>A perfect storm of everything Sleep Token does best but distilled and sharpened. It’s not a concept album, but feels like one. The lyrics have never been more deific but Vessel has never sounded more human. An incredible follow-up to a near-perfect album. I’ve never been as obsessed with a band as I am with Sleep Token. <strong>Ed, Southampton </strong></p> <h2>Marina – Princess of Power</h2> <p>As a young gay man, Marina (FKA Marina and the Diamonds) was the soundtrack to my teenage years. I adored her cult classic Electra Heart album and remember when she was the undisputed queen of Tumblr. She continued putting out great music, including her previous album, the fantastic and pleasingly political Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land. But now, riding a wave of 2010s nostalgia, Marina is back in the charts and at the top of her game. The whole album is delightfully camp and jam packed with Eurodisco-esque gay club bangers. I predict that, just as with Charli, Marina is heading for a comeback. <strong>Oliver, Manchester </strong></p> <h2>Shura – I Got Too Sad for My Friends</h2> <p>It’s a gorgeous slice of folk-pop that’s swimming with gentle, lovely tunes. World’s Worst Girlfriend is a great way in; Richardson, which features the warm tones of Cassandra Jenkins, has set up semi-permanent residence in my head. <strong>Tom Evershed, Melbourne, Australia </strong></p> <h2>William Tyler – Time Indefinite</h2> <p>Time Indefinite is a powerful record and seemed to arrive at exactly the right time for me. Tyler finds and collects sounds, ranging from lo-fi and scratchy to pastoral and lush. Individually, they seem dissolute or even anxiety inducing, but by weaving in his own looping guitar it all builds towards something approaching harmony – or beauty. A bridge over troubled waters. <strong>Ed Yates, Knaresborough </strong></p> <h2>Morcheeba – Escape the Chaos</h2> <p>It’s a grand return to form with the standout tracks for me the Stone Roses-esque titled Elephant Clouds and the bullet train inspired, anthemic Hold It Down. But the whole LP (I continue to buy black gold from my local store) is a superb sonic renaissance that can match that of their Cool Britannia peers Pulp. Give it a spin, it’s equally chilled and funky, a perfect way to “escape the chaos”. <strong>Rudi Richter, Nuremberg, Germany </strong></p> <h2>Sharon Van Etten &amp; the Attachment Theory – Sharon Van Etten &amp; the Attachment Theory</h2>    <p>Sharon Van Etten’s work has always been emotionally cathartic, both for her and for us listeners; but I’ve always felt, much as I’ve always enjoyed her previous work, that something was being held back; but no more. Working with her new band and collaborators, the Attachment Theory, she has finally been fully let loose as a singer and communicator, and the results are staggering, moving, uplifting and devastating by turns. Her shows in the spring brought the new record vividly to life, and breathed new vital life into her existing material. Clearly these are the collaborators that she has always needed, and this record will undoubtedly be reckoned as one of the finest releases this year, as it would be in any year. <strong>Luke Dixon, London </strong></p>",

            "body" : "<p>The chief executive of Royal Mail has left after just over a year, weeks after the delivery company’s owner was sold for £3.6bn to a Czech billionaire.</p> <p>Emma Gilthorpe, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/02/royal-mail-heathrow-executive-next-ceo-emma-gilthorpe\">joined from Heathrow airport in May 2024</a>, left the company on Thursday, and will be replaced on an interim basis by the chief operating officer, Alistair Cochrane, with immediate effect, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Daniel Křetínský completed a deal to buy International Distribution Services (IDS), the owner of the 509-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/royal-mail\">Royal Mail</a>, in April.</p> <p>A group of existing IDS non-executive directors, including the chair, Keith Williams, resigned earlier this month. However, the company had made no mention of Gilthorpe’s future after the deal.</p> <p>She had been the chief operating officer at Heathrow airport since 2020, and joined Royal Mail in a newly created role under Martin Seidenberg, who is chief executive of IDS. Gilthorpe had also held positions in the telecoms industry, with BT and Cable &amp; Wireless.</p> <p>She said: “I will always be incredibly proud to have led Royal Mail … I look forward to seeing Royal Mail continue to transform in the years ahead, ensuring a stronger and more sustainable future for this great British company.”</p> <p>Cochrane joined Royal Mail in 2023 from the delivery company Whistl, where he was chief executive. He has also held senior roles at TNT Express and Parcelforce Worldwide.</p> <p>He becomes Royal Mail’s fourth boss in three years. Seidenberg, who had responsibility for the division before Gilthorpe was installed, replaced Simon Thompson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/12/royal-mail-boss-steps-down-after-bitter-dispute-with-unions\">stepped down</a> in 2023 after only two years following an acrimonious tussle with unions.</p> <p>Thompson had become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/12/is-running-royal-mail-the-most-impossible-job-on-the-ftse\">the latest in a line of executives</a> to clash with unions as they attempted to overhaul the company after its privatisation in 2013.</p> <p>Seidenberg said: “Emma has worked tirelessly to drive forward Royal Mail’s transformation, and I would like to extend my personal thanks to her for the significant contribution she has made to the company.”</p> <p>He added: “Alistair Cochrane is an exceptional leader and brings significant experience to his new role from across the logistics industry, and from his time with us at both Royal Mail and Parcelforce.”</p> <p>In May, the industry regulator, Ofcom, launched an investigation into Royal Mail’s quality of service after almost a quarter of first-class post last year arrived late. The target is for 93% of first-class items to arrive within one working day.</p> <p>Consumers and businesses have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/19/royal-mail-service-people-who-rely-on-postal-deliveries\">lamented the standard of service</a>, complaining about delivery delays and higher stamp prices. In April, the price of a first-class stamp rose by 5p, or 3%, to £1.70 – the sixth increase in little more than three years.</p> <p>Ofcom has been examining whether to relax rules on Royal Mail’s service, and has <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/post/royal-mail/protecting-the-postal-service-for-the-future\">proposed</a> allowing it to only deliver second-class letters on alternate weekdays and not on Saturdays, with first-class post remaining six days a week.</p> <p>Křetínský’s EP Group clinched the IDS deal after a long-running UK government review of the national security considerations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/16/royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky-uk-ids\">approved</a> the deal.</p> <p>The Conservative former trade policy minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/greg-hands\">Greg Hands</a> was this month appointed as a strategic adviser to EP Group.</p>",

<h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oIgr-fCWlg\"

></iframe> </figure>   <p>On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host spoke about the president considering a US military strike on Iran with “all options on the table”.</p> <p>Kimmel joked that for him that would mean “McDonald’s, Popeyes, Burger King, Domino’s and KFC”.</p> <p>The talk has meant that the Magaverse is “intensely divided” and with Trump still expressing unsureness, Kimmel said: “Who the hell knows what he’s gonna do?”</p> <p>A statement quoted Trump as saying that he will have an answer in two weeks. “For a guy whose catchphrase is ‘you’re fired’, no one has ever given more two weeks’ notice,” he said.</p> <p>While this week typically contains the longest day of the year, Kimmel joked that “every day is the longest day of the year” in 2025.</p> <p>The weather is set to be “unusually hot” in the US this summer, according to experts. “This is why the pope moved to Italy, it’s too hot,” he joked.</p> <p>This week also saw Americans celebrate Juneteenth, a national holiday to commemorate the end of slavery, although many on the right refused to join in. “We’re the ones who stopped enslaving, they should have a holiday for us!” Kimmel imagined them saying.</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJMa9rVi6cY\"

</figure>   <p>On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert called Juneteenth “a day of joy so Donald Trump doesn’t like it”.</p> <p>He spoke about Trump’s first executive order at the start of his second term, which demanded the dissolution of DEI, including a halt to all activities like Juneteenth.</p> <p>This week also saw RFK Jr’s health and human services department remove advice on daily drinking limits. “Vaccine shots are discouraged but tequila shots are not,” he said.</p> <p>Instead, a statement will recommend that Americans drink in moderation. “Yes, because that’s something Americans are great at: moderation,” Colbert joked.</p> <p>Like Kimmel, he also remarked that “this year the longest day has been every day” before speaking about Elon Musk, who has been “taking a break from destroying our government” to oversee the explosion of an unmanned starship rocket.</p> <p>He then moved on to Iran and spoke about Trump’s statement about waiting two weeks. “Two weeks’ notice is so important,” he said before comparing his remarks to “quitting your sales job at Best Buy”.</p> <p>Colbert said he’s probably “too distracted by the stuff he wants to destroy here”.</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJGRceWub98\"

</figure>   <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers spoke about people making comparisons between Trump and George W Bush.</p> <p>“Trump would not appreciate this comparison,” he said, showing footage of Trump criticising how Bush handled the Iraq war.</p> <p>But while many of his loyalists have “claimed the Bush era was over”, there are many similarities between the two.</p> <p>Meyers spoke about the hugely unpopular new bill that was recently pushed through with a large amount of Americans not in favour as it helps out richer citizens over the working class.</p> <p>He also spoke about Trump’s desire to start a “disastrous war in the Middle East” and expressed concern over the president not knowing what he is going to do. “You should know what you’re gonna do and we should also know!” he said.</p> <p>Meyers said that we are relying on the “whims of a single madman” over something so important.</p> <p>He also said we should be worried that Pete Hegseth is involved, playing footage of him talking about medical experiments where marbles are placed inside cat anuses.</p> <p>First, Meyers said, “Don’t kink-shame,” while also saying it sounds unlikely as “they barely let you pet their heads”.</p> <p>He also said that the Magaverse is “imploding because Trump betrayed everything he claimed to believe in”.</p>",

The other would commission the health secretary to report on the state of palliative care.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The cabinet was deeply split on the legisation.</strong> Cabinet ministers to join Starmer voting in favour included Rachel Reeves, Yvette Cooper, John Healey, Liz Kendall, Pat McFadden, Heidi Alexander, Ed Miliband, Steve Reed and Peter Kyle. Among those opposed were Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, Bridget Phillipson, Jonathan Reynolds, Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Darren Jones.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fa171f54-524a-446d-a1f1-a053777b8d16\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KFdCwHldfBA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Opening Friday’s debate, Leadbeater said that now was the moment to seize, to “correct the profound injustices of the status quo and to offer a compassionate and safe choice to terminally ill people who want to make it”. </strong>She said it was “not a choice between living and dying – it is a choice for terminally ill people about how they die”. She said rejecting the bill was “not a neutral act, it is a vote for the status quo … and it fills me with despair to think MPs could be here in another 10 years’ time hearing the same stories”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The former foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/james-cleverly\">James Cleverly</a>, who had opened the debate for opponents of the measure, said he was an atheist but had rejected the bill because, he said, the right safeguards were not in place. </strong>“We were promised the gold standard, a judicially underpinned set of protections and safeguards,” he said, citing concerns from professional bodies including the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Terminally ill people and families were in the public galleries watching the debate and at a rally in Parliament Square. But concerns were raised by disability activists, who held a protest outside parliament</strong>, and MPs opposed to the bill made passionate pleas that it would lead to people being coerced into ending their lives early.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Labour peer Charlie Falconer will take over shepherding the bill through the Lords</strong> and Leadbeater said she hoped it would receive royal assent by October.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Assisted dying supporters celebrated and thanked MPs for the “historic step”. </strong>Campaigners My Death, My Decision described the result as a “momentous victory for the overwhelming majority who support assisted dying”, but opposition campaigners said, after the vote, descibed the assisted dying bill as “deeply flawed and dangerous”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Hospices and end-of-life care professionals are now said to face “huge implications” after the assisted dying bill cleared the House of Commons. </strong>Ministers will have a year to report on how assisted dying could affect palliative care, if the assisted dying bill becomes law, as MPs called “aye” to approve Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson’s amendment 21.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A security review has been launched across the defence estate after pro-Palestinian activists broke into an RAF base and sprayed two military planes with red paint</strong>. Footage posted online by Palestine Action on Friday morning shows two people inside RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

More on this in a moment, but first here is a summary of the latest UK politics news:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Higher tax receipts were unable to prevent a rise in public sector borrowing in May to £17.7bn, up from £17bn a year earlier and the second highest for the month on record. </strong>A poll of City economists had forecast public sector net borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – would be £17.1bn.

The Italian coastguard said the recovery was scheduled to begin on Saturday morning.</p> <p>A spokesperson for TMC Maritime, which is conducting the recovery operation, said the vessel had been slowly raised from the seabed, 50 metres (165ft) down, over the past three days to allow the steel lifting straps, slings and harnesses to be secured under the keel.</p> <p>The operation – which has cost approximately $30m (£22m) - was made easier after the vessel’s 72-metre mast was detached using a remote-controlled cutting tool and placed on the seabed on Tuesday.</p> <p>The vessel will be transported to the port of Termini Imerese, where investigators are expected to examine it as part of an inquiry into the cause of the sinking. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/21/porticello-awaits-truth-bayesian-sinking-mike-lynch\">‘That damned night’: Porticello awaits the truth about Bayesian sinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Bayesian was anchored just offshore near the port of Porticello, in the province of Palermo, when it sank during a violent storm shortly before dawn on 19 August 2024.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/21/mike-lynch-was-ready-to-start-again-says-former-uk-cabinet-minister-john-gummer\">Lynch</a> had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/06/mike-lynch-fraud-trial-acquittal\">cleared two months earlier of fraud charges</a> in the US relating to the purchase of his company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/autonomycorporation\">Autonomy</a>, by Hewlett-Packard in 2011, and was enjoying a voyage around Sicily to celebrate with his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian.</p>    <p>The lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda, the banker Jonathan Bloomer and his wife, Judy, and the yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, were also killed when the vessel sank. Nine other crew members and six guests – including Bacares – were rescued.</p> <p>The salvage operation was very complex, and was temporarily suspended in mid-May after Rob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver, died during underwater work.</p> <p>The British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which oversaw a consortium of salvage specialists undertaking the project, said the hull would be lifted on to a specially manufactured steel cradle on the quayside once it had been transported to Termini Imerese.</p> <p>Investigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues to the causes of the sinking. A forensic examination of the hull will seek to determine whether one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.</p> <p>Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into suspected manslaughter. The boat’s captain, James Cutfield, from New Zealand, and two British crew members, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/two-more-crew-members-from-mike-lynch-yacht-under-investigation\">Tim Parker Eaton and Matthew Griffiths</a>, have been placed under investigation. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, this does not imply guilt or mean that formal charges will necessarily follow.</p> <p>According to a preliminary safety report released last month by the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch, the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds when running on its engine and that these “vulnerabilities” were “unknown to either the owner or the crew” as they were not included in the stability information book carried onboard.</p> <p>The MAIB said a possible “tornadic waterspout” headed towards the boats in the harbour. The docks seemed to divert the whirlwind, which went straight towards the Bayesian, and the vessel sank in the space of a few seconds.</p> <p>In September, Italian authorities requested additional security around the wreck of the Bayesian, after fears were raised that material in watertight safes onboard might be of interest to foreign governments.</p>",

            "body" : "<h2><strong>21 QUESTIONS</strong></h2> <p><em>Venganza</em> is on the cards in Trnava on Saturday night when England take on Spain at the European Under-21 Championship quarter-finals. There are constant reminders on the Channel 4 coverage in the UK that “we” are the holders, despite the fact there are only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/11/england-under-21s-euros-lee-carsley-james-mcatee-harvey-elliott\">a couple of remaining members</a> from the squad that defeated <em>La Rojita</em> in the final in Batumi two years ago. It’s a night that Oliver Skipp will never forget. There is another stark difference between then and now: England were properly decent at that point. This current crop have stumbled their way into the last eight like a weary boozer, six pints deep, picking his way through an All Bar One terrace on a hot day.</p> <p>Galavanting is not part of this England team’s repertoire; instead meekness is the summary of what they have offered. After a promising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/czech-republic-england-under-21-championship-match-reportv\">defeat of the Czech Republic</a>, they stumbled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/15/slovenia-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\">a goalless draw</a> against the might of Slovenia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/germany-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\">before losing to Germany B</a> in their final group game. Spain, on the other hand, have breezed to this stage, sweeping past Slovakia (3-2) and Romania (2-1). The more worrying news for England is that the Spanish are favourites and an inquisition should be expected. They’ve still got memories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/08/england-under-21-sink-spain-in-dramatic-final-to-become-european-champions\">Curtis Jones’s winner in Georgia two years ago</a>, although the more galling moment remains James Trafford making an injury-time penalty save from Abel Ruiz to secure the silverware for England. Revenge, it seems, is best served in a partially full stadium in Slovakia’s seventh biggest city.</p> <p>If we’re looking for positives out of the Germany game for England, then young Bournemouth midfield scurrier Alex Scott, who scored in the second half, was decent. He reckons it’s only a matter of time before the floodgates open for Carsley’s pups. “The lads score goals every single day but it’s not quite clicked yet in the games. The quality we have in this team, it’s a matter of time before the goals start flying in,” he whooped. They’ll need to win possession off the ball-hogging Spaniards before they can pepper the goal with shots. How will they do that, then? “Replicate what the lads did two years ago,” he mused. “It is going to be a tough team. Every Spain team is very good on the ball, very calm and composed.”</p> <p>In preparing to soften any blow, England need not worry, even if a hammering is handed out. Why? Because they have one of their own in Spain’s squad. Leeds United striker Mateo ‘Matty’ Joseph Fernández-Regatillo is leading the line despite possessing 10 England Under-20 caps. Born in Santander to an English father and Spanish mother, Joseph spent the first 19 years of his life in his homeland before being attracted by the bright lights of Yorkshire to learn about real football, none of that tiki-taka nonsense. Giving Joseph a proper football education might now backfire on England, but it does guarantee that at least one proud bulldog will make it to the semi-finals, whatever happens.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p>Join Taha Hashim for red-hot Copa Gianni updates from Flamengo 0-0 Chelsea at 7pm (BST).</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The American dream.

            "body" : "<p>The owners of James Bond have called the attempt by an Austrian businessman to take control of the superspy’s name across Europe an “unprecedented assault” on the multibillion-pound global franchise.</p> <p>In February, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/14/james-bond-in-battle-to-keep-hold-of-007-super-spys-name\">the Guardian revealed</a> that a Dubai-based property developer had filed claims in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various protections had lapsed around James Bond’s intellectual property, including his name, his 007 assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”.</p> <p>Nearly all of the nine trademarks being challenged relate to the merchandising of goods and services under the Bond name, which can be challenged after five years of “non-use”.</p> <p>Josef Kleindienst, an Austrian who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/13/not-end-the-world-return-dubai-ultimate-folly\">building a $5bn (£3.7bn) luxury resort complex</a> called the Heart of Europe on six artificial islands off Dubai, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/18/james-bond-wont-die-on-my-watch-says-austrian-who-wants-ownership-of-007\">argued the trademarks have been commercially underexploited</a>.</p> <p>Lawyers representing Danjaq, the US-based company which controls the rights to worldwide James Bond merchandising in conjunction with the UK-based production company Eon, have hit back, aiming to vigorously defend the 007 franchise.</p> <p>“James Bond is a trademark of the highest reputation in the EU,” said Rudolf Böckenholt at Boehmert &amp; Boehmert, one of the largest intellectual property (IP) law firms in Europe, representing Danjaq. “The trademarks are also licensed for numerous consumer products and merchandise products, ranging from very luxurious products to everyday products, as well as further services.”</p> <p>“These goods and the corresponding services are covered by a number of trademarks that have been challenged and attacked by the claimant Josef Kleindienst in an unprecedented assault,” he added.</p> <p>It has also emerged that Kleindienst has extended his attempt to try to take control of the spy’s various brands by also submitting his own trademark for James Bond in Europe.</p> <p>He has not, however, done the same in the UK.</p> <p>The European IP law firm Withers &amp; Rogers said this was likely to be because the “intention to use test” that applications were submitted to was more stringently applied by the UK’s Intellectual Property Office than its continental equivalent the EU Intellectual Property Office.</p> <p>“Danjaq would be more likely to object to the registration [in the UK] on the grounds of ‘bad faith’,” said Mark Caddle, a partner and trademark attorney at Withers &amp; Rogers.</p> <p>Danjaq’s lawyers are putting together evidence to prove the trademarks are still being commercialised, while at the same time arguing that Kleindienst’s “non-use” challenges “represent abuse of process”.</p> <p>Kleindienst was approached for comment.</p> <p>“The plot thickens,” Caddle said. “Opting for an ‘abuse of use’ defence suggests that Danjaq could believe that the cancellation attempt is not legitimate, and specifically, that the challenger may not be intending to use the marks commercially. While it is impossible to say for sure what the challenger’s motives are in this case, the James Bond trademark portfolio and its legacy value does make it an enticing target for opportunists, and further cancellation attempts can’t be ruled out.”</p> <p>Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/04/no-time-to-die-james-bond-movie-box-office-daniel-craig-007\">, No Time to Die</a>, was released in 2021 and with no announcement yet of his replacement or timeline for production of the next film, the franchise is on track to beat the previous longest gap between instalments of six years and four months.</p> <p>Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/26/amazon-buys-hollywood-studio-mgm-james-bond\">acquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021</a>. Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/21/stars-shaken-stirred-amazon-deal-james-bond\">paid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”</a> of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.</p> <p>With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spinoffs, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.</p> <p>In March, Amazon confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/25/amazon-james-bond-producers#:~:text=After%20rumours%20circulated%20online%2C%20Amazon,have%20cost%20around%20%241bn.\">Amy Pascal and David Heyman</a> would steer the next Bond film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named.</p> <p>Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series.</p> <p>Heyman is best known as the producer of the Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise and is now in pre-production on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/14/hbo-reveals-first-part-of-harry-potter-tv-cast-including-dumbledore-and-hagrid\">the HBO TV series adaptation of the stories</a>. He is the second most commercially successful film producer of all time, with credits including Gravity, Paddington, Barbie, Wonka and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.</p>",

I think we mean, how do we get the benefits of new digital technologies in the area of payments – where money is a medium of exchange?</p> <p>For instance, how do we get the benefits of smart contracts in payments, and the benefits of using digital technology to fight fraud? I start with the presumption that there should be benefit here – it seems like a failure of imagination if we think otherwise.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank has been investigating whether it should launch a new digital pound, dubbed “Britcoin”, which would be stored in digital wallets and interchangeable with cash and bank deposits.</p> <p><strong>Bailey</strong> argues that commercial banks “need to step up” to the challenge of digital money provision.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If there are real benefits to digital technology in payments, we should want to see them in commercial bank money. The buzzword here is tokenised deposits – a bit of a mouthful, but really it is the application of digital technology to the form of money that we have today. The challenge is to apply this to both domestic and cross-border and cross-border currency payments.</p> <p>To be clear, I am not against stablecoins, but they do have to meet the test of singleness of money. I am not against Central Bank Retail Digital Currency, but I question why it is needed if innovation proceeds as I think it should.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Tokenized deposits are digital tokens issued by regulated banks that represent claims on bank deposits. which allow bank account balances to be represented on a blockchain).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6855115f8f081eab3065a3e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-06-20T08:07:25.420Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Markets rise as Trump sets two-week window to decide on Iran attack</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets are rallying in early trading, after Donald Trump opened a two-week window for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Iran.</strong></p> <p>Last night’s news that Trump will decide in the next two weeks whether the U.S. will get involved in the Israel-Iran war has created some relief in the markets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/trump-iran-attack-plans-denial\">Trump denies approving Iran attack plan but will make decision ‘within two weeks’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Germany’s <strong>DAX</strong> share index is up almost 1%, and France’s <strong>CAC</strong> is 0.75% higher.</p> <p>In London, the <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> index has gained 44 points or 0.5%, with airline shares higher but oil companies falling.</p> <p>The price of Brent crude oil has dropped by 2.3% to $77 per barrel, as worries of US involvement in Middle East ease.</p> <p><strong>Neil</strong> <strong>Wilson</strong>, UK investor strategist at <strong>Saxo</strong> <strong>Markets</strong>, says some of the “geopolitical risk premia affecting global markets heading into the weekend” has diminished, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>European ministers are due to meet Iran’s foreign minister in Geneva today to hash something out.

Tax receipts were £82.5bn, also slightly below forecast, but there were signs the increase in employment taxes is feeding through into higher receipts as national insurance receipts exceeded the forecast. Crucially, the current budget deficit, which is now what matters for the fiscal rules, came in £0.2bn below the OBR forecast.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tighter fiscal policy could encourage the Bank of England to lower interest rates, after leaving borrowing costs unchanged yesterday <strong>Pugh</strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Looking ahead to the budget in the autumn, the under performance of the economy and higher borrowing costs mean the chancellor may already have lost the £9.9bn of fiscal headroom that she clawed back in March. Throw in the tough outlook for many government departments announced in the spending review and u-turns on welfare spending and the chancellor will probably have to announce some top-up tax increases after the summer.</p> <p>“We are pencilling in tax increases of £10-£20bn.

            "body" : "<p>The UK’s grocery industry watchdog has launched an investigation into Amazon over allegations that the retail and technology company is failing to pay its suppliers on time.</p> <p>The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) said it had “reasonable grounds” to suspect that Amazon had breached a part of the groceries supply code of practice, which mandates that there should not be delays in payments made to suppliers.</p> <p>The investigation into Amazon comes almost a year after the GCA told the online retailer it <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-must-swift-action-improve-114614459.html\">needed to take “swift and comprehensive action”</a> to improve its compliance with industry rules designed to protect suppliers.</p> <p>The GCA is responsible for regulating the relationships between the UK’s 14 largest grocery retailers – including the biggest supermarkets Tesco and Sainsbury’s – and their direct suppliers.</p> <p>The investigation into Amazon’s grocery retail arm is its third since the GCA was established in 2013 after inquiries into Tesco and the Co-op. The watchdog has the power to fine a company up to 1% of turnover if it is found to have broken the groceries code.</p> <p>The adjudicator, Mark White, said: “Delays in payment can significantly harm suppliers. The alleged delays could expose Amazon suppliers to excessive risk and unexpected costs, potentially affecting their ability to invest and innovate.”</p> <p>The company sells groceries in the UK through its Amazon Fresh branded stores and online retail operation, as well the Whole Foods chain, which it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/16/amazon-buy-whole-foods-market-organic-food-fresh\">bought in 2017 for $13.7bn</a> (£10.2bn).</p> <p>Suppliers raised <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66fd5d30080bdf716392ecf2/2024_GCA_conference_YouGov_slides.pdf\">more issues with Amazon than with other retailers</a>, according to a survey for the GCA carried out in 2024.</p> <p>After the warning to Amazon last July, the GCA said it had monitored the retailer’s actions and heard detailed evidence about suppliers’ experiences.</p> <p>The GCA said on Friday it had grounds to suspect Amazon had breached paragraph 5 of the groceries code between 1 March 2022 and 20 June 2025, but would focus its investigations on the period from the start of 2024 to gain the best understanding of Amazon’s current practices.</p> <p>The watchdog is calling on suppliers to send in evidence by 8 August. It added that all responses would remain confidential.</p> <p>The GCA said it had also received information about other issues at Amazon, adding that it would “not hesitate” to launch further investigations if required.</p> <p>It has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/05/tesco-faces-investigation-over-how-it-pays-suppliers\">reprimanded Tesco over its treatment of suppliers after a year-long investigation</a> but said it was not able to fine the supermarket chain because the alleged offences were committed before the government handed the GCA extra powers in 2015, allowing it to fine companies in 2015. It also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/co-op-investigated-treatment-suppliers-groceries-code-adjudicator\">investigated Co-op</a> in 2018.</p> <p>Amazon said it took “the groceries supply code of practice incredibly seriously” and added that it would “cooperate fully with the adjudicator”.</p> <p>The spokesperson said: “While we are disappointed with this decision, we welcome the opportunity to further demonstrate our ongoing compliance with this particular section of the code.<br><br>“We have already made significant improvements to our grocery supplier experience, including to payment practices, with supplier contacts on this reducing year-on-year.”<br><br>“We will continue to listen and work with our grocery suppliers as we roll out further changes.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Plans by French police to enter the sea to stop small boats carrying UK-bound asylum seekers willcause more deaths and be challenged in the European courts, a French charity has said.</p> <p>Arthur Dos Santos, the coordinator of the refugee charity Utopia 56, said there would be an increase in the number of people who would take “desperate” measures to reach the UK.</p> <p>The official, based in Calais, said the charity was examining the possibility of a legal challenge in the European courts to stop the tactics.</p> <p>Government sources have told the Guardian that French police would be authorised to tackle boats within 300 metres of the shore and in nearby waterways. </p> <p>The strategy aims to be ready in time for the Franco-British summit, which begins on 8 July. This coincides with the state visit to London of Emmanuel Macron, the French president.</p> <p>Over the past few days, French police have waded into the sea to stop asylum seekers from boarding boats, increasing speculation that police are already using the tactic.</p> <p>In one incident this week at Gravelines beach near Dunkirk, officers were shown waist-deep in water, using CS gas, riot shields and batons, as they attempted to force a boat to return to the beach.</p> <p>Dos Santos said the French plan to harden its tactics against asylum-seekers and smugglers would result in more deaths.</p> <p>“When police enter the sea, it will cause more deaths, more people will drown as they try to get away before being caught and forced back to the beach. There will be more violence, as some people fight back, and the people attempting to reach England will find other ways to try to get to the UK. This will not stop them, but it will make the crossings much more dangerous,” he said.</p> <p>The scheme is intended to give the French authorities the power to halt dinghies that “taxi” up to beaches from nearby waterways. Until now, guidelines prevent French police from intervening offshore unless it is to rescue passengers in distress. In practice, the policy means officers can stop boats leaving the beach by puncturing them, but are restricted once they are in the water.</p> <p>Dos Santos said the tactic would face legal challenges in the European courts, with lawyers examining human rights laws and the UN convention on the law of the sea.</p> <p>“This policy will be taken to the European courts. We will look very closely at this, as will other organisations,” he said.</p> <p>A British charity that operates in France told the Guardian two weeks ago it planed to explore possible legal challenges to stop the tactic.</p> <p>Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: “When the last Tory government tried to do pushbacks in the Channel, Care4Calais initiated a legal challenge and won. Any attempt to introduce interceptions in French waters must face the same level of resistance.”</p> <p>In 2024, 73 people died trying to cross the Channel in small boats, more than in the previous six years combined. Nine people this year have so far been reported dead or missing in the Channel.</p> <p>Nearly 17,000 people have crossed in small boats so far in 2025, according to Home Office figures, higher than at the same point in 2022, the overall record year for crossings. On Wednesday, Downing Street acknowledged that the situation in the Channel was “deteriorating”.</p> <p>The French police union Unity has expressed concern that officers could face legal action if people die during an intervention.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It’s an overcast Thursday morning, and photographer Simon Wheatley is doing a soft-shoe shuffle through Roman Road in Bow, east London, as a market stall blares out exquisite 70s funk. “That’s more like it,” he says, with a grin on his face. “A bit of energy.” This was once grime’s artery, its chaotic central hub, even its muse – a street Wiley once told me was “the nurturer” of local talents like him and Dizzee Rascal. And it was here, in the 2000s, that Wheatley would create a vivid and intimate document of grime in its frenzied flush of youth, and of working-class neighbourhoods like this before they became considerably more sedate. Fourteen years after the release of Don’t Call Me Urban, Wheatley’s long-sold-out photo-book from that era – once described by Vice as “grime’s Old Testament” – it is finally getting a rerelease, at almost double its original size.</p> <p>I have arranged to meet Wheatley outside the bougie Roman Road coffee shop that was once legendary grime record shop Rhythm Division. This leads to some confusion – there are simply too many bougie coffee shops in succession. “Back in the day it was absolutely thronging with people,” Wheatley recalls. “You’d turn a corner and down a sidestreet there’d be six guys doing an impromptu cipher [a freestyle MC-ing performance] – everywhere there were youths hanging out, wheeling around on their bikes, spitting over some tinny beat playing off a Nokia. This was the heartbeat of grime.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now artists like Stormzy are superstars, people forget that the first wave were treated as an underclass</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wheatley became grime’s documentarian simply by walking out of his front door in Limehouse when he was “just a broke photographer” in his 20s, and daring to take an interest in his young neighbours. He did so at a time when the media and MPs were condemning the same kids as delinquent “hoodies” or “chavs” – as if they were somehow morally culpable for the social problems they were enduring. Photographing rising underground artists for Black music magazine RWD gave Wheatley his “hood pass”, with now-famous images such as Roll Deep’s “ice-cream van” shoot, Skepta in a chip shop, Crazy Titch and his terrifying dog, Dizzee in the studio, Kano dressed as Scarface, or Tinchy Stryder and his crew Ruff Sqwad when they were still in school.</p>    <p>Those shoots opened the door – although some suspected he was an undercover cop when he first showed up. “I remember [Roll Deep’s] DJ Target invited me to the When I’m ‘Ere video shoot, and I saw this gaggle of youngsters hanging about, looking at me suspiciously. I realised that there was a whole world to uncover, with their lives.”</p> <p>Over time, he won the trust of his subjects. It helped, he thinks, that he is a “a bit of an odd case, a bit of a weirdo” – an outsider among outsiders. Wheatley insinuated himself into the pirate radio studios and youth clubs that provided the DIY launchpads for so much talent. He shot not just microphone clashes and radio sessions but fights, drug deals, hectic street-corner tableaux and intimate domestic moments; teenagers watching TV, daydreaming, having breakfast, rolling spliffs, writing out lyrics longhand, doing each other’s hair.</p> <p>“For me, the texture of grime is there in the real world,” Wheatley says. “It’s there on the estate, or in the radio stations at 2 o’clock in the morning, where some deeply underground crew would have a slot – the bin bag in the corner overflowing with fast food boxes and drink cans, Rizla packets and rave flyers scattered everywhere.” Don’t Call Me Urban is a social document of youthful energy, boredom, angst and joy, as much as it captures a generation of musicians on their way to fame and fortune.</p>    <p>“I always felt that grime was a reflection of that post-Thatcherite social breakdown,” Wheatley continues. “It was that very coarse expression of a kind of individualism.” The paradox is that it was also “very much about the community”, about mates looking out for each other when nobody else would. He is defensive of the bright, creative young people who went on to change the face of UK music, some of whom have become his close friends; I have been with Wheatley while he buys nourishing groceries for a hungover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/06/singer-songwriter-hak-baker-the-old-guard-is-being-priced-out-of-london\">Hak Baker</a>, the charismatic singer-songwriter Wheatley was shooting in 2006, when he was a 14-year-old MC called Swift Leng.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was this angst-ridden reflection of youth culture on the streets. That’s what gripped me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Now artists like Stormzy are superstars, people forget that the first wave were treated as an underclass,” Wheatley says. “Grime now is just regarded as a musical genre, rather than a sociological phenomenon. But it was both of those things: an incredible sound, but also this angst-ridden reflection of youth culture on the streets. That’s what gripped me, and that’s what I really went hard after, chasing.”</p> <p>At times, this chase would lead him into sketchy situations, with people pulling out long blades at pirate stations (also caught on camera), and the police rarely far away. One night, he found himself in the middle of an empty field by the Docklands Light Railway, shooting a pre-arranged fight – football hooligan style – between boys from the E3 and E14 postcodes. Some of them weren’t wildly impressed when his flash went off.</p>    <p>“That was very early on in my grime experience. Naivete has always been my greatest shield,” he laughs. “I didn’t really know what I was doing half the time, or where I was going. Crazy Titch said recently: ‘Simon was so brave.’ I wasn’t brave; I just didn’t know!” Wheatley’s mentor was Philip Jones Griffiths, the late war photojournalist, and as a photojournalist himself, Wheatley has taken deliberate risks – going through military roadblocks in Chiapas, Mexico, disguised as a peasant while on the trail of the Zapatistas in the late 1990s, or plunging into the Paris banlieues during the 2005 riots.</p> <p>He is a physically dynamic photographer, well-suited to capturing the restless, fidgety energy of teenagers. “I was a sports fanatic as a teenager,” he says, demonstrating some capoeira moves, “and photography replaced sport for me as a passion. I can’t really teach photography, but I can teach martial arts: I teach a combination of capoeira Angola mixed with yogic breathing and tai chi. I also fast before I shoot, just for a few hours, so my senses are sharper.”</p>    <p>First published in 2011, Don’t Call Me Urban was quickly out of print and in demand, its price soaring on resale sites as the genre exploded into the mainstream. “It became almost like a relic that was appreciated by the connoisseurs of the culture, and it became this cult book,” he says – both as a rare visual document of Black British music heritage, and a source of creative inspiration. One of those connoisseur-fans is Clint Ogbenna (known as Clint 419), founder of streetwear clothes brand Corteiz, who turned one of Wheatley’s famous shots of Crazy Titch into a jacket, and gave Wheatley the push and financial support to finally rerelease the book.</p> <p>As well as providing a unique document of grime in its heyday, Wheatley’s work is a valuable visual record of every day life in east London, before the 2012 Olympics arrived and changed it beyond recognition. He is keen to avoid fetishising the pre-gentrification city: “Who’s to say all those changes are bad?” he asks. “I’m sure some people are happy their flats have been refurbished. But artistically, texturally, there was something very gripping about a run-down block in a state of disrepair – it almost felt as if it was abandoned to the youth, to make their playground of hope, frustration and despair. There was much more atmosphere – nowadays everything is a bit cleaner.”</p> <p>• The expanded edition of Don’t Call Me Urban!

            "body" : "<p>Alfred Brendel would have scorned the suggestion he was the world’s leading pianist. He would have dismissed such an accolade as banal, journalistic and ignorant. He would, of course, have been right. Piano playing, he once said, was never sufficient, even when it was faultless.</p> <p>Yet, for a generation of musicians, especially in Britain, where he lived the second half of his long life, this dismissal of his own greatness could itself be dismissed as false modesty. When London’s Royal Festival Hall, still at that time the capital’s most cherished classical music large venue, reopened after a long renovation in 2007, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/18/classicalmusicandopera.reviews\">the choice of its first recitalist was a no-brainer</a>. For his legions of admirers, Brendel was always the one.</p> <p>He was the pianist whose recitals they would never miss, the one whose recordings they felt came closest to definitiveness, and he was the artist whose performances seemed unmatched in their objectivity, balance and colour, seriousness and depth. For the listeners of his era, he was, quite simply, the pianist of pianists.</p> <p>Brendel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/17/celebrated-pianist-and-writer-alfred-brendel-dies-aged-94\">who died this week</a> at his London home at the age of 94, was never best known for his piano pyrotechnics. In performance, he eschewed glitz. While some keyboard virtuosi of earlier times have been noted for their performance mannerisms – Horowitz wiping the piano keys with his handkerchief in mid-performance, Rubinstein playing to the gallery with his exaggerated arm movements – Brendel was straight-backed, concentrated, almost severe.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA8m1QPv1yQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gA8m1QPv1yQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>That was the deal. It was the music, not his personality, that the audiences came to hear. Brendel’s technique was of the highest order, but it was always at the service of the music and the listener, not of his own reputation. His piano sound was rich but never overdone, his readings authoritative but never pompous. His performances always had a well-articulated shape and direction, but they were made up of a thousand small choices and touches about phrasing, contrast and tone. He was never an obviously fast player, but as a listener it was hard to keep up with the cascade of detail that always underpinned the whole.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I once encountered him walking purposefully across Hampstead Heath, carrying a brand new blue bucket. </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He was known for his authority in the works of the Austro-German masters – Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert in particular – all of them reliable public favourites. As he grew older, his programmes rarely strayed far beyond this Viennese canon, though Haydn, Liszt and Schoenberg were always important to him too. Chopin and Schumann became increasingly rare inclusions.</p> <p>But Brendel was not, as some insist, the last upholder of the central European piano tradition. For one thing, he always kept up with contemporary music. He revered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/harrison-birtwistle-utterly-distinctive-music-of-delicate-beauty-andrew-clements\">Harrison Birtwistle</a>. When the Guardian was looking for a new chief music critic in the early 1990s, it was he who recommended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewclements\">Andrew Clements</a> for the job on the grounds of his commitment to new music.</p> <p>He saw himself as a cosmopolitan who had simply ended up in the UK (he had a house in Hampstead and another in Dorset). Yet the fact that he chose to live here was undeniably flattering, and the compliment was repaid by the fierce and almost reverential loyalty of British audiences. As with Yehudi Menuhin from an earlier generation, and Daniel Barenboim during his young adulthood, Britain embraced Brendel with undisguised affection.</p> <p>He was always interested in listening to other musicians, which is more than can be said for all soloists. One sometimes saw him at other pianists’ recitals, notably those of the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/24/maurizio-pollini-obituary\">Maurizio Pollini</a>, and of former pupils including <a href=\"https://www.paullewispiano.co.uk/\">Paul Lewis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imogen-cooper.com/\">Imogen Cooper</a>. His collaborations with singers were rare, but those of us who heard him accompanying Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Schubert’s Winterreise cycle (on the stage at Covent Garden in 1985) were rewarded with a partnership of equals.</p> <p>Piano playing was, of course, the thing he did best and which gave him his fame and his income. But it was only ever one part of his very varied and even eclectic cultural life. Brendel had a vast and individual intellectual hinterland. He was a <a href=\"https://alfredbrendel.com/books.php\">writer</a>, a poet and a painter as well as a musician, a teacher, a public intellectual and a man of wide sensibilities.</p>    <p>He was famously a lover of the absurd. His poetry showed the influence of the Munich nonsense writer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christian-Morgenstern\">Christian Morgenstern</a>, while his cultural writing sometimes echoed the great Viennese critic <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/154719.Karl_Kraus\">Karl Kraus</a>. Although he was not himself Viennese (he was born in the northern Moravian part of present-day Czechia), the Austrian capital drew him in, not merely because he played so much music by Vienna-based composers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/19/alfred-brendel-vienna\">Vienna was the city where he chose to give his farewell concert</a> in 2008 – he played Mozart’s early E flat piano concerto K271.</p> <p>At his home, Brendel had a drawing of a pianist laughing fit to burst in a concert hall filled with intense and serious listeners. This may explain why there was always something both of the undertaker and the clown in his platform appearance. I never met him socially but, while wheeling one of my children in a buggy one winter’s day, I once encountered him walking purposefully across Hampstead Heath, carrying a brand new blue bucket with its price tag attached. Why the bucket? Where could he be taking it? He grinned as we passed one another. Perhaps it was just another private joke. But it seemed, now as it did back then, to embody the duality of the remarkable artist we have just lost.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>She was a seaside landlady who left school at 14 and who, without any formal training, became one of Britain’s most popular artists. Now, 17 years after Beryl Cook’s death, her home city of Plymouth will this week announce a major exhibition that will include previously unseen works as well as much-loved humorous paintings with larger-than-life characters.</p> <p>Cook was chronically shy and avoided her exhibition openings – and would probably have stayed away from the show at <a href=\"https://www.theboxplymouth.com/\">The Box</a> from January 2026. </p> <p>Spanning her entire career, it will feature loans from private and public owners, including her family. It will explore her significance in portraying “ordinary people enjoying themselves”, with both comedy and compassion.</p> <p>Among the paintings that have not been publicly exhibited before is Bingo, in which a woman in a bingo hall has just won a game, raising her hand in glee as a nearby woman gives her a classic Cook side-eye.</p> <p>It was acquired last year by The Box, whose collections include a film and television archive, on which its curator, Terah Walkup, has drawn, linking Cook’s images to actual places.</p> <p>She has, for example, identified the Plymouth bingo hall and the exact moment of inspiration for Bingo: “It was from a news clip on local television about the popularity of bingo. In one scene, a woman throws her hands up in the air celebrating a winning card, while women behind her cast a side-eye …</p> <p>“Beryl had a notoriously photographic memory, so it could have been that she remembered this particular scene or seeing it on the local television. It changes the way that we might think about this classic humorous work. </p> <p>“This particular film clip wasn’t just about bingo halls. It was actually about the sociability of older women. It was about how women found space in order to meet each other, socialise, spend money and have a sense of independence in the 1980s.”</p>    <p>The artist had in fact worried that her caricatures would offend the real-life people who had inspired them, according to her daughter-in-law, who in the early 1970s lived in the basement of Cook’s modest terrace house on the Hoe.</p> <p>Teresa Cook told the Guardian: “She did worry to start with. She was nervous. Actually, that’s why the fan letters helped so much. People can recognise themselves or they feel they’ve seen somebody that looks like that … Beryl realised that there was no offence in the art and people were genuinely so happy to see her art.”</p> <p>Sophie Cook, the artist’s granddaughter, said that because the caricatures were never cruel, “people loved being in the paintings.”</p> <p>Recalling an earlier exhibition, she said: “The major comment from every staff member was the laughter that everyone could hear … You can be having a bad day, you go and have a look at a Beryl Cook exhibition and I guarantee your day just got better.”</p>    <p>She spoke of a new fanbase for Cook’s art, that the family receives correspondence from people – particularly young people – who love it.</p> <p>The family hopes it is only a matter of time before the Tate shows her properly. Despite her popularity with the public, the gallery’s former director declared in 1996 that “there will be no Beryl Cooks in Tate Modern,” although she was in a 2010 group show at Tate Britain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/commentisfree/article/2024/may/21/beryl-cook-paintings-fat-bodies-fatphobia\">If we can respect fat bodies in Beryl Cook’s paintings, why can’t we do so in the street? | Lisette May Monroe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Julian Spalding, former director of galleries in Sheffield, Manchester and Glasgow, criticised modern art museums “who wouldn’t go near Beryl with a barge pole, even though part of their job is preserving art history”.</p> <p>In his 2023 book Art Exposed, he argued: “Beryl’s work merits a place in any public collection.”</p> <p>He was among her earliest fans, after seeing her painting of two weary middle-aged women in a museum cafe, “easing their sore ankles out of the pinching heels of their shoes, with blissful relief spreading across their faces”. </p> <p>He observed: “No troubling art to look at any more, just a cup of tea and a seat. What an earthy response to a gallery visit … She was, I thought, a genuine artist of our time.”</p> <p>Teresa Cook said: “She did a few paintings of me, and I loved them all.”</p> <p>They include Elvira’s Café, about which Cook once said: “This is a picture of my son and daughter-in-law’s cafe, in which they serve sausage sandwiches, amongst other things … Here you see one about to be tackled by the lady in front, with Teresa enjoying the view she had of one of the many handsome marines who frequent the cafe, for they are stationed in barracks just around the corner. In the summer they sometimes arrive in sporting gear, like this vest and tiny shorts.”</p> <p>Walkup noted that the Tate had been supportive of this exhibition: “This is the most extensive exhibition of Beryl Cook’s work to date, a landmark show.</p> <p>“It’s all about recasting Beryl’s career and showing that she’s quite radical, particularly to do with identity and representation. Beryl was painting those who have been overlooked by society.”</p> <p>The exhibition draws on Cook’s previously unpublished letters. In one, she wrote: “Instead of doing housework, I go upstairs and start painting.”</p>",

A new study shows a clear path to addressing this scourge and saving kids’ lives: state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gun-control\">gun control</a> laws.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2834530\">study</a>, published this month in Jama Pediatrics, reveals that states which enacted stricter gun control measures following the 2010 <a href=\"https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/second-amendment/the-supreme-court-the-second-amendment/#:~:text=In%20McDonald%20v.,addition%20to%20the%20federal%20government.\">McDonald v Chicago</a> supreme court ruling – a landmark decision that struck down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago\">Chicago</a>’s ban on handguns and, in effect, expanded the second amendment nationwide – have seen a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children aged up to 17. By contrast, states that expanded gun freedoms have seen a notable increase in kids’ deaths from gun violence, including by homicide, by suicide and from accidents.</p> <p>This means that commonsense gun policies make a difference when it comes to keeping kids safe, said Nick Suplina, senior vice-president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “This study sends a message that lawmakers that refuse to take action or who further loosen gun laws are putting kids’ lives in peril,” he said. “That’s a very powerful outcome for an academic study.”</p> <p>To conduct their study, researchers divided states into three categories – least permissive, more permissive and most permissive – based on the strength of their gun control laws. They then used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to look into individual states’ rates of pediatric firearm deaths (deaths from gun violence among children ages 0-17) over a 12-year span.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/colorado-social-media-bill\">They hoped their children’s deaths would bring change. Then a Colorado bill to protect kids online failed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What they found was a striking degree of overlap among states based on legislation enacted. In more permissive states, such as Mississippi and New Hampshire, pediatric death rates rose substantially more than expected, especially among children of color. “[We saw] so many excess deaths over and above what would have been expected,” said Jeremy Faust, an emergency room physician and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, and the study’s lead author.</p> <p>But in states that passed stricter laws – such as background checks, permitting and safe-storage requirements – rates either stayed stagnant or fell. That finding surprised Faust, who anticipated that every state would see at least some increase since the number of kids killed by guns in the US has <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/06/gun-deaths-among-us-kids-rose-50-percent-in-two-years/\">risen so sharply over the past decade</a>.</p> <p>California, New York and Maryland, all of which have assault weapon bans and safe-storage laws, saw decreased rates of pediatric firearm mortality. And Rhode Island, which requires would-be gun owners to pass a firearm safety course to buy a handgun, saw a 60% drop in gun-related deaths among children.</p> <p>“These deaths are not inevitable,” said Shriya Bhat, a second-year molecular biology student at Harvard and an author of the study. “Policy choices matter, and we can learn from the places that have kept kids safer.”</p> <p>Gun policy experts say that research like this, which treats gun violence as a public health concern and considers the impact of on-the-books legislation from a scientific perspective, is desperately needed. “The insights of the medical community are vital to educating policymakers and the public about the need to address the public health crisis fueled by unregulated access to firearms,” said Nick Wilson, senior director for gun violence prevention at the Center for American Progress. (The White House recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/trump-removes-gun-violence-public-health-advisory\">removed</a> former surgeon general Vivek Murthy’s advisory on gun violence as a public health issue, and has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/trump-gun-violence-federal-programs\">slashed funding</a> for gun violence research.)</p> <p>Experts also stress the need for lawmakers to translate knowledge into action. That means prioritizing measures that keep all of society safe from gun violence, such as universal background checks, as well as laws that protect kids specifically, such as safe-storage regulations. “We really need policymakers to step up,” said Kelly Drane, research director at the Giffords Law Center.</p> <p>Suplina added that moving the needle on policy would require dampening the influence of the country’s for-profit gun lobby, which perpetuates the narrative that guns make a society safer – a myth he hopes this study can help dispel. “Literally the exact opposite is true,” he said. “If more guns made us safer, the US would be the safest country in the world by far. Instead, we have a homicide rate that’s 25 times that of our peer nations.”</p> <p>But a lack of gun control legislation doesn’t mean individuals can’t change their own behaviors to keep kids safe. Parents who own guns can safely store their firearms and ask other parents whether there are guns in the house before permitting a playdate, said Drane, much like a parent might ask if another family has a fence around their pool. “It doesn’t have to be a conversation about whether or not it’s OK to own firearms, but just knowing that there’s a plan in place to keep kids safe in the home is really important.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, researchers and experts are hopeful that political gulfs can be crossed by focusing on how policies can save the lives of children. “We’ve seen a lot of public health successes that have been bridged by focusing on the impact of public health threats on children,” said Drane. “I’m hopeful that research like this can help change minds.”</p> <p>For Faust, who witnessed children die from gunshot wounds first-hand while training in a Queens, New York, trauma center, addressing the epidemic of gun violence is deeply tied to his work as a physician.</p> <p>“I am interested in how choices we make as a society can have a massive impact on the way we live and die,” he said. “When you save the life of a kid, think about the decades of life you are giving back.”</p>",

It turns out the guy who operates the radioactively toxic gossip forum is a “vegan influencer” – I think it’s one of those new types of job, dear – and his name is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jun/17/operator-of-gossip-forum-tattle-life-unmasked-after-losing-defamation-case\">Sebastian Bond</a>. From that professional description, Sebastian would never hurt a living creature – unless it’s a mummy blogger, in which case he would gut her like a pig. Metaphorically, of course! Sorry, but that is simply the price you pay for not declaring the nappies you’re unboxing on Instagram are actually sponsored.</p> <p>But I’m racing ahead. If you’re not familiar with Tattle Life, it’s an online forum that claims to be “a commentary website on public business social media accounts” – much in the way the torpedoing of the Lusitania was a commentary on the commercial cruise business. At one point Tattle Life was said to have 12 million monthly visitors. Which, to put it into context, is <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/media-audience-and-business-data/media_metrics/most-popular-websites-news-uk-monthly-2/\">more than the Times and Sunday Times website</a> gets, and considerably surpasses the visitor numbers of something like GB News. The other thing Tattle Life says about itself on its homepage is: “We have a zero-tolerance policy to any content that is abusive, hateful or harmful.” This is a little bit like the Racing Post saying it has a zero-tolerance policy for stories about horses, greyhounds or sports betting.</p> <p>In effect, Tattle Life comprises a pulsating collection of live threads, in which anonymous users spend their lengthy wine time ignoring their own kids in order to obsessively tear down Stacey Solomon for some infinitesimal perceived mistake she’s made with hers that day. That’s it, Tattlers – you crack open another chilled box of rosé and remorselessly slag off, dox or expose this or that influencer/Instagrammer/minor rando for infringements of a code of which you’re the self-appointed enforcers. And if you don’t like that description of yourselves, boohoo. What, NOW you want accuracy and restraint?</p> <p>Anyway, the site has been positively thriving like this for some years, despite regular petitions to take it down and frequent outpourings of distress from celebrities, sublebrities and whatever the class of recognition below even that is, many of whom believe it has either destroyed their professional lives and/or mental health, or had an incredibly good go at trying. Two such victims were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cglereg755xo\">Neil and Donna Sands</a>, a Northern Irish couple with a clothing line and various other small businesses. Donna discovered she had been targeted by site users in 2021, when a friend alerted her to the fact that people in her office were laughing over a 45-page thread about her. Forty-five pages! I guess no snowflake in an avalanche feels responsible.</p> <p>The deranged interest/abuse continued, to the point of posting her whereabouts at any given time, and drove Donna almost to the point of nervous breakdown. The pair sued Tattle Life for defamation and, after a long and complex battle, won. They were awarded a combined £300,000 in damages as well as costs – now estimated to total about £2m. But who was to pay? Tattle Life was run anonymously, and it was only a week ago that the high court of justice in Northern Ireland <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/donna-neil-sands-sebastian-bond-tattlelife-6734991-Jun2025/\">lifted various reporting restrictions and orders</a>, leading to one Sebastian Bond being exposed as the operator of the site.</p> <p>Many think the floodgates to further legal action will now open, but whatever Tattle Life’s fate, it’s interesting as a period piece. The site sprang up in an era when fame came to be regarded as a grasping business decision and not as a cultural accolade. Anyone who made money in the public eye was fair game for anything. And look, no one likes a grift, we can all have sympathy for people who feel they’re being missold something or other, and most of us would fear the Faustian bargain of explicitly monetising our personal lives, let alone our children. But the elevation of even tiny bits of poetic licence by individuals most people have never heard of to the level of massive consumer fraud is mad – and says so much more about the self-styled cops of our age than the robbers.</p> <p>In the end, investigators got Bond via his own site’s preferred methods – obsessively tracking his public digital footprint, piecing together bits of often contradictory information, searching for chinks in his armour. The biter was bit. And, would you believe, Sebastian had pretended to be a woman on Tattle. Went by the name of Helen McDougal. “I was just not surprised that it was a man pretending to be a woman,” <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14820495/tattle-life-troll-sand-neil-donna.html\">Donna Sands told the Mail</a> this week, “and pitting these women against each other – driving them to their darkest places.”</p> <p>So where is Sebastian Bond now? Some reports place him in Thailand, while others ran pictures of his parents’ nice house in Somerset. As for <em>who</em> he is … he’s a man posing as a woman in the course of drawing profit, an individual dedicated to exposure who didn’t have the nuts to reveal himself, a grifter who’d rather vanish than face his own music. In fact, so vast is the disconnect between who Sebastian really is and who he presented as for his moneymaking activities that there really ought to be hundreds of skin-flayingly vicious threads about him on Tattle Life. And yet, needless to say, there aren’t.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The centre-back, who is currently representing England at the European Under-21 Championship, is valued at more than £30m by the Anfield club. Quansah made his first-team debut early in Jürgen Klopp’s final season in charge and performed so well that he ended the campaign as a regular starter alongside Virgil van Dijk. But the 22-year-old struggled for minutes under Arne Slot last season and now appears poised to move to Germany.</p> <p>Liverpool could replace Quansah with the Crystal Palace captain, Marc Guéhi.

Great artworks jostle for space on the walls – Picasso, Velázquez, a handful of impressionists, and a banner reads “Happy birthday boss”. Guests pour in from a pinging elevator: a maelstrom of big skirts in Disney princess colours, high-rise hair, three-piece suits and pork pie hats. Out of the window: skyscrapers.</p> <p>In singer turned director <a href=\"https://www.johnsavournin.com/\">John Savournin</a>’s latest production for Opera Holland Park – a collaboration with Scottish Opera and D’Oyly Carte Opera – Franz Lehár’s hit operetta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/02/classicalmusicandopera1\">The Merry Widow</a> switches fictional Pontevedro and <a href=\"https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/le-gai-paris.483092/\">Le Gai Paris</a> for New York’s mafia underworld and its Sicilian homeland. The plot’s patriarch becomes a pinstripe Manhattan godfather, title character Hanna Glawari the widow of a Sicilian lemon-tree racketeer.</p> <p>In their energetic English version, Savournin and David Eaton have fun with Dolmio-level Italian (no less authentic than Lehár’s original Balkan Neverland) and these mafiosi reach as often for the TV gangster phrase book – “Bada bing, bada boom”, “schmuck”, “capeesh?” – as for their guns. Dialogue is delivered in 90% faux mafioso (“family comes foist, bowss!”), 10% operatic RP. In the mostly excellent singing those proportions were reversed. And where the spoken passages were largely shrieked or shouted, the balance in the sung numbers swung in favour of the orchestra: most of the action played behind the pit thus vastly increasing the demands on singers already working in tent-acoustics.</p>    <p>So much high-camp melodrama may leave some yearning for a calmer take on Lehár’s classic. But, for those with a higher tolerance for hyperactive kitsch and national stereotyping after Lehár’s own model, this mid-century Merry Widow is enormously enjoyable. Come for the big tunes, stay for the straight-legged “Russian” folk dance performed unsmiling in dark glasses, the stage hands in white tie, lemon trees on wheels and the “birthday cement mixer” (don’t ask). For Acts 2 and 3, <a href=\"https://takis.design/\">takis</a>’s streamlined set spins to take us from a cypress-equipped villa to the crimson interior of Maxim’s – now a “respectable performance bar” in New York.</p> <p>Bass-baritone <a href=\"http://www.grovesartists.com/artist/henry-waddington/\">Henry Waddington</a> is ideally cast as “Don” Zeta and evidently had a ball, his comic timing impeccable; <a href=\"https://www.atholestill.com/artist/rhian-lois/\">Rhian Lois</a> was a vivacious stage presence as his wife, Valentina. Matthew Kellett’s Little Italy accent was the best of the bunch, while Christopher Nairne and Connor James Smith made one winning double act as warring Italians, <a href=\"https://amyjpayne.com/\">Amy J Payne</a> and <a href=\"https://www.matthewsiveter.co.uk/\">Matthew Siveter</a> as another, the ferocious “Russian” Kromows. But this is also a piece with a big heart. Along with the warm, stylish playing from the orchestra of Scottish Opera under <a href=\"https://www.rayfieldallied.com/artists/stuart-stratford\">Stuart Stratford</a>, it was the suavity and occasional tenderness of <a href=\"https://www.atholestill.com/artist/alex-otterburn/\">Alex Otterburn</a>’s Danilo and <a href=\"https://www.paulasides.com/\">Paula Sides</a>’s Hanna that made this performance more than the sum of its gags.</p> <p>• At <a href=\"https://operahollandpark.com/productions/the-merry-widow-2025/\">Opera Holland Park, London</a>, until 28 June.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>There is abundant charm, humour and a pointed sense of play fuelling Femi Elufowoju Jr’s musical drama re-centring the narratives around Africa. Its charisma is reminiscent of his previous rollicking production at this venue, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/14/the-secret-lives-of-baba-segis-wives-review-arcola-london\">The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives</a>, which featured some of the same actors.</p> <p>This is not as successful, despite its infectiousness. Ultz’s set design is loose, initially bearing a coffin at its centre. The premise is that 11 travellers must embark on a quest across all 54 nations in Africa within a week, spurred on by ancestral mother Mama Africa (Suzette Llewellyn). It is not altogether clear what will happen if they fail despite the symbolic coffin; the play does not dwell on raising the stakes. The job of the characters is to “demystify and justify” the continent.</p> <p>Based on writer-director Elufowoju’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jun/13/femi-elufowoju-jr-theatre-5460-africa-arcola-theatre-london\">own travels</a>, the collective odyssey encompasses personal, political, social and even environmental history along with myth and ideas around belonging. Spoken scenes are accompanied by interludes of exuberant song and dance. The performers are always entertaining: Munashe Chirisa oozes comic talent as a shopkeeper in Uganda and a traffic warden in Seychelles; Liana Cottrill is an astounding dancer; The Ganda Boys (Denis Mugagga and Daniel Sewagudde) weave music around scenes; while<strong> </strong>Elufowoju, following an illness in the cast, does a fine job of reading a part.</p> <p>We briefly hear about the colonial history of Cameroon and at one passport control, an officer challenges a traveller’s dual African/British identity. We sweep reverentially into Robben Island, briefly stopping inside Nelson Mandela’s former cell, and push through to Tunisia and a bristling encounter in Libya.</p> <p>Sometimes it is hard to work out what is happening. Scenes are often brief – giving little time to connect with characters – and heavy-handed in their messages. The drama feels baggy and more like sketches or riffs that contain little tension, story or characterisation. Maybe it is a deliberate endeavour to disrupt or diverge from a – western? – dramatic narrative so it is not led by these traditional elements.</p> <p>What takes their place is joyful but broad-brush, maybe too ambitious in what it is trying to achieve. Where it shares the same inventive staging and bubbling joy as The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives, there is little of its magnificent storytelling, despite the 11 adventuring storytellers.</p> <p>• At the <a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/54-60-africa/\">Arcola theatre, London</a>, until 12 July</p>",

It is working closely with police and counter terrorism officers investigating the incident, a spokesperson added.</p> \n<p>Brize Norton in Oxfordshire is the largest airbase in the UK, employing more than 6,000 people, and is home to the UK’s refuelling fleet. One of the Voyager aircraft, now repainted with a British flag on its tailfin, is used to fly the king and the prime minister on official engagements.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the video, a plane with the union flag tailfin livery can be seen in the distance on the tarmac.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said a full security review was under way and that it would encompass the entire defence estate. A spokesperson said the police would take “all necessary steps to investigate and prosecute”.</p> \n<p>Palestine Action said the intruders used repurposed fire extinguishers to spray red paint into the turbines of the two planes and attacked them with crowbars. Paint, symbolising bloodshed, was also sprayed on the runway, and a Palestinian flag was left at the scene, as shown in the footage.</p> \n<p>A defence source said the attack was based on a misconception. The UK does not provide refuelling to support Israeli military operations, the person said. Two aircraft were being checked for damage and no planned flights or operations were affected, they added.</p> \n<p>RAF Voyagers were used in April to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/uk-yemen-airstrikes-houthi-rebels\">Typhoon jets bombing Houthi rebels</a> near Sana’a in Yemen during the recent US-led Operation Rough Rider campaign against the group. The Houthis support Iran and Hamas, though the attack was in response to the Yemeni group’s attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/20/israel-iran-war-live-updates-geneva-talks-trump-khamenei-latest-news\">Israel-Iran war live: foreign ministers from Europe and Iran to hold talks as US says it is still deciding whether to join war</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Airbases and planes stationed on the ground are considered softer military targets, as demonstrated by Ukraine’s recent Operation Spider’s Web drone raid on grounded Russian aircraft. But it is a surprise that it was possible for two protesters to enter and exit a major RAF base at night without being arrested.</p> \n<p>Palestine Action said planes from Brize Norton fly regularly to the RAF Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus, used for British operations in the Middle East. More than 500 surveillance flights by Shadow R1 aircraft over the Gaza area have been flown by the RAF from Akrotiri in secretive missions that the UK says are to aid hostage recovery.</p> \n<p>The group accused the UK of being “an active participant in the Gaza genocide and war crimes across the Middle East. By decommissioning two military planes, Palestine Action have directly intervened to break the chains of oppression.”</p> \n<p>The MoD said: “Our armed forces represent the very best of Britain. They put their lives on the line for us, and their display of duty, dedication and selfless personal sacrifice are an inspiration to us all. It is our responsibility to support those who defend us.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Sydney’s recently opened network of city metro stations have taken out one of the top prizes at the Australian Institute of Architects’ 2025 NSW Architecture awards, announced on Friday night.</p> <p>Dozens of Australian architecture firms, engineering companies, landscape designers and public art experts shared in the 2025 NSW architecture medallion for their work on the Central, Barangaroo, Gadigal, Victoria Cross, Martin Place, Waterloo, Sydenham and Crows Nest stations in what the judges hailed as a “legacy-making” and “city-shaping” cross-sector collaboration.</p> <p>“The project is transformative, not just in transport terms but in how it redefines civic experience in Sydney,” the judges’ citation said.</p> <p>“This is infrastructure that supports not just movement, but social and cultural connection as a catalyst for future development and change. It demonstrates the far-reaching impact architects can have on shaping public life and delivering tangible benefit to society and the environment.”</p>    <p>More than 130 NSW projects were shortlisted for the awards, with the first building constructed for the new city of Bradfield and the surrounding area of Aerotropolis – the site of Sydney’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/09/sydneys-second-airport-is-nearly-built-but-will-the-airlines-and-people-come\">future second international airport</a> – collecting the Premier’s prize.</p> <p>Hassell’s First Building – the first stage of an advanced manufacturing readiness facility – is a prefabricated timber pavilion that can be disassembled, expanded or relocated for future use.</p>    <p>“A new city requires a big dream … it’s incredibly exciting to see that dream taking shape here in Bradfield,” the premier, Chris Minns, said of the Hassell design.</p> <p>“The way this building plays with natural light, the way it sits at home in the landscape, it’s incredible attention to detail, it’s craftsmanship – not to mention the innovation and progress that will happen here. In short, it’s a beautiful place.”</p>    <p>GroupGSA’s restoration of a collection of early 20th-century industrial buildings in Rosebery won the Lord Mayor’s prize – restricted to projects within the City of Sydney – for the project’s imaginative commitment to heritage, sustainability and urban vitality.</p> <p>The brick factories and industrial sheds, constructed between 1921 and 1940, and the neighbouring textile mills have been unified into a single precinct, connected by a central pedestrian spine that knits tenant spaces, showrooms and retail outlets together and presents a freshly energised street front for passersby.</p> <p>“This is not capital-A architecture,” the judges said. “[It is] the result of extraordinarily skilful handling – in patching, opening up and scrapping back found fabric – creating an interesting, cohesive experience for workers, visitors and the neighbourhood.”</p>    <p>“Like a trifle made to a cook’s whim” was how judges described BVN’s Yarrila Place, in Coffs Harbour, which won the Sulman medal for public architecture.</p> <p>The new civic and cultural space in the north coast town emerges from the ground with a solid brick base before giving way to deep green ceramic panes, curved and glazed like leaves of the enormous fig tree the building is anchored to.</p>    <p>“BVN have taken all the ingredients of a civic hub – library, gallery, museum, makerspace, civic offices and chambers, and more – and layered them with deliberate unpredictability,” the judges said.</p> <p>“Proportions, adjacencies and stackings defy conventions.”</p>    <p>Heritage work was acknowledged with Design 5’s massive remodelling of the White Bay power station, which collected the Greenway award for heritage, while the conservation award was won by Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and Purcell Architecture for its research-led, methodical and careful approach to restoring Australia’s oldest building in continuous use, the NSW Parliament House in Sydney.</p>    <p>The Colorbond award for steel architecture went to a residential house in Leura. Marra+Yeh Architects’ Eco-House, set in a rare hanging swamp, was praised for its holistic and deeply thoughtful approach to sustainable architecture.</p> <p>The house’s roof design deflects prevailing winds and captures water for reuse in bushfire defence and irrigation, while its interior configuration is season adaptable, ensuring comfort and minimal energy use year round.</p>    <p>BVN collected another award in the residential category for its transformation of a typical suburban block of land in Byron Bay into a dwelling christened the Lighthouse, which seamlessly blends interior with exterior with an open, central garden forming both the entry and heart of the home.</p>    <p>Also in the residential category, Casey Brown Architecture was recognised for its major interior remodelling of Babylon, architect Edwin Kingsberry’s eccentric 1950s residence perched on the ridge dividing Pittwater and Avalon. Its new interior was “full of contradictions – ramshackle and refined, rich and restrained,” judges said.</p> <p>The final result was a highly original interior that was “unexpected, joyful, and completely unique”.</p>    <p>Among the dozens of other winners, of particular note were AJC Architects’ win in the Enduring Architecture category for its Moore Park Gardens residential project in Sydney and Tzannes’ 39 Martin Place, which won the Sir Arthur G Stephenson award for commercial architecture.</p>    <p>Wardle’s handsome industrial park of the future design, Bourke &amp; Bowden, situated in the inner-city Sydney suburb of Alexandria, was also recognised in the commercial category.</p>    <p>The Australian Institute of Architects’ NSW president, Elizabeth Carpenter, said in a statement the 2025 winners highlighted a profession that was “not only responding to urgent challenges, but leading with integrity, innovation and care”.</p> <p>“The awarded projects are powerful reminders that architecture is both an art and a responsibility – one that connects communities, strengthens cultural understanding, and shapes more sustainable and inclusive futures,” she said.</p>",

The state’s utilities have said they did not ask for the plants to stay online, and the Trump administration did not communicate with stakeholders before the order, a spokesperson for the Michigan public service commission (MPSC), which regulates utilities and manages the state’s grid, told the Guardian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/trump-oil-gas-industry-donors\">Trump promised riches from ‘liquid gold’ in the US. Now fossil fuel donors are benefiting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The unnecessary recent order … will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the midwest,” the chair of the MPSC, Dan Scripps, said in a statement. “We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or [the regional US grid].”</p> <p>The massive and ageing facilities also release high levels of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter into the air. Meanwhile, their coal ash ponds leach arsenic, lead, lithium, radium and sulfate into local drinking water and the Great Lakes. The Monroe power plant is responsible for more arsenic water pollution than any other power plant in the US.</p> <p>The DoE in a statement told the Guardian the plan was about grid reliability, and added: “Decommissioning baseload power sources such as coal plants would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems.</p> <p>“This administration is committed to ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows,” a spokesperson added.</p> <p>However, Consumers Energy said in May said it did not need to keep the coal plant online to meet energy needs. It recently bought a nearby gas plant, and has begun building large-scale renewable installations.</p> <p>The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which maintains the regional grid across 15 states, issued a report stating that while there is some risk for power disruption in the summer months, it is low, and “adequate resources are available to maintain reliability”.</p> <p>That could set the stage for a lawsuit from Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, who said in May she may sue over the order to keep the Campbell plant open, and labeled Trump’s energy emergency “fabricated”.</p> <p>The Campbell plant will initially remain open for 90 days, but the order is expected to be renewed, said Jan O’Connell, senior energy organizer with the Sierra Club Michigan.</p> <p>Michigan’s climate law requires 100% clean energy for utilities by 2040. Consumers Energy, which owns the Campbell plant, has since 2021 been planning for the plant’s closure as required by the state’s energy plan. The company said the Campbell plant’s closure would save ratepayers about $600m by 2040.</p> <p>The plant largely shut down for several days before reopening at the end of May, O’Connell said. She noted that many of the employees had already found other jobs, and purchasing coal on the spot is far more expensive than purchasing it months ahead of time, as is standard.</p> <p>The administration’s order is costly and disruptive, and makes no sense for Consumers Energy or its customers, O’Connell said.</p> <p>“This is going to cost the ratepayers a lot of money,” she added.</p> <p>The Trump administration’s plans are also at odds with market forces, opponents say. Gas and renewables are generally cheaper and cause less pollution. Moreover, the nation’s utilities are planning to reduce coal generation by <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64604\">more than 8GW</a> by the end of the year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>O’Connell said it appeared to be an ideological move with no basis in the needs of residents or the energy market.</p> <p>“This is part of their goal to get rid of renewables and bring back fossil fuels,” she added.</p>",

Actually, don’t answer that.</p> <p>On the Other stage, the headliners are homegrown hip-hopper Loyle Carner, pop polymath&nbsp;Charli xcx (dress code: lime green) and dance veterans the Prodigy – their first Glastonbury appearance since the death of frontman Keith Flint, shortly before&nbsp;the 2019 festival. Expect emotional tributes to the twisted&nbsp;firestarter.</p> <h2>Acts to watch</h2>    <p><strong>The festival’s worst clash?<br></strong>Fresh from winning best rap album at this year’s Grammys, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cdbR5ognY\">Florida firecracker Doechii</a> headlines the West Holts stage on Saturday night and will be much talked-about. Her set clashes with Charli xcx, providing a fiendish scheduling dilemma for pop fans. Luckily, TV viewers can flip between both.</p> <p><strong>The hot tips<br></strong>Connoisseurs are abuzz about Baltimore hardcore heroes Turnstile on Sunday. Also eagerly awaited are sets from Mercury prize winners English Teacher, Isle of Wight darlings Wet Leg, Irish crooner CMAT and the force of nature that is Self Esteem (all Friday). Taylor Swift-approved singer Beabadoobee and the Glasto debut of Little Mix alumnus Jade follow on Saturday, before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBGcloF8LIY\">the resurgent Wolf Alice</a> and rap poet Kae Tempest on Sunday.</p> <p>The West Holts headliners, electro duo Maribou State, are set for a breakout Friday night set. US-Ghanaian rapper Amaarae should be suitably fun for Saturday night, as should Ezra Collective, who always bring the jazz party to Pilton. South London soul diva Raye plays the Pyramid before Young.</p> <p><strong>Brace for nostalgia!<br></strong>Nineties music fans are well served on Friday by Alanis Morissette, Busta Rhymes, En Vogue and Supergrass. Noughties indie kids will be kept happy too, courtesy of Franz Ferdinand (Friday), TV on the Radio (Saturday), the Libertines and the Maccabees (Sunday). Is it too hot for skinny jeans?</p> <h2><strong>Surprise secret sets</strong></h2>    <p>There’s always frenzied speculation about A-list acts playing secret sets. This year’s rumour mill has been busier than usual. Slated for a plum Pyramid stage spot at 6.15pm on Saturday is a mystery act called Patchwork. There are also tempting “TBA” slots on the Woodsies and Park stages.</p> <p>Chappell Roan, Lady Gaga and Sabrina Carpenter have been optimistically mentioned. More realistically, Haim, Lorde, Green Day, Kings of Leon and Pulp are widely predicted. The other Britpop band on the comeback trail, of course, are Oasis. Their reunion tour kicks off in Cardiff a week after the festival. Could the Gallaghers be plotting a stealth warmup gig at Worthy Farm? Cider-fuelled sibling fisticuffs – let’s have it.</p> <h2><strong>The controversies</strong></h2>    <p>The press will be primed and ready at 4pm on Saturday when Irish republican rappers Kneecap take to the West Holts stage. There were calls for the Belfast trio to be axed from the lineup after footage emerged of them allegedly telling fans to “kill your local MP”. The band were investigated by police and member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/18/kneecap-rapper-charged-with-terror-offence-released-on-unconditional-bail-liam-og-o-hannaidh\">charged with</a> a terrorism offence. Expect them to respond “robustly” during their set.</p> <p>Later on Saturday night comes Neil Young, who caused a kerfuffle in January when he accidentally announced his headline slot – by cancelling it. Young declared that he was dropping out due to the BBC’s “corporate control”. Two days later, he backtracked, blaming “an error in the information received”. I wonder if corporation executives will cut short his coverage in&nbsp;retaliation?</p> <h2><strong>How to tune in</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfwCDuKGVSE\"                                                                        > <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nfwCDuKGVSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>As is traditional, Glastonbury’s official broadcast partner will infuriate BBC bashers with copious coverage. With live streams of the five biggest stages, there will be more than 90 hours of performances on iPlayer’s dedicated Glastonbury channel.</p> <p>On broadcast TV, there’s extensive programming across BBC One, Two and Four. A tag team of Clara Amfo, Lauren Laverne, Jack Saunders, Huw Stephens, Jamz Supernova and Jo Whiley will guide viewers through the standout sets, while introducing intimate performances at their vantage point overlooking the Park stage.</p> <p>Audio-wise, 6Music’s schedule is devoted to All Day Glastonbury for six days (see what they did there?). Radios 1, 1Xtra, 2 and 4 will also broadcast live from Worthy Farm. There are three visualised episodes of Sidetracked, the hit music podcast hosted by Annie Macmanus and Nick Grimshaw.

Plucked from the crowd, bucket-hatted Alex&nbsp;delivered a word-perfect rendition. The crowd went wild. He&nbsp;went viral.</p> <p><strong>When the lavvy breaks (</strong><strong>1998</strong><strong>)</strong><br>In what was diplomatically dubbed “an unfortunate operational error”, the dance tent was flooded with gallons of excrement. A machine which was meant to suck up excess sewage did the opposite and pumped it in instead.</p> <p><strong>Hey Jude Bellingham (</strong><strong>2024</strong><strong>)</strong><br>The festival didn’t screen Euro&nbsp;24 games due to clashes with live acts. Louis Tomlinson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCpsH8N_oG4\">became a cult</a> hero by doing it himself. For England’s last-16 tie against Slovakia, the One Direction alumnus drove to Argos to buy a TV, generator and dongle. He set them up in the campsite, word spread and a crowd gathered, many not realising who’d pulled off the coup.</p> <p><strong>Bottomless brunch (</strong><strong>1987</strong><strong>)</strong><br>In what’s known as the “trouserless year”, dozens of festival-goers roamed the site in their underpants, looking for their trousers after thieves took them from their tents. Piles of stolen trousers were eventually found in a ditch. It remains a mystery.</p> <p><strong>Muddy hell (</strong><strong>1997</strong><strong>)</strong><br>There have been many soggy Glastos, so imagine how biblical it must have been to go down in history as “the year of the mud”. Relentless rain saw bands cancelled as arenas became waterlogged. Tour buses were immobilised. Marquees became a swamp. By Sunday, the Other stage started to sink into the slurry.</p> <h2>Recreate the festival vibe at home</h2>    <p><strong>Five easy ways to feel </strong><strong>as if you’re in&nbsp;a Som</strong><strong>erset field<br></strong>• Put the central heating on max and close all the windows for that “sleeping in a sweaty tent” authenticity.<br>• Decant all drinks into plastic bottles or wobbly paper cups. Serve&nbsp;lukewarm.<br>• Persuade a neighbour to play ear-splitting drum’n’bass between 3am and 9am, eliminating the slim&nbsp;possibility of sleep.<br>• Don’t turn on the lights after dark. Navigate around your house with a weedy torch instead and keep bumping into things.<br>• Stand in front of the TV behind someone taller, so you have to crane around them to glimpse the&nbsp;screen. If you must sit down, do&nbsp;it in a camping chair with restricted view.</p> <h2>Worthy Farm factoids</h2>    <p>• With a population of 210,000 for the weekend, the festival site becomes England’s 24th biggest city.<br>• Van Morrison is the most frequent Pyramid Stage performer, appearing eight times between 1982 and 2005. Coldplay have headlined the most times with five.<br>• The site has more than 3,300 toilets – approximately one loo per 60 people – as well as 700 metres of male urinals. The festival sprawls over 450 hectares of land – the equivalent of 500 football pitches or 10 Vatican Cities.<br>• The perimeter barrier is 8km long. At 4.12 metres tall with a 45-degree overhang to prevent climbing, it’s known as the “Super Fortress Fence”.<br>• Elton John became the most-watched headliner in history last year, with 7.6 million viewers tuning in to the BBC broadcast - far exceeding the 4.1 million record set by Ed Sheeran in 2017.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The amount of water being sucked from England’s rivers has surged to record levels, with potentially disastrous consequences for people and wildlife, it can be revealed.</p> <p>An investigation into licensing data by <a href=\"https://watershedinvestigations.com/\">Watershed Investigations</a> and the Guardian found that the volume of water taken from rivers and lakes for industrial or public consumption has jumped 76% in two decades: 11.6m cubic metres (410 cu ft) were abstracted in the five years to 2023, up from 6.6m in the early 2000s.</p> <p>Abstraction – the removal of water from rivers, lakes, underground aquifers or tidal waters – is permitted for farming, industry or public supply. Anyone using more than 20 cubic metres a day needs a licence from the Environment Agency or Natural Resources Wales, setting limits on how much water they can take. Similar rules apply in Scotland.</p> <p>River abstraction now accounts for 61% of all water taken from the environment, up from under 40% at the turn of the century. Groundwater use has also risen sharply, up 53% since 2018. Meanwhile, use of tidal water has plummeted, falling from almost half of total abstraction to just over a quarter.</p> <p>“Our rivers are under threat,” said Nick Measham, the chief executive of the conservation charity <a href=\"https://wildfish.org/\">WildFish</a>. “We are putting extra demands on water resources when the rivers are running dry. When it does rain after persistent dry periods, we often return our water polluted, which means that river habitats for animals and plants are in serious trouble.”</p> <p>Some of the increases are the result of existing activities being licensed for the first time. Some water use is classed as non-consumptive because it is returned shortly after, such as in navigation, hydropower or power station cooling, but campaigners say this is not harmless as water is lost in the process, and what is returned is often polluted.</p> <p>The maximum volume of water licensed to be taken from rivers and lakes has increased by 6% over the past decade, from 25.5bn to 27bn cubic metres. Meanwhile, caps on groundwater and tidal abstraction have fallen 4% and 42% respectively since 2013.</p>    <p>The Environment Agency, which issues the licences, has long warned that without intervention an extra 5bn litres a day will be needed for public water supply by 2055, plus another 1bn litres for industry and farming.</p> <p>Initially, 80% of this shortfall will need to be made up by making people use less and by fixing leaks – water companies still lose about 19% of the water they supply, or roughly 3bn litres a day, through leaky pipes.</p> <p>Experts say this could have been avoided if investment in new infrastructure had come sooner. “We should have been building reservoirs 10 years ago,” said one industry source, blaming successive governments for “a lack of appetite” for it.</p> <p>Due to the lack of storage, during droughts water companies plan to draw even more water from rivers – precisely when they are most vulnerable.</p> <p>Measham said: “There has been a woeful lack of forward thinking to cope with demand. Depleted and polluted, rivers that were once abundant in fish, invertebrates, mammals and birds turn into a line of fetid pools that eventually dry out completely.”</p> <p>On the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/02/irreplaceable-habitat-planning-bill-raises-fears-for-englands-chalk-streams\">River Itchen</a>, the impact is already showing. In 2022 and 2024, returning adult salmon numbers hit the lowest and third lowest levels ever recorded – just 133 and 187 fish respectively. If another drought hits, the river and its endangered salmon could be pushed to the edge.</p> <p>“The cost is to the rivers, they are paying the price, and fish are paying the price,” said WildFish’s Janina Gray.</p>    <p>The water sector is clear about the urgency of the problem. A Water UK spokesperson said: “The threat to our water security is not a distant risk, it’s a looming challenge. After not building a single reservoir in over 30 years, we’ve finally been given initial approval for 10, plus seven water recycling schemes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/29/first-new-reservoirs-in-england-for-more-that-30-years-given-go-ahead\">These projects</a> will help reduce pressure on abstraction.”</p> <p>Some parts of the country are seeing extreme increases in water use. In the Midlands, abstraction has soared 132% in a decade, from 1.6bn to 3.6bn cubic metres, now rivalling that in the north-west. Meanwhile, the southern region has seen a 26% drop. In Wales, Powys alone holds 42% of all authorised abstraction volumes, with water supply and energy as the main drivers. Conwy, Ceredigion and Gwynedd follow.</p> <p>The Environment Agency says about 15% of rivers and lakes and 27% of groundwater bodies have abstraction rates that damage the environment and that by the 2050s summer river flows in England could fall by up to 33%.</p> <p>An Environment Agency spokesperson said the nation’s water resources were “under huge and steadily increasing pressure”. They said: By harnessing the latest technology and intelligence, upgrades to the licensing system will allow us to focus inspections on the highest-risk abstractions and provide real-time information to water users.</p> <p>“New powers under the Water Special Measures Act mean we can enforce licensing more effectively and ensure water companies are held accountable when they fall short of expected standards.”</p> <p>This week the government published its national framework for water resources, in which it set out plans for reform. A Defra spokesperson said: “Rapid population growth, crumbling infrastructure and climate change mean we need a major water overhaul. The government has secured £104bn in private investment for nine new reservoirs and new pipes, and is modernising the abstraction system to protect the environment.”</p>",

El Bulli closed in 2011.</p> <p>“Copying El Bulli is over. Now it’s become a huge repertoire of techniques that each person can apply to their cooking,” said Jordi Artal, chef at the two-starred Cinc Sentits in Barcelona. “I wouldn’t say there’s a backlash; it’s part of the natural ebb and flow. We use modern techniques but in ways that hark back to Catalan gastronomic history. That’s the ideal.”</p> <p>Artal said there had always been a schism between those who believe you should only cook what’s in season and Adrià saying: “I’m an artist, find me the world’s best cherry in January so I can make my dish.”</p>    <p>Carme Ruscalleda said: “The concept may have changed but my cooking has always been based in the Mediterranean and its produce.” The chef was speaking in her home town of Sant Pol de Mar, next door to the restaurant where she won the first of seven Michelin stars. “We must embrace new ideas without losing sight of who we are. Catalan cuisine has Roman and Greek and medieval roots. We make many dishes that are basically medieval but with modern techniques.”</p> <p>This year chefs such as the Roca brothers in Girona and Jordi Vilà in Barcelona have opened – running alongside their flagship restaurants – more modest establishments where they offer more traditional dishes.</p> <p>“We are taking a broad but not a simplified view of Catalan cuisine,” said Joan Roca about Fontané, the brothers’ latest venture, where prices are well below those of El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world.</p> <p>Vilà, chef at one-starred Alkimia and the more homespun Al Kostat del Mar, said: “Joan Roca and Carme Ruscalleda have always cooked Catalan food but what happened was that what became important was what we call <em>cocina vanguardista </em>[avant-garde cuisine]<em>,</em> when what really matters is to use local produce and express yourself in your cooking.</p> <p>“Many young chefs don’t aspire to be Joan Roca or Ferran Adrià but want to cook the dishes their mothers or grandmothers made.”</p> <p>Tradition doesn’t always come cheap, however. The tasting menus at high-end restaurants such as El Celler de Can Roca cost upwards of €200 (£170), without wine. </p> <p>Oriol Castro, one of three chefs – all ex-El Bulli – behind Disfrutar, voted best restaurant in the world last year, said no one expected people to pay those sorts of prices for basic Catalan dishes.</p>    <p>“In Disfrutar we offer many dishes based on traditional recipes, with new techniques but traditional flavours, such as a <em>suquet de peix</em> [fish and potato stew] or <em>mar i m</em><em>untanya</em> [seafood and rabbit or chicken casserole],” said Castro, who insists there is no backlash against the El Bulli school of cooking.</p> <p>“People come here to eat modern, creative versions of traditional dishes. What’s important is the combination of creativity and tradition. There isn’t a war. All of us want to preserve this tradition.”</p> <p>Artal said that while he was no purist, in keeping with his principles there were only Catalan and Spanish wines on his wine list. “I can’t explain to a customer that a dish was inspired by my great-grandmother and that we’re using locally sourced ingredients and then serve a wine from Bordeaux,” he said. “I love yuzu but there’s no yuzu on the menu because I couldn’t say my grandmother used yuzu.”</p> <p>Everyday Catalan cuisine may be in good health outside Barcelona but in the capital it’s far easier to find ramen, sushi, hamburgers or pizza than traditional fare. </p> <p>“I’m not against ramen or hamburgers, I’m against globalization,” said Vilà, who has published a humorous “self-defence manual” for Catalan cooking. “Here there are 50 ramen places and none that serve <em>escudella</em>,” a traditional Catalan stew containing pasta or noodles.</p> <p>Ruscalleda said: “Young people are attracted to the new, so they order sushi or ceviche but they don’t know about their own culture.” She shares the view that the biggest threat to traditional cuisine everywhere is that people have stopped cooking at home.</p> <p>In the meantime, it seems it is up to the culinary elite to maintain tradition, a paradox that Vilà accepts.</p> <p>“We’re in a transition because the grandmothers of the future don’t want to stay at home cooking, they want to be out in the world,” he said. “Obviously, a top chef is no substitute for a grandmother, but it’s up to us keep the tradition alive.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Sam Gilliam’s artistic life was bookended by success against the odds. In 1972, he became the first Black artist to represent the US at the world’s most prestigious art festival, the Venice Biennale. He had overcome poverty and prejudice in the south to study art at one of the first desegregated universities, and, after settling in Washington, was hailed as a radical innovator within the group of abstract painters dubbed the Color School.</p> <p>Pushing his medium in new sculptural directions, he broke convention by taking his canvases off their wooden stretchers. His best-known colour-drenched works have an improvisatory quality, never installed the same way twice, whether they’re draped on the wall or hung tent-like from the ceiling.</p> <p>When the art world turned away from abstraction in the following decades, however, he was all but forgotten. He was approaching 80 in 2012 when the young art star Rashid Johnson championed his work, curating an exhibition that led to a fresh slate of big international shows and museum recognition. Yet as Gilliam said in an interview two years before his death in 2022, in art, “Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I’ve never lost entirely. We just keep on keeping on.”</p> <p>Sewing Fields, a new exhibition featuring unseen work from Gilliam’s residency at the Ballinglen Art Foundation on the west coast of Ireland in 1993,<strong> </strong>reveals how he never stopped making and innovating.</p> <p>“He was so prolific,” says the show’s co-curator, Mary Cremin. “There’s still a huge amount of his work that’s never been shown.” One of the biggest surprises is that he worked in Ireland at all. The isolated rural location with its sea cliffs and rolling hills must have been a major change for an artist who spent his life in cosmopolitan Washington’s creative community.</p> <p>He wasn’t afraid of mixing things up, though. Prohibited from flying across the Atlantic with petrol-based paints, he was compelled to paint, print and dye materials in his Washington studio in advance, and pursue new processes in Ireland. It resulted in a fresh approach with cut-up collaged fragments of paintings including screen-printed cloth and paper and material thick with paint. “Needs must is the mother of invention,” says the curator.</p> <p>It was the experience of being captivated by laundry billowing on a line that first led Gilliam to set the canvas free from wooden stretchers to create his characteristic draped works. His approach to painting was expansive, underlining art’s connection to lowly cloth while nodding to histories of Black female labour. In Ireland, he worked with a seamstress to stitch his layered compositions of collaged painted fabrics with distinct zigzagging lines of thread. “He supposedly had six sewing machines in his Ballinglen studio,” says Cremin. She points out that Ireland’s light and unpredictable weather fed into Gilliam’s explosive use of colour, too. “The sky changes, the seasons change in a single day,” says Cremin. “In these works, the tone changes all the time.”</p> <p>One reason given for Gilliam’s art-world wilderness years is that, during the rise of identity politics in the 1980s, his work didn’t foreground Black experience. Today, it’s his commitment to constant experimentation within his medium that the curator sees as crucial to his legacy for younger artists. Says Cremin: “If there’s a rule, he tries to break it.”</p> <h2><strong>Look of the Irish: five works from Sewing Fields</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Folded Cottage</strong><strong> II, 1993</strong><strong><br></strong>This kickstarted the experimental body of work Gilliam produced on Ireland’s west coast and, as the title suggests, it took formal inspiration from its coastal dwellings. There’re all kinds of painterly techniques on the fragments he collaged, including stained and splashed paint, as well as his signature method of raking lines in pigment.</p>    <p><strong>Doonfeeny Lower, 1994</strong><strong><br></strong>Gilliam pushed painting into sculptural territory with works that spoke to the human body and the world beyond the gallery. With its loops of fabric across its top edge, this collaged painting looks almost wearable – or like curtains. The stitched lines of thread that hold the composition together crisscross like pencil marks.</p>    <p><strong>Count on Us, 2008<br></strong>This dyed nylon trio is typical of Gilliam’s key move as an artist: draped paintings that freed the fabric support from its traditional wooden stretcher. The buoyant palette channels the jubilation felt when Obama was elected in 2008. As the co-curator Mary Cremin points out, it’s hard not to wonder what the Washington-based artist would have made of the current president.</p>    <p><strong>Silhouette</strong><strong>/Template, 1994</strong><strong><br></strong>This is one of many later works that would be inspired by Gilliam’s time in Ireland. Rippling across the wall like a kite or rolling hills, it’s testament to the improvisatory nature of his work, in terms of the painting itself, and how it might change each time it’s hung. “It’s unpredictable,” says Cremin.</p>    <p><strong>Pages and Echoes #8, 1998</strong><strong><br></strong>From primary hued paint spatters to deep moody mauves, this work pops with contrasting textures and tones. The handmade printed paper among the painted fabric, shows the influence of his sometime collaborator, the revered printmaker William Weege.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://imma.ie/whats-on/sam-gilliam/\">Sewing Fields is at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, to 25 January.</a></em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>Described as “a troublemaker of the very best kind”, the health activist Jean Robinson, who has died aged 95, championed the rights of patients, pregnant women and disadvantaged people for more than 50 years. She was chair of the <a href=\"https://www.patients-association.org.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=304572063&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADflGFnXFzsGggkyyGmJ6xp-GJvdW&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwx8nCBhAwEiwA_z__0-uir8SIuAjt99njAW3roRXhV5dPXBCi8tpcnqb8Ch54Kg9cqfeENRoCKPAQAvD_BwE\">Patients’ Association</a>, president of Aims (the <a href=\"https://www.aims.org.uk/about-aims\">Association for Improvements in Maternity Services</a>) and a lay member and outspoken critic of the doctors’ regulatory body the <a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/\">General Medical Council</a>. In 1988 she wrote the explosive booklet <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1988-12-19/debates/9088afcf-1321-4e0d-8c9c-6a3418322bd6/APatientVoiceAtTheGmc\">A Patient Voice at the GMC</a>, laying bare its inadequacies and contributing to its reform.</p> <p>Robinson’s activist career took off in 1966, when, living in Oxford and looking after her young son, she was invited to become a lay member of the regional health board. She was not prepared to be a rubber stamp appointment and said the board statistician nearly fell off his chair when “the token housewife” came to his office with detailed questions about perinatal mortality rates.</p> <p>Robinson always worked in a voluntary capacity and had no clinical or social care background. But that gave her independence to scrutinise healthcare decisions and champion patients. She said: “I am always concerned about people who think they can make decisions about other people’s lives. In politics we have had a degree of democracy, whereas in education, medicine and healthcare we have not had any power from the bottom.”</p> <p>She was passionately keen to educate herself about the workings of the regional health board. Armed with a medical dictionary and library card, she read voraciously, scrutinising even the driest hospital management circular. Condescending officialdom infuriated her and the more she found out about how healthcare was run in her patch, the more she felt obliged to speak out, calling out, for example, the way children living with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/downs-syndrome\">Down’s syndrome</a> were closeted away in an old-fashioned asylum.</p>    <p>She was not afraid to antagonise colleagues. In fact, in 1973 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crossman\">Richard Crossman</a>, the Labour secretary of state for health, asked to meet her, saying: “I’ve never in all my public life seen so much pressure to get rid of anyone. They absolutely hate you.” They had a good exchange and Crossman did not sack Robinson, but as she had been on the health board for seven years she decided to leave and take up a new challenge.</p> <p>She then joined the Patients’ Association, which had been set up in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/thalidomide-scandal-timeline\">thalidomide scandal</a>. The founder wanted to retire, so Robinson became its chair. She spent the next three years answering hundreds of complaints each week from the public. Many were from new mothers. Robinson said: “Letters about birth leapt off the page.” In the 1970s, 60% of women were given an oxytocin drip to induce labour, which caused severe and sudden contractions. It could be very traumatic, inducing a form of shell shock. Robinson set out to study the research underpinning this practice. She found one main study, carried out in Glasgow, was on far too small a sample. The researchers wanted to see if inducing births could reduce the rate of stillbirth and gave oxytocin to 100 women, comparing them with others receiving standard care. </p> <p>However, the rate of stillbirth at this time in Glasgow was three in 1,000, so such a small study could not prove anything. Robinson wrote to the Lancet medical journal pointing out this, along with many other flaws. To sceptical detractors who thought her letter was drafted by an obstetrician, Robinson retorted: “No doctor has written it for me. All I needed was a Bodleian reader’s card and letters from 400 women who have had induced labour.”</p> <p>When young widows had a higher risk of cervical cancer, it was presumed it was because they swiftly took new sexual partners. But Robinson posed the question “Who gets widowed early?” It was often wives of men in occupations such as construction, mining or asbestos, and as she pointed out, women’s exposure to carcinogenic chemicals could have played a part.</p> <p>In 1975, when her term as chair of the association ended, Robinson joined Aims as its honorary research officer. It was a role she said fitted her like a glove, combining taking calls on the helpline with writing summaries of the latest obstetric research in plain English for its quarterly journal. Listening to distraught new mothers on the phone every day opened her eyes to mental health issues. </p> <p>She persuaded the Department of Health to recognise suicide as a key cause of maternal death and the letter she wrote with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/05/beverley-lawrence-beech-obituary\">Beverley Beech</a> in 1987 to the British Journal of Psychiatry about nightmares after childbirth is credited in medical literature as the first identification of postnatal PTSD. Robinson also challenged routine episiotomies and championed women threatened with removal of their babies, exposing the fact that social services had targets to increase adoptions.</p> <p>In 1979 Robinson was appointed a lay member of the General Medical Council, where she heard cases on the professional conduct committee. She was shocked that the public were so poorly served. For example, GMC rules allowed only eight weeks to complain about a GP, starting from the event, not from the time the person was aware of a problem. If a woman with a breast lump was not examined properly by her GP, for example, it might take her months to realise the lump was growing, by which time the deadline would have expired. </p> <p>In 1988 Robinson wrote A Patient Voice at the GMC, described as “a remarkable insider’s account”. It detailed all the problems, explaining why three-quarters of complaints submitted were not even heard. Meeting her, the Conservative secretary of state for health Kenneth Clarke said the booklet was rather critical and winked: “I’m not opposed to that.” The booklet fuelled a growing clamour for change. Pressure from politicians, the British Medical Journal and others, as well as events such as the Bristol heart scandal in the 1990s, eventually brought about major changes at the GMC.</p>    <p>She was born in Southwark, London, the second of three children of Charles Lynch, a clerk at Tate and Lyle, and Ellen (nee Penfold). When the second world war broke out in 1939, Jean and her two brothers were evacuated to Somerset, and 18 months later to Cornwall. When she returned to London in 1945, her parents urged her to do a secretarial course so she might get a white-collar job. While she was on the course, she joined the Labour League of Youth, much to the disappointment of her working-class Tory parents. But, she said: “From the earliest age I was interested in people being less privileged and that something should be done about it.”</p> <p>She got a job at the Daily Herald, a national Labour newspaper, and then became secretary to the MP Geoffrey de Freitas, who encouraged her, aged 23, to apply to Ruskin College in Oxford to do a two-year diploma in politics, history and economics. She savoured the chance to learn. Entering the Bodleian library for the first time, she said: “I felt overwhelmed with riches. If you’d put me in a room full of jewels, it could not have matched what I felt.” Halfway through the course, she spent a year as an exchange student at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York, where she studied American politics.</p> <p>While at Ruskin College, she met the labour market economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/15/derek-robinson\">Derek Robinson</a>, whom she married in 1956. The couple adopted Toby in 1965, had a daughter Lucy four years later, and made their home in Oxford. She got a secretarial job at the market research company Nielsen, which led to work with the Oxford Consumers Group. However, she discovered job opportunities in Oxford were scarce and volunteering could be the route to much more interesting work, so in 1966 she agreed to be a lay member of the regional health board.</p> <p>As well as her work at the GMC, Robinson remained involved with Aims, and was elected its president in 2010, retiring only in 2018. From 1995 to 2006 she wrote a column for the British Journal of Midwifery, giving midwives an insight into issues from a user’s perspective, and in 1997 she was made a visiting professor at Ulster University, giving lectures on medical ethics. She was also a trustee of a women’s refuge in Oxford.</p> <p>Derek died in 2014. Robinson is survived by Toby and Lucy, four grandchildren, Al, Sean, Stevie and Vegas, and two great-grandchildren, Cassius and Vida.</p> <p> • Jean Robinson, medical activist, born 17 April 1930; died 4 June 2025</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Like the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, Israel’s war on Iran is neither legal nor just. It is a war of choice, not of necessity – and should the US or its European allies, particularly Britain, join in, they risk being dragged into another disastrous and unlawful conflict in the Middle East.</p> <p>A US military intervention would be in direct contravention of international law. Already, the US, once the architect and guardian of the international order, is now among its chief violators. Instead of pressuring Benjamin Netanyahu to end his siege and destruction of Gaza, Donald Trump has fully sided with Netanyahu and called Israel’s attacks on Iran “excellent”. He has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender”. Trump is considering military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Doing so is explicitly prohibited under article 56 of the additional protocol to the Geneva conventions because of the danger of nuclear contamination.</p> <p>Britain, meanwhile, must tread carefully. The attorney general has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/19/attorney-general-uk-war-iran-illegal\">reportedly</a> warned that any UK military involvement beyond defensive support would be illegal. Richard Hermer, the government’s top legal adviser, is said to have raised internal concerns about the legality of joining a bombing campaign.</p> <p>The foundation of Israel’s justification for launching pre-emptive strikes and of Washington’s quiet complicity is alarming. The core claim is that Iran was rapidly taking steps to “<a href=\"https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1933329728246534596\">weaponise its uranium</a>”, with Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, repeatedly warning that Tehran was approaching a point of no return in developing a nuclear bomb.</p> <p>But Netanyahu’s narrative flatly contradicts the US intelligence assessment, which found that not only is Iran <em>not</em> actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it remains <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/17/politics/israel-iran-nuclear-bomb-us-intelligence-years-away\">at least</a> three years away from having the capability to do so. The CIA disputes the Israeli claim that Iran is close to crossing a nuclear threshold.</p> <p>Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, <a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/tulsi-iran-bomb/\">testified</a> in March that Iran was <em>not </em>building a nuclear weapon and that the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, had not authorised a nuclear programme, one that was in fact suspended in 2003. Even if Iran was making a bomb, international law doesn’t give Israel and the US the right to bomb Iran. The UN charter is clear on the use of force in international relations.</p> <p>Yet, when pressed about this contradiction, Trump dismissed the intelligence outright. “I don’t care what she said,” he told reporters. “I think they were very close to having it.” Netanyahu and Trump’s narrative also stands in direct opposition to findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose director general, Rafael Grossi, <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/articles-id/31427\">confirmed</a> on 17 June that there was “no proof” Iran was systematically developing nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Set against this backdrop, US military intervention would rupture the rules-based international order further and make future conflicts more unpredictable and dangerous. Other powerful states could launch offensive wars under the pretext of pre-empting real or imagined threats to their national security. Today, it’s Israel and the US. Tomorrow, China could use the same rationale to justify attacking Taiwan.</p> <p>The echoes of the Iraq war should also raise alarm bells. Then, as now, war was sold on manufactured intelligence. Netanyahu was a vocal <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2002/US/09/12/netanyahu.cnna/\">supporter</a> of the neoconservative movement that led the Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq and justified it with claims about Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorism. George W Bush sold that war with the now-infamous line about Hussein’s “<a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html\">massive stockpile</a>” of biological weapons, despite the CIA stating it had “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/7/9/12123022/george-w-bush-lies-iraq-war\">no specific information</a>” on quantities or types. Bush went further, claiming: “We do not know whether or not [Iraq] has a nuclear weapon,” contradicting his own intelligence. He knew, and he lied.</p> <p>Trump, for his part, publicly criticised that very deception, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiw0ILaXJf0\">saying</a> Bush’s decision to invade Iraq was “the worst decision any president has made in the history of this country [the US]”, adding: “There were no weapons of mass destruction, and they knew there were none.” Yet Trump today appears to borrow a page from Bush’s playbook.</p> <p>Although there is no plan for a US ground invasion of Iran, any attack on Tehran risks spiralling into a full-blown regional war. Iran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against US bases in Iraq, Bahrain and the wider Gulf. A mission creep could easily escalate, triggering a cycle of strikes and counterstrikes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israel-attacks-irans-arak-heavy-water-reactor-as-iran-hits-israeli-hospital\">Trump sets deadline of two weeks to decide if US will join Israel’s war on Iran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, Iran could mine the strait of Hormuz, a critical choke point for global energy flows. The effects could reverberate globally, hitting energy markets and causing an inflationary cycle, weakening confidence in the US dollar, and potentially plunging the US economy into stagflation.</p> <p>Even the Houthis, with far fewer military capabilities than Iran, have managed to severely inflict damage and disrupt shipping in the Red Sea. If the US joins Israel’s war, Iran could cripple global trade routes and send oil prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/16/iran-israel-conflict-middle-east-oil\">soaring</a>.</p> <p>If the US joins Israel’s war on Iran, it could backfire spectacularly, and potentially strengthen the regime rather than weakening it. One likely outcome is that the clerics will dash forward towards making a nuclear bomb, pointing to Israel’s attack and attempt at regime change as justification. Meanwhile, in the UK, Keir Starmer would do well to remember the bitter legacy of Tony Blair, who led Britain into Iraq alongside the US. </p> <ul> <li><p>Fawaz Gerges is professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.

            "body" : "<p>Abed Al Rahman, just a boy, carried the weight of his family’s hunger as he stepped into the streets of Gaza in search of bread. He had his father’s money, but when he saw the tide of people pushing towards a food distribution site in Rafah, hunger pulled him into their flow.</p> <p>Almost immediately, the site descended into chaos. Gunfire. Drones. Then in a flash, shrapnel from a tank shell ripped through his little body. When I met him at a hospital in Khan Younis – where painkillers, like food, are scarce – the 13-year-old was in agony. “I have shrapnel inside my body that they couldn’t remove,” he told me. “I am in real pain; since 6am I have been asking for a painkiller.” As he recounted the chaos, his father’s composure shattered, and tears rolled down his face. Was he going to lose his son simply because Abed Al Rahman wanted his family to eat?</p> <p>Abed Al Rahman had been trying to get food from a new private and militarised distribution site in Gaza. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is funnelling aid through a handful of southern sites guarded by private contractors and Israeli soldiers. With so few distribution points, those who can make the trek are forced to travel long, dangerous distances – risking their lives for grossly inadequate amounts of supplies.</p> <p>In the first week of the GHF’s operation, there were <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/new-shooting-gaza-aid-site-kills-24-people/story?id=122438419\">five mass-casualty events</a> in the vicinity of distribution sites as desperate civilians were met by gun and tank fire. Children have been killed. The UN’s aid chief, <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1163206\">Tom Fletcher, said</a> the sites made “starvation a bargaining chip” and were “a fig leaf for further violence and displacement”. A system that bypasses the UN has, in fact, bypassed humanity. Indeed, politicised aid distribution is unsafe for everyone involved – last week, the GHF said eight of its local team members and volunteers had been killed.</p> <p>And while it’s critical that there is a focus on this lethal lack of aid for Palestinians, the daily killing and maiming of children has become an afterthought. This is my fifth mission to Gaza since the horrors of 7 October, and in all that time almost nothing has been done to stop the world’s deadliest conflict for children in recent memory. There have been more than <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip\">50,000 children</a> reported killed or injured in 20 months. Fifty thousand.</p> <p>On the same morning I met Abed Al Rahman, I spoke with 24-year-old Sheima, also hospitalised. She, too, went to one of the GHF distribution sites. Different day, same story: her family was denied humanitarian aid for months. Consumed by hunger, her father too sick to travel, Sheima reached a site. Again, gunfire. Boxes of food thrown to the dirt. “I saw dead bodies on the ground,” she told me. “People stepping over them, just trying to get some food.” In the mayhem, Sheima became entangled in wire – her leg and arm torn open as she tried to flee. She didn’t get any food. “Even though I almost died, I would go again,” she said. “I’m the eldest in my family – we need food to survive. I wish to die with a full stomach, not from starvation.”</p> <p>These raw testimonials reinforce two critical questions. First, when UN and international non-governmental organisations warehouses outside Gaza are jam-packed with lifesaving supplies, why is there still a lethal lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza? And second, will these few sites run by private contractors solve the crisis?</p> <p>On the first point, after a total blockade on all supplies going into Gaza from early March until 19 May, Unicef and the World Food Programme are now permitted to bring in limited quantities of only a few selected items. Meanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/risk-famine-across-all-gaza-new-report-says\">warned last month</a> that all 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza are facing life-threatening food insecurity. Lack of access to clean water has been pushed to lethal levels.</p> <p>Amid incessant bombardments, drastic aid restrictions and mass displacement of the civilian population, the risk of famine is not just possible, but increasingly likely for families in Gaza. From the end of the ceasefire to May this year, malnutrition admissions among children aged under five <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/6/un-warns-of-surge-in-acute-malnutrition-among-gazas-young-children\">surged by nearly 150%</a>, with a steep rise in severe cases. This isn’t just a trend – it’s an urgent warning.</p> <p>And to the second question, can the GHF prevent famine? The reality is, far too little aid is being distributed from far too few distribution points, all amid concerns that families travelling from northern Gaza to reach sites in the south will not be allowed to return.</p> <p>This is not how you avert famine. Before the collapse of the most recent ceasefire, the UN operated a highly effective aid delivery system in Gaza. And during the ceasefire, we were delivering assistance from more than 400 distribution points across the territory. Access to food, safe water, medicines and shelter skyrocketed. Unicef even went door-to-door to reach malnourished children.</p> <p>Unicef continues to call for a ceasefire, protection of children, the release of hostages and full aid access. We know what it takes to deliver for children in emergencies – it is the same in every crisis and every conflict since the second world war. Children need nutritious food at scale, safety, clean water and dignity. Not security operators. Not indiscriminate fire. Not chaos.</p> <p>There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We delivered aid at scale during the ceasefire, and we can do it again. We just need to be allowed to do our jobs.</p> <p><em>Abed Al Rahman died of his injuries on 17 June 2025, after this article was written.</em></p> <ul> <li><p>James Elder is Unicef’s global spokesperson</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The habitat is home to 57 species of animals including giraffes, zebras and ostriches.</p> <p>Andrew Owen, the head of birds at Chester zoo, said: “These ducklings are very special as they’re the first of their kind to ever hatch here at the zoo, making it a really historic moment for our team.</p> <p>“This success gives a real boost to the future of the species and these vital new additions will contribute to the safety-net population in zoos. These birds are facing rapid decline in the wild, so every hatchling really does count.”</p> <p>The zoo is one of only seven in Europe, and 12 globally, that care for the ducks and it hopes to play a vital role in their survival.</p> <p>Maccoa ducks are found in nutrient-rich freshwater wetland and lakes. They can be seen diving for food and are known for their stiff tails and deep-blue bills.</p> <p>They are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list of threatened species.

            "body" : "<p>The drugs policy campaigner Peter Krykant, who has died suddenly aged 48, advanced the cause of the harm reduction movement through a transformative act of civil disobedience.</p> <p>Fitting out a van as a mobile safer drug consumption space and making it available to Glasgow’s most vulnerable homeless addicts broke the law. And it also – eventually – broke the stalemate around UK drugs policy, propelled Scotland’s drug deaths crisis further up the political agenda and, most importantly, saved lives.</p> <p>Krykant’s law-breaking plan coalesced in February 2020 after he attended what he saw as another talking shop – a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/scotland-to-hold-drugs-summit-a-day-before-uks-at-same-venue\">Scottish government conference</a> focused on drug deaths, which took place 24 hours before a UK government summit on the same subject, at the same Glasgow venue. It seemed to him a ludicrous show of escalating tensions between the two administrations.</p> <p>“The conferences were the final straw, and the fact that [a drug consumption room pilot] is being used as a political football,” he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/glasgow-activist-risks-arrest-to-set-up-drug-consumption-room-in-a-van\">told the Guardian</a> a week later. “As a person who went through my own trauma – drug use and street homelessness issues many years ago – I cannot stand back.”</p> <p>Within days of announcing his plan to purchase a vehicle and customise it as a mobile safer-injecting suite, Krykant had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/glasgow-activist-risks-arrest-to-set-up-drug-consumption-room-in-a-van\">raised more than £2,000</a>. He was immediately sacked from his job as an HIV outreach worker at the charity Waverley Care.</p> <p>Undeterred by the looming global Covid pandemic, Krykant recognised that, as services contracted, the homeless drug users who congregated around Trongate in Glasgow were even more in need. So he struck out in the midst of lockdown, first in a minibus nicknamed “the Tank” and later in a converted ambulance, providing clean water, needles and swabs, as well as supplies of naloxone, the potentially life-saving drug that reverses the effects of opioid overdose. Rules included using your own drugs, and agreeing to an overdose intervention if needed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/30/uk-first-drug-consumption-van\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Krykant later explained: “Overdose prevention services are an internationally recognised way of reducing drug-related harms. It benefits everyone by supporting the most vulnerable and saving taxpayers’ money on ambulance callouts, hospital admissions and council clean-up teams.”</p> <p>The local police largely tolerated his activity, although he was charged in October 2020 for obstructing officers attempting to search his van – the charges were later dropped. He continued operating until May 2021. More than 1,000 injections were supervised, and nine overdoses reversed.</p> <p>“It was the trust people had in Peter, the cup of tea and the Mars bar, that really helped them and is hard to quantify,” said the MSP Paul Sweeney, who became a close friend when the pair volunteered together at the van. “He proved all the naysayers and the procrastinators wrong. He never said it was a silver bullet but Peter knew firsthand the particular risks for people who inject on the street and saw that this intervention could directly save lives.”</p> <p>Krykant was always insistent that addiction should be understood in the wider context of poverty and inequality, a message he took around the doorsteps of his local Holyrood constituency of Falkirk East when he stood for the Scottish parliament elections in May 2021.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2021/apr/29/heroin-to-holyrood-man-behind-drug-van-runs-for-scottish-parliament-video\">A Guardian film</a>, which followed his campaign, captures his younger son, aglow with pride, explaining to the producers: “I’ve got three reasons you should vote for my dad: because he’s honest, reliable and he listens to people’s suggestions.”</p> <p>But the responsibility he evidently carried for every individual he helped, the memories they stirred of his own trauma as well as escalating public scrutiny, took their toll and Krykant relapsed.</p> <p>He had talked openly about darker currents in his childhood in the village of Maddiston, near Falkirk; trauma and sexual abuse that would lead him to start taking drugs when he was 11. He left school with no formal qualifications, and by his late teens he was sleeping rough and injecting heroin.</p> <p>But eventually he found support to live drug-free, and worked successfully in sales for over a decade, first in Brighton, and later returning north of the border, where he subsequently trained as an addiction support worker. During this time he married and started a family, taking market research work to fit around caring for his two young sons.</p> <p>Krykant had continued his advocacy work in recent years, passing the van on to the <a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/\">Transform Drug Policy Foundation</a> and embarking on a tour across the UK. Lately he worked at the harm reduction charity <a href=\"https://cranstoun.org/\">Cranstoun</a>, where he developed an overdose response app called <a href=\"https://cranstoun.org/news/new-app-to-prevent-overdose-deaths/\">BuddyUp</a> and represented the organisation at events around the world.</p> <p>When the UK’s first legal drug consumption room, the Thistle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/10/all-eyes-are-on-glasgow-uk-first-legal-drug-consumption-room-ready-open\">opened its doors</a> in Glasgow this January, there were many who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/15/glasgow-thistle-first-legal-drug-consumption-room\">drew a direct line </a>from his minibus to its airy vestibule. Others felt his contribution had been sidelined to make way for more mainstream voices, or that his vulnerabilities had been exploited by those who desired the frisson of his lived experience for their campaigns. </p> <p>This winter, say friends, Krykant found himself at his lowest ebb. His marriage had collapsed, he had lost his job and he was struggling to support himself, worrying about the impact this had on his sons.</p> <p>Martin Powell, who drove the van on its UK tour, said: “He was the catalyst and without him we might still be waiting. Without question there are people alive today who would not be without Peter Krykant. It’s an absolute tragedy that he isn’t one of them.”</p> <p>Krykant is survived by his sons.</p> <p> • Peter Krykant, campaigner, born 13 November 1976; died 9 June 2025</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The weekend before Genevieve Meehan died was one of the best of her short life.</p> <p>The nine-month-old with the beaming smile and emerald eyes was leaping through her milestones: she had taken her first tentative steps, hands clasped to her mother’s, and said her first word: “Dadda”. She tried on sunglasses and a swimsuit for their first family holiday two months later.</p> <p>The following morning, Genevieve’s mother, Katie Wheeler, took her to Tiny Toes nursery for only her second full day. Wheeler told staff that Gigi, as she was known, had been a bit “snotty” but was otherwise fine. And with a goodbye, she said: “I love you, sweetie.”</p> <p>Just over seven hours later, Genevieve was pronounced dead. In what was supposed to be the safest place in the world, she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/apr/16/baby-died-at-stockport-nursery-after-being-left-face-down-court-hears\">strapped face down to a beanbag</a> for an hour and 37 minutes and her cries of distress ignored. She was eventually found lifeless and blue, having died of suffocation.</p> <p>Kate Roughley, the deputy manager of the nursery in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/20/kate-roughley-guilty-killing-nine-month-old-genevieve-meehan-stockport-nursery\">found guilty of manslaughter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/22/kate-roughley-jailed-over-death-of-baby-genevieve-meehan-at-stockport-nursery\">jailed for 14 years</a> after a trial at Manchester crown court. But the fight for justice continues.</p> <p>In their first national newspaper interview, Genevieve’s parents said they had been left distressed and shocked by what they had learned since – about the practices of that nursery but also wider “systemic” safety lapses they believed risked further tragedies in early years settings across the country.</p> <p>John Meehan, Genevieve’s father, said his daughter’s killer would not have been convicted without CCTV footage, which they are now <a href=\"https://campaignforgigi.com/our-campaign/\">campaigning to be made mandatory</a> in nurseries.</p>    <p>Video played in court showed Roughley impatiently handling the baby girl before she died, muttering: “Vile” and singing: “Oh Genevieve. Genevieve go home, Genevieve go home, go home Genevieve,” as the she cried on the play mat.</p> <p>The CCTV also disproved the nursery worker’s claim that she had checked on Genevieve every couple of minutes. And it later led to the conviction of one of Roughley’s colleagues, Rebecca Gregory, for the “deplorable” neglect of four other babies. An ongoing health and safety inquiry could result in further prosecutions.</p> <p>“But for the CCTV, we would have had absolutely no way of knowing about the way Genevieve was placed on a beanbag, about the infrequency of the checks, or about the general conduct towards Genevieve on the day. We really only got an answer because of the CCTV,” said Meehan, 39.</p> <p>This week, Roksana Lecka, 22, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/16/woman-22-convicted-of-abusing-21-babies-at-nursery-where-she-worked\">convicted</a> of abusing 21 babies at a nursery in Twickenham, south-west London, after footage showed the worker pinching and scratching children and kicking one boy in the face. In that case, as Genevieve’s, CCTV was essential to the prosecution.</p>    <p>Meehan said: “Many responsible nurseries are already using CCTV very effectively, so all we’re saying is to make it so that all nurseries have it. It’s good for the nursery, it’s good for the parents, it’s good for Ofsted.”</p> <p>Figures <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0029vnd/how-safe-are-our-nurseries\">obtained by the BBC</a> last year, and described by the couple as “horrifying”, show there were almost 20,000 reports of serious childcare incidents in England’s nurseries in the five years to March 2024 – up 40% on the previous five-year period. The law firm Farleys Solicitors has said the number of legal claims involving injuries to children in nurseries has increased tenfold over the past decade.</p> <p>Wheeler, 40, said Ofsted should be given greater powers to undertake more frequent announced and unannounced inspections of nurseries. At present, the regulator is only obliged to inspect nurseries in England once every six years, compared with once every four academic years for schools.</p> <p>Tiny Toes nursery, where Genevieve was killed, was rated “good” by Ofsted five years earlier, but the trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/20/nursery-death-of-baby-genevieve-meehan-raises-troubling-questions\">heard evidence</a> suggesting it was run “shockingly”. On the day Genevieve died, Roughley was one of only two members of staff looking after 11 babies. The previous weekday there were 16 babies – far in excess of the one-to-three ratio for under-twos in England.</p> <p>“I think the system definitely fails parents,” said Wheeler, who wants Ofsted to increase its number of unannounced inspections – which it currently only does when a specific concern has been raised – and to review CCTV when it is available.</p> <p>“You’re never going to get a true snapshot of what a place is like and how safe it is unless you go out on a no-notice inspection and when you look at it regularly. A lot changes over six years. It’s life and death – and it’s not overstating it to say that.”</p>    <p>Life without Genevieve was “agonisingly painful,” Wheeler said, describing the nine-month-old who relished her world full of cuddles, singing, dancing, food, her favourite green toy tambourine and “her everything”: her big sister, who is now nine.</p> <p>The parents are planning to meet Labour’s early education minister, Stephen Morgan, later this month to press for improved safety in nurseries, including CCTV, more Ofsted inspections and a new legal framework to ban unsafe sleep practices, supported by the Lullaby Trust.</p> <p>Failing to enact the changes, Meehan said, risked further tragedies: “There could be more deaths. There is absolutely that risk.”</p> <p>The Department for Education said it was boosting safety in nurseries with new measures from September, including strengthening whistleblowing and recruitment, but that it would closely monitor whether further changes were needed.</p> <p>It added: “Genevieve’s death was a tragedy and should never have happened. This government is committed to doing everything possible to keep children safe, as part of our mission to break down barriers to opportunity and give every child the best start in life.”</p> <p>Ofsted said it would be inappropriate to comment during an ongoing investigation but that “our thoughts remain with Genevieve’s family and we are deeply sorry for their loss”.</p>",

Yet it was all but impossible not to cast a glance sideways as Brad Pitt nonchalantly strolled out to face the microphones and cameras of his own, entirely staged, media scrum.</p> <p>None of us in the media pack openly goggled at the fact that Hollywood’s A-list had joined the sweaty throng, because Pitt was there filming what would become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt\">F1 the Movie</a>. And we, as with everyone else, were under strict instructions to behave normally.</p> <p>Indeed, as farcical as it might sound, by this point we had become almost inured to the presence of the stars and their crew after several years of being part and parcel of the F1 circus. Almost but not quite. I mean, it <em>was</em> Brad Pitt …</p> <p>The resulting film, released next Wednesday by Apple Studios, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Top Gun: Maverick’s Joseph Kosinski, stars Pitt as the veteran driver Sonny Hayes, who makes a comeback to the sport after a 30-year absence to rescue the ailing and also fictional APX team. The film, which has had <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f1_the_movie\">largely positive reviews</a> so far – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/17/f1-the-movie-review-brad-pitt\">including from the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw</a> – came about through an unusually proactive collaboration between the filmmakers and the sport. F1 bent over backwards to ensure it went well.</p>    <p>The production filmed at circuits on real race weekends for over two years. The APX team enjoyed their own pit garage, their own hospitality and their own uniforms. With Pitt being filmed alongside real drivers and indeed the media around the grid and the “paddock” (the working area of an F1 team), the filmmakers were effectively embedded within the sport as its 11th team – perhaps as deeply as it is possible for an entity to go without actually being a real team.</p> <p>They have also used real cars, albeit less-powerful Formula 2 models modified to look as close as possible to F1 cars by the Mercedes F1 team. Pitt and his co-star Damson Idris have filmed in cars, with Pitt doing all his own driving. He’s been praised by Hamilton for picking up the skills quickly.</p> <p>Hamilton is both one of the producers and a special adviser to ensure the picture is as authentic as possible. For the producers, the collaboration is relatively straightforward. They wanted to make as authoritative, exciting and immersive a film as possible. And for the sport the movie is a key part of its global strategy.</p> <p>For many years F1 enjoyed a strong but undoubtedly niche-based support, largely centred on Europe and with a notably ageing, white-male demographic. But since Liberty Media took over the sport in 2017 from its former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, who had been in charge for nearly 40 years, it has undergone a rapid and dramatic transformation.</p> <p>Liberty has expanded its reach, notably using social media and promotion to actively target a younger, more diverse audience. The enormously successful Netflix series <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80204890\">Drive to Survive</a> followed, its dramatic and sharply edited retelling of each season proving a huge hit with a market previously indifferent to F1. Drive to Survive is now in its seventh season since 2019.</p>    <p>Suddenly the sport had an entirely new, enthusiastic fanbase; younger, excited and building momentum across the world – notably in the market every non US-based sport craves, North America. F1 has moved from one moderately well-attended race in Texas to three sellouts a year, now also including Miami and a night-race promoted by F1 itself on the streets of Las Vegas.</p> <p>Tyler Epp, the Miami GP president, noted that their audience is “growing most aggressively in the 20- and 30-year-old buyer. Our data does not tell us that this is an audience of 30- to 60-year-old white men”. Instead, Epp says, there is a 60-40 male-female split – an “eclectic, diverse group”.</p> <p>Recently, both golf and tennis have tried, with a lesser degree of success, to emulate the enormous surge of interest F1 has enjoyed.</p> <p>F1’s willingness to accommodate Hollywood is shaped by this prism, the film a chance to sell the sport to a potentially huge audience who just might be converted. Sylvester Stallone tried to make an F1 film in the late 1990s but, given a lack of cooperation from Ecclestone, ultimately switched the story to the US-based CART series and the commercial and critical flop Driven was the result.</p> <p>Stefano Domenicali, a former team principal at Ferrari and president of the Italian car manufacturer Lamborghini, is the chief executive of F1, an accomplished operator with an easy-going persona. He is relaxed with F1 teams and Hollywood moguls and has been at the heart of the resurgence. “I think that if Netflix was big, that the movie will be massive,” he said this year. “We’re going to hit a target that is not yet present.”</p>    <p>Purists will sniff at some of the picture’s deviations from certain aspects of F1’s realities, and its concessions to dramatic and narrative convention to propel it as entertainment. But it was meant to be a blockbuster not a documentary and that’s what matters to F1 and the producers.</p> <p>After the film’s screenings in the US, Apple’s senior vice-president, Eddy Cue, said that “very few” of those attending had previously seen an F1 race but their reactions were instructive.</p> <p>“When we finish and we ask how many of you would like to go see a race now, literally every single hand goes up,” he said. “We think there’s a huge, huge opportunity to grow the sport all over the world with this movie and I think it will do that.”</p>",

New compilation Telepathic Fish documents the 90s south London ambient night; Logic1000’s latest DJ-Kicks mix would barely register on an ECG; there’s none more languid than even the summer’s flagship pop album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/06/addison-rae-addison-album-review\">Addison by Addison Rae</a>. New York producer and musician James K has been dabbling in trip-hop – and various shades of experimental pop and club music – for more than a decade, but nonetheless, her new album, Friend, arrives right on time for summer’s wind down. (What is autumn if not the chill out room to escape the year’s most hectic season?)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2chmQiR8R10\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2chmQiR8R10?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>James K: Play – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>While the accompanying text around the record speaks impenetrably of “oneiric fogs” and a “gaseous halo”, its many pleasures are in fact immediate and enveloping. These songs bob along on sleepy breakbeats wreathed in liquid, shoegaze guitar and angelic atmospherics; K’s melancholy falsetto is self-possessed, tracing its own hypnotic path through the blissed-out clouds she spins like candyfloss. (Fans of the more evanescent end of Caroline Polachek’s catalogue will find lots to get lost in.) Over repeat listens, this dreamy record leaves stronger impressions, of soft Balearic ecstasy on Peel; a little dank post-punk on pop gem On God; liturgical awe on Rider. Seductively slow it may be, Friend nevertheless seems primed to accelerate this cult hero’s emergence from the underground. <em>Laura Snapes</em></p> <h2>This week’s best new tracks</h2>    <p><strong>Zuli – Care</strong><br>Following up his acclaimed 2024 album Lambda, the title track of the Egyptian producer’s new EP is skittering, splintered, symphonic trip-hop, with bells and whispers reaching across the uncanny valley. <em>BBT</em></p> <p><strong>Titanic – Gotera</strong><br>Mabe Fratti’s duo with Héctor Tosta returns, channelling the astonishing metal energy of their recent live sets into an epic where Fratti’s ragged voice pierces ceaseless rounds of artillery-fire drums. <em>LS</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/30/sophie-10-of-the-greatest-tracks-by-a-genius-of-pops-expressive-power\">Sophie</a> – Ooh</strong><strong><br></strong>A deep cut from the 10th anniversary reissue of Product: “I’m your Play-Doh baby / Push me to my knees,” a female voice pleads, starkly melancholy against the rubbery bass and ecstatic synth blurts. <em>LS</em></p> <p><strong>Cass McCombs – Peace</strong><strong><br></strong>A riff that’s like sunlight on the broken surface of a pond powers the latest stunner from an artist who, coming up to 12 solo albums, has amassed one of the great bodies of American song. <em>BBT</em></p> <p><strong>Mark William Lewis – Still Above</strong><strong><br></strong>After May’s beautifully brooding Tomorrow Is Perfect, the enigmatic London songwriter lets the light in, splicing strangely sweet, jazzy harmonica into his deep-voiced lyrics on off-kilter relationships, whether narcotic or romantic. <em>LS</em></p> <p><strong>Sombr – We Never Dated</strong><br>The lad with the sharpest cheekbones in pop made the heartbreak anthem of the year with Back to Friends.

Fox chooses his victims carefully: his “little kittens”, all in his preferred 12-to-14 age group, have literary leanings and absent fathers, and feel validated by the attention he pays them. When the parts of Fox’s body that haven’t been consumed by wildlife are pulled out of a local swamp, it falls to world-weary detective Horace Zwender to work out what’s been going on. Peppered with exclamation marks, breathless and febrile, this is an utterly mesmeric account of how one man’s crimes can affect an entire community.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-schooling-in-murder-9780008494230/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">A Schooling in Murder</a> by Andrew Taylor (Hemlock, £20</strong><strong>)<br></strong>Taylor’s latest also centres on an educational establishment, Monkshill Park School for Girls, a crumbling mansion in Monmouthshire, Wales. It’s the end of the second world war, the country is exhausted, and several inhabitants are waiting for news of loved ones who are missing, perhaps dead. Also missing is teacher Annabel Warnock, who disappeared during the Easter holidays. It’s presumed that “Warnie” simply walked out on her job, but she remembers being shoved off a nearby cliff. Now a trapped spirit, she is determined to discover who killed her and, able to move about the school and grounds unobserved, finds herself privy to all sorts of secrets. Taylor’s ability to conjure time past is second to none and here he blends a school story for adults, a ghost story and a mystery for a sublime evocation of a closed world in which the adults are, in their way, as powerless as their young charges.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/death-of-a-diplomat-9781408732472/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Death of a Diplomat</a> by Eliza Reid (Sphere, £20</strong><strong>)<br></strong>Reid is a former first lady of Iceland, and her debut novel is set on Heimaey, the largest of that country’s Westman Islands. Canadian ambassador Graeme Shearer and his wife Jane are paying a visit with the dual purpose of opening an art exhibition and forging business links with a large fishery. Beneath the standard-issue speechifying, subtle power plays and general buttering up, trouble is brewing. Not only is the island’s mayor grieving the unexpected death of his husband, but the Shearers’ marriage is in crisis and the increasingly stormy weather means that the island is isolated until further notice – and then deputy ambassador Kavita Banerjee is felled by a poisoned “Flaming Viking” cocktail. Told from multiple points of view, the story rewinds to 13 hours before Kavita’s death, before taking us forward to the projected killing of an unnamed second person. Despite a fair bit of exposition, this classic “closed world” mystery moves at a good pace, making excellent use of its claustrophobic setting and delivering a final sucker-punch twist.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/actually-im-a-murderer-9781408720103/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Actually, I’m a Murderer</a> by Terry Deary (Constable, £18.99</strong><strong>)<br></strong>The Horrible Histories writer’s first novel for adults begins in 1973, when four strangers meet on an early morning train from London to Newcastle upon Tyne. There’s Tony, a struggling actor; Claire, who works in the fledgling computer industry; Edward, prosperous lawyer and adviser to the prime minister, Edward Heath; and last “Mr Brown”, who tells his new acquaintances “Actually, I’m a murderer”. In the next few days, one of the company will be killed, another will turn to blackmail, and a third will be forced to commit a crime … All this is recounted 50 years later by Tony, the professional killer and self-styled sociopath “Mr Brown”, and police officer Aline James. It’s by no means all hijinks – the institutional misogyny young Aline has to contend with rings appallingly true – but this smart, funny and deftly executed page turner is sure to please.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/can-you-solve-the-murder-9780857506931/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Can You Solve the Murder?</a> by Antony Johnston (Bantam, £14.99</strong><strong>)<br></strong>“Solve it yourself” titles aren’t new. In the 1930s, Dennis Wheatley’s “murder dossiers” came complete with clues ranging from telegrams and photographs of cigarette ends to little bags containing human hair, and in recent years the Murdle puzzle collections have become a publishing phenomenon, but a superior interactive crime story is always a delight. This is Cluedo-type detective fiction in which you, the reader, are the presiding DCI, presented in “choose your own adventure” gamebook style. In order to solve the murder of property developer Harry Kennedy, whose corpse has been discovered at the luxurious Elysium spa, you must choose which of the available suspects to interview and which locations to explore, with each decision leading you to a fork in the narrative road as the chapters fan out to a series of different conclusions, only one of which is correct. Park your need for emotional resonance and sharpen your wits: this clever, intricate book is a highly entertaining mental workout.</p>",

I needed to move home’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Chelsea goalkeeper was asked at England’s pre-Euros media day at St George’s Park whether she was surprised by Earps’s announcement and whether they had spoken. “First of all we have to respect what her decision is,” Hampton said. “There’s been quite a bit of scrutiny that she probably doesn’t deserve with everything that she’s achieved in the game and put women’s goalkeeping on the map for the younger generation. It was never really a thing, and Mary’s changed that.</p> <p>“I think I’ve done everything I need to do: I’ve sent her a text and I congratulated her on a very successful international career and I think that’s all I really can do. I don’t think there’s anything else and I’m not expecting anything back. She’s been an unbelievable player. We’re going to miss her here. She’s a big personality in this team and she glued us all together at times when we needed to. It’s been difficult for everyone to come to terms with her decision, but we have to respect that. Now I have got to just go and live up to her legacy. But I’ll give it my best shot.”</p>    <p>These Euros will be the first time the 24-year-old has been thrust into the spotlight, although she was part of the Lionesses squads for Euro 2022 and the 2023 World Cup. She has 15 caps and seven clean sheets, having made her debut in 2022. Asked how it felt to be the first-choice No 1, Hampton said: “Just getting that bit of clarity already helps you prepare for whatever your role is. My role is different this time around compared to the last tournaments but it’s not going to change my mindset. I’m there to enjoy myself, do the nation proud with all the girls and get memories.”</p> <p>As a child Hampton was diagnosed with an eye condition that affected her depth perception but, after surgeries, she remained determined to pursue a career as a goalkeeper. “I’ve always gone through life trying to prove people wrong,” she said. “I was told from a young age that I couldn’t play football, that it wouldn’t be a profession I could pursue – the doctors told my parents that. I’m here right now.”</p>",

I’ve selected 10 of the best camping tents to suit every adventure, from ultralight backpacking tents to more spacious family tents.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>At a glance</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best tent overall:</strong><br>MSR Hubba Hubba NX<br><a href=\"https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-tent-D1312362.html\"><sub>£476 at Cotswold Outdoors</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best budget tent:<br></strong>Easy Camp Sarek 2<br><a href=\"https://ligo.co.uk/products/easy-camp-sarek-2-2-person-tent\"><sub>£89.95 at Ligo</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best family tent:</strong> <br>Outwell Montana 4 Air<br><a href=\"https://www.outdooraction.co.uk/outwell-montana-4-air-tent-2025-p22655/s120164\"><sub>£849.95 at Outdoor Action</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best four-person tent:</strong> <br>Big Agnes Big House<br><a href=\"https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/big-agnes-big-house-4-4-person-tent-bf/\"><sub>£412.39 at Alpinetrek</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best bell tent:<br></strong>Boutique Camping Luna Bell<br><a href=\"https://boutiquecamping.com/products/luna-bell-tent\"><sub>From £409 at Boutique Camping</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’m a seasoned camper. I love wild adventures on my own with a backpacking tent, but equally love long weekends spent in a palatial bell tent with family and friends in a sunny field, packing everything but the kitchen sink. I’m also a festival frequenter each summer. As an outdoors journalist, I’ve tested hundreds of tents in rain and shine over the years – and I think the options below are the best picks for every kind of camper.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>I put these tents through their paces over a few weeks in mercurial May weather. I slept in each tent for a few nights at campsites (and in my friend’s handy field) in a mixed bag of weather conditions. I looked for easy, quick pitching and simple-to-follow instructions, space inside each model for people and kit, and that perfect balance of good waterproofing to guard against wet weather and decent ventilation for more balmy days.</p> <p>I also checked if each tent really could sleep the stated number of people it advertised in comfort. I had plenty of help from my husband, outdoorsy friends and my toddler, who rates all these tents as playrooms, and tested a few for durability too.</p> <p>I’ve owned some of my top-recommended tents for years, so I can personally attest to their endurance. As well as recommending tents based on their quality, waterproofing and hardiness, I also looked for variety – I’ve included a great bell tent, backpacking tent, family tent and budget options to suit all sorts of adventures under canvas.<strong> </strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best tents for camping</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best</em><em> tent overall</em><em>:<br></em><strong>MSR Hubba Hubba NX</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-tent-D1312362.html\"><sub>£476 at Cotswold Outdoors</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://valleyandpeak.co.uk/products/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-tent\"><sub>£476 at Valley and Peak</sub></a></p> <p>MSR’s adventurous tents are a bit of a cult classic in the camping world for their light weight, durability and weatherproofing, and you’ll spot them everywhere from lonely mountain passes to moorland campsites. The brand’s bestselling Hubba Hubba is aimed firmly at backpackers – it’s lightweight and compact, but with plenty of space for two.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>All the MSR tents I’ve tested over the years have proved well made and durable, and are worth the money if you’re looking for something that will see you through years of adventuring. The Hubba Hubba is my pick of its backpacking offerings, and this NX model is pleasingly quick and simple to pitch – even on your own – with poles that click together easily and hold their shape brilliantly, even in heavy winds.</p>    <p>The inside of the Hubba Hubba is roomy (the mesh material keeps bugs at bay), with plenty of space for two people plus gear, and the porch area provides even more space for spare kit or muddy boots. The whole thing is quick to pack down and fits easily into a rucksack. I’ve used the original Hubba Hubba for hundreds of nights under the stars, and it’s<strong> </strong>stood the test of time superbly.

Its compact pack size easily fits into panniers or a rucksack, and it includes thoughtful features such as a gear hook for bike helmets and even a drying line for wet clothing.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The Sarek 2 punches above its price point in lots of areas. It’s made of lightweight yet durable polyester fabrics, and boasts robust 3,000mm waterproofing, which I found kept the rain at bay reliably well – even during an all-night downpour. Colour-coded poles make setup quick and intuitive.</p>    <p>This tunnel-style tent has a low profile, and while it technically sleeps two, there’s limited room for kit, so it’s better suited for one person. Note too that head height is limited, with not much room inside for anything but sleeping. Nevertheless, if you’re travelling solo, the Sarek 2 is a good deal.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>head height is limited.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> two-person<br><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.2kg<br><strong>Dimensions packed:</strong> 46 x 12cm<br><strong>Dimensions up:</strong> 260 x 170 x 95cm<br><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> 3,000mm</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best family tent:</em> <br><strong>Outwell Montana 4 Air</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.outdooraction.co.uk/outwell-montana-4-air-tent-2025-p22655/s120164\"><sub>£849.95 at Outdoor Action</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.diy.com/departments/outwell-montana-4-person-air-tent/5709388144461_BQ.prd\"><sub>£849.99 at B&amp;Q</sub></a></p> <p>Outwell’s Montana 4 Air has proven popular with families since its launch, thanks to inflatable poles, lots of living space and a highly waterproof outer fly.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Recreate your home sitting room inside the roomy Montana, which has an airy living space to hang out in as well as two blackout bedrooms. These work well when shared<strong> </strong>by a family of four, keeping little campers in the dark well past daybreak. Big windows and a porch made this tent far less claustrophobic to spend time in during spells of bad weather than most models I tested. I also liked the wide main door and additional side door for ventilation on warm days and easy coming and going.</p>    <p>I found pitching the Montana 4 Air fiddly – it’s best attempted by two people – and it’s heavy at 23kg, despite the inflatable “air” poles. This tent had one of the highest waterproof ratings I tested at 6,000mm, and it was reassuringly waterproof in heavy rain. It also felt reasonably windproof considering its larger size.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>putting it up is a little fiddly.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> four-person<br><strong>Weight:</strong> 23kg <br><strong>Dimensions packed:</strong> 97 x 47 x 43cm <br><strong>Dimensions up:</strong> 510 x 220 x 350cm<br><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> 6,000mm</p> <h2>***</h2> <h2><em>Best four-person tent:</em> <br><strong>Big Agnes Big House</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/big-agnes-big-house-4-4-person-tent-bf/\"><sub>£412.39 at Alpinetrek</sub></a></p> <p>All-American brand Big Agnes (it’s named after a mountain in Colorado) created the Big House for car campers who are packing all their weekend’s kit in the boot. This family-friendly, four-person tent is lightweight and portable, with enough headroom to stand fully upright in.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Big Agnes’s tents and outdoor gear might be expensive, but it shows in the quality of its looks and finish. Pitching is quick and easy, thanks to three intuitive poles that clip together and hold their shape well. While a porch for storing kit would have been useful, there are plenty of pockets inside for bits and bobs – plus you get proper standing height here, which feels revolutionary for a compact tent. At 5.7kg, this tent is too heavy for backpacking, although the carry case is helpful for lugging it from the<strong> </strong>car to where you might be pitching.</p> <p>Its 1,500mm of waterproofing kept me dry in wet May weather, while the mesh kept air moving in hot spells. This tent is marketed as four-person, but we’d say it’s more comfortable for three if camping for more than a night or two. Go for the six-person if there are four of you. All in all, a nice all-rounder for weekends away, car camping and festivals.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>if it’s more than a few nights, it will be a bit of a squeeze for four.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> four-person<strong><br></strong><strong>Weight:</strong> 5.7kg <br><strong>Dimensions packed:</strong> 18 x 41 x 66cm<br><strong>Dimensions up:</strong> 230 x 220 x 180cm<br><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> 1,500mm</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best bell tent:</em> <br><strong>Boutique Camping </strong><strong>Luna Bell</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://boutiquecamping.com/products/luna-bell-tent\"><sub>From £409 at Boutique Camping</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/4m-luna-bell-tent-oxford-ultralite-100gsm-p52661.aspx/\"><sub>£421 at Mountain Warehouse</sub></a></p> <p>Boutique Camping stocks a range of canvas and polycotton glamping tents and tipis, with the Luna Bell among its most popular designs. It has wide windows, lots of headroom and enough space for a proper bed, if kipping on the ground isn’t your thing.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>For years now, my own Luna Bell has been a constant companion at festivals, weddings and family camps over summer. This tipi-style tent offers lots of room for three or four campers to share, with tons of head space and big circular windows that give it a light and airy feel inside. </p> <p>It’s made from weather-resistant polycotton, which means it’s not fully waterproof, and so is best used in summer – and if it does get wet, you’ll need to ensure it’s properly dry before storing. The Luna Bell is heavy, and it will require two people to put up; but good guy ropes and aluminium poles make the whole thing feel reassuringly sturdy once it is up. I own the four-metre Luna Bell, but five-, six- and seven-metre versions are also available.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>it’s heavy and bulky, plus there’s only one room.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> four-person<br><strong>Weight:</strong> 16kg <br><strong>Dimensions packed:</strong> 95 x 28 x 28cm <br><strong>Dimensions up:</strong> 250 x 400cm<br><strong>Waterproofing:</strong> water-resistant polycotton</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best of the rest</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Eurohike Genus 400</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.ultimateoutdoors.com/15982377/eurohike-genus-400-air-tent-15982377/1982886\"><sub>£229 at Ultimate Outdoors</sub></a><sub> <br></sub><a href=\"https://www.millets.co.uk/15982377/eurohike-genus-400-air-tent-15982377\"><sub>£254 at Millets</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Best for:</strong> an affordable inflatable tent</p> <p>Inflatable tents can be life-changing for family camping trips – instead of fiddling for hours with heavy canvas and unwieldy poles, you can just inflate the beams of your new portable palace and then relax. The downside is that “air” tents can be pretty pricey, but Easy Camp’s Genus 400 can currently be picked up for the reduced price of £229. This four-person tent is big and roomy, but its weight is perfectly portable. Plus, it’s simple to pitch – on test, it took about 25 minutes to get it up and ready for use with the included pump. </p> <p>Step inside and you’ll find a large bedroom, a living area with big windows, and a porch. Only the living room offers standing height, and it’s a pity the bedroom can’t be divided so that kids can have their own room. Nevertheless, this is still a good-quality air tent if you fancy giving inflatable tents a try without blowing<strong> </strong>your budget.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because … </strong>there’s only one bedroom.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> four-person; <strong>weight:</strong> 9.8kg; <strong>dimensions packed:</strong> 73 x 35 x 28cm; <strong>dimensions up:</strong> 450 x 190 x 250cm; <strong>waterproofing:</strong> 3,000mm</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Vango Savannah Air 600XL</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.outdooraction.co.uk/vango-savannah-air-600xl-tent-p23717/s124986\"><sub>£899.95 at Outdoor Action</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/vango/vango-savannah-air-600xl-tent-package/_/R-p-c96c192a-e59a-43e3-98c9-5fabdc685808\"><sub>£899.99 at Decathlon</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Best for:</strong> a six-person tent</p> <p>I’ve always found that Vango tents offer decent bang for your buck, and the Savannah Air is one of the best larger inflatable tents around.

It took me about 20 minutes to pitch, although you’ll need two people to lug it all into place.</p> <p>This tent sleeps six in three bedrooms, although it would prove nice and spacious for a family of four or five, with room to spare for all your belongings.

Then get yourself a pop-up one. Decathlon’s 2 Seconds is surprisingly sturdy, offers decent waterproofing, and really does take only a few seconds to pop up and peg into place. Free this circular design of its straps, and it springs into shape instantly, forming a roomy tent for one or two. It’s lined with blackout material, which keeps the tent cool and dark for longer – great for lie-ins at festivals, or for attempting to stop little ones from waking up at the crack of dawn.</p> <p>If only it were as easy to take down as it is to put up – I had to watch the instruction video multiple times to get the folding technique down. Note, too, that pop-up tents are less windproof and durable than traditional designs.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because … </strong>space is limited, and it’s tricky to fold down.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> three-person; <strong>weight:</strong> 4.9kg; <strong>dimensions packed:</strong> 86 x 10cm; <strong>dimensions up:</strong> 109 x 88 x 180cm; <strong>waterproofing:</strong> 2,000mm</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Coleman Cortes Octagon</strong></h2>    <p><a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/camping/all-camping/cortes-octagon-8-person-tent---blue-280803.html\"><sub>£250 at Halfords</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coleman-Festival-standing-waterproof-groundsheet/dp/B01M9FFOU9\"><sub>From £224.98 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p><strong>Best for:</strong> a festival</p> <p>The rather futuristic-looking Coleman Cortes Octagon is as fun to camp in as it looks, although it can be fiddly to put up until you’ve pitched it a few times. Inside, one huge octagonal room offers up an airy living space – although this might make it unsuitable for families where individuals need their own space.</p> <p>Those who aren’t fans of dark, cramped tents will love this tent’s generous standing room and wall-to-wall windows, which can be fully opened and offer a 360-degree view. The Octagon also works brilliantly as a playhouse in the garden or as a beach shelter.

This eye-catching tipi-style tent sleeps up to 10 in one huge central space, and there’s plenty of head height. The polycotton material looks like canvas but is breathable and fully waterproof (unlike most glamping-style tents, which are often just water-resistant), and it has huge windows with mesh panels and privacy curtains, so you can let the light in during the day or even do a spot of stargazing at night.</p> <p>Pitching this behemoth was surprisingly easy, but do note that it’s heavy to transport and cumbersome to store. For glampers, bell tent gatherings in the back garden or festival fun in groups, the Settler Sky would be worth the splurge.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> it’s eye-wateringly expensive.</p> <p><strong>Tent size:</strong> 10-person; <strong>weight:</strong> 26.3kg; <strong>dimensions packed:</strong> 33 x 33 x 95cm; <strong>dimensions up:</strong> 500 x 460cm; <strong>waterproofing:</strong> 10,000mm</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>What you need to know</strong></h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>How can I tell if a tent is waterproof?</h2> <p>Bad weather can make or break a camping trip, so it’s important to pay attention to the specs when making your choice. Look for a “twin skin” tent – this means it has a separate inner layer and an outer “flysheet” layer – and pick a model that has a fully waterproof fly (outer layer).</p> <p>The waterproof rating will sometimes be listed as a “hydrostatic head” (HH) rating, a measure of how waterproof a tent’s fabric is. It’s expressed in millimetres (as listed underneath each product above) and indicates the amount of water pressure the fabric can withstand before it starts to leak. For example, a 1,500mm HH rating means the fabric can hold a 1.5-metre column of water before leaking. Generally, 1,000–1,500mm is suitable for light rain, 1,500mm is waterproof and above 3,000mm is highly waterproof and more suitable for winter or mountain conditions.</p> <p>If you’re buying a canvas tent, look for one that’s made with water-resistant polycotton. Good tents have built-in waterproof nylon groundsheets, which stop any wet seeping in from the ground.</p> <h2>What features should I look for?</h2> <p>Think about how and where you want to use your new tent. For a multi-week family camping trip with the car, the size and weight of a large tent with multiple rooms or a canvas glamping tent will be worth the roomy living space you’ll get in return. Big family tents have traditionally been a nightmare to erect, but there are now more “air” tents coming on to the market, which you can inflate with a pump. Those with children might be better going for a two-bedroom tent, to ensure you all get a good night’s sleep, and one made with blackout material to stop little ones waking up at dawn. If you’re just off for a weekend, look for more compact models, and if you want to carry your tent any distance backpacking or bikepacking, pick something that weighs 4kg or less.</p> <h2>How many people does a tent really sleep?</h2> <p>Be wary of the number of people a tent claims to sleep – I’d advise you halve that number if you don’t fancy sleeping like sardines. Solo campers will find a one- or two-person tent fine, while a six-person model will make a good fit for a family of two adults and two or three children, with plenty of space left over for cooking gear and clothing. If you’re shopping for a family tent, look for multiple bedrooms and a roomy porch, so there’s plenty of space for storing kit or to sit under shelter.</p> <h2>How to clean and store your tent to make it last longer – and recycle it when it’s time to replace</h2> <p>Store your tent indoors somewhere cool and dry when not in use. Tents can go mouldy or end up smelling musty in storage, so make sure they’re bone-dry before packing away. If you’ve just returned from a swampy trip to Glastonbury, scrub off any mud and dirt with a damp, soapy sponge, then hand-wash your tent’s outer and inner flies in a bath filled with warm water, using a technical tent wash <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nikwax-Tent-SolarWash-Spray-Clear/dp/B0719BHDP1\">such as this one from Nikwax</a>. Rinse well, then erect your tent outdoors on a warm day, out of direct sunlight, and leave until fully dry. If you own a canvas glamping tent, consider sending it off for a professional clean every few years.</p> <p>When you get to the point of replacement, recycle your current tent at a household waste centre, or if it’s still functional, donate it to charity or give it away on a local freebie group such as <a href=\"https://www.freecycle.org/\">Freecycle</a>. If you buy a Decathlon brand tent this summer, such as the <a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/camping-tent-2-seconds-3-person-freshandblack/_/R-p-346717\">Quecha pop-up</a> featured above, you’ll be able to return it at any point until 14 September as part of the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/c/htc/no-tent-left-behind_b3be522a-a5f2-497e-a93f-f1a3682cdae1\">No Tent Left Behind campaign</a> – useful for any festivals. </p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Sian Lewis is an award-winning </em><em>outdoors and travel journalist and author who loves putting adventure kit through its paces while hiking, swimming and wild camping.

By the time he painted this, in the final decade of his long life, he had seen and painted so much. He throws away big ambitions, watches this tender moment between mother and baby, and paints with soft, expressive reverence. Yet there’s another side to it: the composition echoes his rival Michelangelo, who had recently died. For decades these last surviving giants of the high Renaissance had looked at and tried to outdo one another, but here, perhaps, Titian pays tribute to Michelangelo as he breathes a prayer for them both.<br>• <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-the-virgin-suckling-the-infant-christ\">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email\">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href=\"mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com\">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>",

            "body" : "<p>Amid controversial dismissals for independent advisers and staff at health agencies, alongside lackluster responses to the bird flu and measles outbreaks, experts fear the US is now in worse shape to respond to a pandemic than before 2020.</p> <p>H5N1, which has received less attention under the Trump administration than from Biden’s team, is not the only influenza virus or even the only variant of bird flu with the potential to spark a pandemic. But a subpar response to the ongoing US outbreak signals a larger issue: America is not ready for whatever pathogen will sweep through next.</p> <p>“We have not even remotely maintained the level of pandemic preparedness – which needed a lot of work, as we saw from the Covid pandemic,” said Angela Rasmussen, an American virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “But now, we essentially have no pandemic preparedness.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/bird-flu-us-poultry-farms-vaccines\">Bird flu reinfections at US poultry farms highlight need for vaccines, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m concerned on a number of fronts,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.</p> <p>Those concerns include a lack of quality information from officials, weakened virus monitoring systems, and public health reductions at the federal, state and local levels.</p> <p>“The thing that I am most concerned about is the veracity of information coming out of the health agencies,” Nuzzo said.</p> <p>In the ongoing outbreaks of measles, for example, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of health and human services, has downplayed the severity of the disease, spread misinformation about the highly effective vaccine to prevent measles, and pushed unproven treatments.</p> <p>“The communications on measles gives me deep worries about what would happen in a pandemic,” Nuzzo said. “If a pandemic were to occur today, the only thing we would have to protect ourselves on day one would be information.”</p> <p>The H5N1 outbreak has been plagued by incomplete information, an issue that began in the Biden administration but has amplified under Trump.</p> <p>In Arizona, 6 million chickens were killed or culled at a Hickman’s Family Farms location because of H5N1 in May. That’s about 95% of the company’s hen population in the state. Hundreds of workers, including inmate laborers, are now being <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/southwest-valley/2025/05/30/6-million-hickmans-chickens-die-because-of-bird-flu/83949230007/\">dismissed</a> as Arizona braces for egg shortages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We’re not testing – it’s not that there are no new cases</p> <footer> <cite>Angela Rasmussen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet even as H5N1 outbreaks continue to spread on farms and wreak havoc on the food supply, no new bird flu cases have been reported in people for months.</p> <p>“I am concerned that we may not be finding new infections in humans,” Nuzzo said – and a lack of testing may be the culprit.</p> <p>“We’re not testing – it’s not that there are no new cases,” Rassmussen said.</p> <p>The last bird flu case in a person was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250223111255/https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html\">listed</a> by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 23 February.</p> <p>At that point, at least 830 people in the US had been tested after contact with sick animals. This kind of testing – monitoring the health of people who regularly work with H5N1-infected animals – is how the vast majority of cases (64 out of 70) have been found in this outbreak.</p> <p>But then, several CDC officials overseeing the bird flu response were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-health-layoffs-include-staff-overseeing-bird-flu-response-source-says-2025-04-01/\">fired</a> on 1 April.</p> <p>Since then, only about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html\">50 people</a> in the US have been tested after exposure to sick animals – and no positive cases have been announced.</p> <p>It’s also been difficult to understand the extent of the outbreak and how the virus spreads among animals.</p> <p>“We still just don’t have a good picture of the scope and scale of this outbreak – we never really have. And until we have that, we’re not going to be able to contain it,” Rasmussen said.</p> <p>“It’s extremely bad,” she continued. “We don’t have any information about what’s happening right now. The next pandemic could be starting, and we just don’t know where that’s happening, and we don’t have any ability to find out.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We’re seeing health departments scrambling. That infrastructure is just dramatically eroding</p> <footer> <cite>Jennifer Nuzzo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Huge reductions in the public health workforce and resources has led to less monitoring of outbreaks, known as disease surveillance.</p> <p>“Cutting back on that surveillance is leaving us more in the dark,” Nuzzo said.</p> <p>The CDC clawed back $11.4bn in Covid funding in March. This funding was used to monitor, test, vaccinate and otherwise respond to public health issues at the state, local, territorial and tribal level.</p> <p>“We’re seeing health departments scrambling,” Nuzzo said. “That infrastructure is just dramatically eroding.”</p> <p>International monitoring programs to address outbreaks before they expand across borders have also been cancelled.</p> <p>“We have taken for granted all of those protections, and I fear that we are poised to see the consequences,” Nuzzo said.</p> <p>Trump’s crackdown on immigration also poses a major challenge in detecting cases and treating patients during outbreaks.</p> <p>“A lot of the people who are most at risk are strongly disincentivized to report any cases, given that many of them are undocumented or are not US citizens,” Rasmussen said. “Nobody wants to go get tested if they’re going to end up in an Ice detention facility.”</p> <p>When cases are not detected, that means patients are not able to access care.</p> <p>Although it’s rare for people to become sick with H5N1, for instance – the virus is still primarily an avian, not a human, influenza – this variant of bird flu has a 52% mortality rate globally among people with known infections.</p> <p>Allowing a deadly virus to spread and mutate under the radar has troubling implications for its ability to change into a human influenza without anyone knowing.</p> <p>And if such changes were detected, widening gaps in communication could be the next hurdle for preventing a pandemic, Nuzzo said.</p> <p>“Communication is our most important public health intervention. People, in order to be able to know how to protect themselves, need to have access to facts, and they need to believe in the messengers. And the communication around the measles outbreaks are deeply eroding our standing with the American people.”</p> <p>Even stockpiled vaccines and other protective measures, like personal protective equipment, take time to distribute, Nuzzo added. “And flu is a fast-moving disease that could cause a lot of damage in the months it would take to mount a vaccination campaign.”</p> <p>The US government’s cancellation of its $766m contract with Moderna to research and develop an H5N1 vaccine also signals a concerning strategy from health officials, Nuzzo and Rasmussen said.</p> <p>Other restrictions on vaccine development, like a new plan to test all vaccines against saline placebos, is “going to make it extremely difficult to approve any new vaccine” and would “have a devastating impact on our ability to respond to a potential pandemic”, Rasmussen said – especially in a rapidly moving pandemic where speed matters.</p> <p>“You don’t have time for that if this virus causes a human-to–human outbreak,” Rasmussen said.</p> <p>All of these policies mean the US is less prepared for a pandemic than it was in 2020, she said. And it also means there will be preventable suffering now, even before the next big one strikes.</p> <p>“We are actively making people less safe, less healthy and more dead,” Rasmussen said.</p>",

He allegedly physically shook a lower-ranking female editor in the newsroom in 2024, the industry website reported.</p> <p>Frediani, a former ITV News executive, has also faced allegations of shouting and swearing at colleagues, according to media reports. The BBC presenter Naga Munchetty has reportedly raised concerns about his conduct.</p> <p>In April the BBC published the findings of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/28/bbc-powerful-figures-can-make-life-unbearable-colleagues-chair\">independent review</a> into its workplace culture, which found that some staff believed there were a minority of people – on- and off-air – who were in effect allowed to behave unacceptably. It found that the BBC did not have a toxic workplace culture but said it must intervene earlier when allegations of inappropriate behaviour emerge.</p> <p>The corporation’s chair, Samir Shah, told staff as the review was published: “There is a minority of people whose behaviour is simply not acceptable. And there are still places where powerful individuals – on and off-screen – can abuse that power to make life for their colleagues unbearable.”</p> <p>Last month Frediani accepted a Bafta award when Breakfast won best TV news coverage for a special episode about the Post Office scandal. He has not commented on the allegations.</p> <p>The BBC spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on individual cases, we take all complaints about conduct at work extremely seriously and will not tolerate behaviour that is not in line with our values. We have robust processes in place and would encourage any staff with concerns to raise them directly with us so they can be addressed.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 June 2025. An earlier version said that the BBC had appointed the consultancy firm PwC to review the culture at the BBC One show based in Salford; in fact, it has appointed an HR adviser from the firm.</p>",

This is because their habitats in scrubby areas have been destroyed and thousands are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/02/turtle-doves-to-be-shot-for-sport-again-across-europe-as-eu-lifts-hunting-ban\">shot on their migratory route</a> across Europe.</p> <p>But their distinctive purr can now be heard on estates in Somerset, Exeter, Suffolk, Lincolnshire and Norfolk as an audacious plan to breed and release hundreds of birds gets off the ground.</p> <p>King Charles has become involved by allowing the <a href=\"https://turtledovetrust.org.uk/\">Turtle Dove Trust</a> to build an aviary on <a href=\"https://sandringhamestate.co.uk/turtle-doves-trust/\">his Sandringham estate</a>. He can enjoy the sight of 200 birds when he visits because he is using his land as a breeding ground. The estate says the land is ideal because its coppices, meadows, ponds and waterways are a suitable habitat for the birds as well as rich in food.</p> <p>Ben Goldsmith, a conservationist and financier, has been working with the trust to release 200 birds on his Somerset farm this year. </p> <p>“Where I am in Somerset, no turtle doves have been seen in living memory,” Goldsmith said. “None of my neighbours ever remember seeing turtle doves there. Now, all of our oak trees seem to have a pair of turtle doves purring away. It makes me supremely happy. It’s as if this sound was designed to calm the human soul.”</p> <p>He obtained his doves from Trevor and Deborah Lay, who for years ran a breeding business, selling swans, cranes and other birds across Europe. However, bird flu and Brexit meant they had to shut this down because it became impossible for them to export. Instead, the couple have been using their skills to breed hundreds of turtle doves for the trust at their Suffolk base.</p> <p>Last year, they reared 800 young doves, most of which have been given out to aviaries across the country.</p> <p>Trevor Lay thinks the birds migrate to Africa and back and this year has a chance to prove it: “This year we fixed trackers on 20 birds so that hopefully this autumn we will be able to see the birds flying, migrating. They are nesting locally too. They have spread out around the area and we have had a lot of sightings reported of our birds on our website.”</p> <p>Because of their rapid decline, Lay believes it is imperative to breed and release the birds now, before they vanish from the English countryside completely: “Farmers have been improving their land for turtle doves in the last decade, planting wildflowers and hedges. We are putting them back so everybody can see, hear and enjoy them again sooner and hopefully in their lifetimes and not in 50 or 100 years. We wanted to put something back.</p> <p>“They are lovely little birds – they are beautiful – and this is something we can do to help them.”</p> <p>If the hundreds released each year do well, the project could rapidly scale up the turtle dove population.</p> <p>Goldsmith has been enjoying their return to his land: “You find yourself outside on a summer’s day and all you hear is the purring of turtle doves singing to each other. They always move in pairs and take every opportunity to kiss and preen each other. I knew they were a symbol of love but now I really know why.”</p> <p>He wants everyone to be able to experience this wonder: “Now I realise what we have lost – it’s a birthright that’s been robbed from us. I can’t believe I’d never heard them before and this was the sound our ancestors heard as the sound of summer in England. The bird is on the brink of disappearing so we need to roll the dice and have a go, and just get on and do it and release them.”</p> <p>Lay agreed: “We have the advantage of doing it on a shoestring and getting on with it and not having to spend decades doing feasibility schemes like some larger nature organisations have to. The environment is so much better than it was 10, 20 years ago because of what farmers have been doing to improve their land for wildlife and nature. So we are putting that nature back.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It’s almost 50 years since one of the strangest records ever made was launched – not into the pop charts but into the farthest reaches of outer space. Known as the Golden Record, this 12-inch, gold-plated copper disc was an album compiled by astronomer Carl Sagan featuring everything from classical music and spoken-word greetings to the sounds of nature and a blast of Chuck Berry’s Jonny B Goode. Humans could enjoy it, of course, but they weren’t the target audience. Rather, a copy was placed on Voyager 1 and 2, the two space probes launched in 1977, in the hope that they would one day be discovered and listened to by an alien life form.</p>    <p>The Golden Record came with various diagrammatic instructions on how to play it correctly. But as to what aliens might make of Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto, the sounds of humpback whales and a greeting in the Chinese dialects Wu, we will never know. Both Voyager probes are still intact, currently hurtling through the Kuiper belt in interstellar space, but we are likely to lose contact with them in around a decade’s time. This means we will miss the Golden Record’s first realistic chance of being discovered – when it’s expected to pass within 1.6 light years of the star Gliese 445 in 40,000 years’ time.</p> <p>And yet the record continues to inspire. It’s certainly the key influence behind Earth Rising: Messages from the Pale Blue Dot, the first in a series of three audio works by arts organisation Artangel that are being released on digital platforms in the run-up to the Golden Record’s 50th anniversary.</p> <p>“I visit artist studios and hear what they’re grappling with,” says Artangel director Mariam Zulfiqar. “They worry about what digital technology has done to human connection, this looming fear of climate, the state of geopolitics. Yet, within that fear, is also an enormous hope for what they believe humanity could be – and a desire to keep making new work that shows us a different perspective on ourselves.”</p>    <p>Zulfiqar has been fascinated with the Golden Record ever since she was a child growing up in Pakistan. “To send this out there without knowing what would happen is quite romantic, especially in today’s outcome-driven world,” she says. So she came up with an idea: what if we made a modern version of the Golden Record that was less concerned with introducing ourselves to aliens and more about introducing humanity to itself? She got to work inviting artists from around the world to contribute.</p> <p>The result is a collection of poems and experimental compositions that grapple with our present moment. Sebastián Riffo Valdebenito creates a track from the sounds of rock carving at the petroglyph site of Valle del Encanto in Coquimbo, Chile, while Michel Nieva contributes The Alien Mother, a short story set in a future where humanity has colonised Mars. Elsewhere, there are poems about US turmoil, ethereal songs created using just the human voice, and what is described as a “sonic invocation” that honours the calabash, a hard-shelled type of fruit used to make instruments. It’s almost as diverse and confounding as the Golden Record itself which, along with its various audio recordings, featured 115 images encoded in analogue form (a circle, a track athlete, etc) and a condensed recording of Sagan’s wife’s brainwaves, captured while she thought deeply about the Earth’s history and various human experiences such as falling in love (I’d like to see you work that one out, aliens!).</p>    <p>“What surprised me is the connections,” says Zulfiqar. “There’s a beautiful line in Nigerian poet Ofem Ubi’s piece Family Tree that says, ‘In my attempts at tethering, I have loved many people, countries, ghosts.’ That sense of lost love is echoed in some of the other works. Similarly, Emilia Álvarez and Max Cooper both made music using sounds from the human body.”</p> <p>The latter’s track, Rhythm of Harmony (A Representation of Music), is the contribution most likely to have worked on the original LP. Inspired by some of the more withering responses to the Golden Record by philosophers of the time, who mocked the idea that other life forms would have a clue how to read the instructions, never mind appreciate, say, the traditional Aboriginal song Devil Bird, Cooper set about making a record that would have the best chance of making sense to an alien.</p> <p>His piece is based on a series of rhythmic clicks that gradually speed up until they make the sound of a tone, at least to human ears. “I’ve assumed the alien that discovers this is spacefaring, so they’re probably more advanced than us and their transition from individual sounds to tones maybe happens at a much higher frequency than ours,” he says. “So they won’t hear these nice tones like we do – what they’ll hear is the relationship in terms of the rhythms of the clicks. I wanted to break music down to the simplest source of sound that an alien might be able to understand.”</p> <p>Cooper has a science background – he holds a PhD in computational biology and previously worked as a geneticist – which he puts to good use when I ask questions such as: what if aliens haven’t evolved hearing in the same way we have? “There’s a thing called convergent evolution,” he says. “On Earth, the eye has evolved multiple times independently. It’s the same with other senses like hearing. That gives us reason to believe that aliens would have similar senses. It’s not watertight but you can definitely make that argument.”</p> <p>Cooper’s track is embellished with huge 1980s synth chords that give it a brilliantly retro sci-fi feel, a concession to the fact that it’s currently only going to be heard by humans. “Originally, the plan was for it to be made only with sounds made by the body, but the chords that came from just the body were pretty nasty,” he says. “I love conceptual music but I wanted to make something that was nice to listen to as well.”</p> <p>Trying to empathise with the sensory evolution of an alien race is an act of optimism that chimes with the original spirit of the Golden Record. But other contributions to Earth Rising strike a bleaker note: dehumanisation, fascism and grief are all picked over by the various artists. Porsha Olayiwola’s scathing In Alignment With the Women Before Me documents the horrors that have taken place on American soil in recent years, namechecking Amber Thurman, the 28-year-old medical assistant who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/harris-trump-georgia-abortion-death-amber-nicole-thurman\">died of septic shock in Georgia</a> after a medical abortion. It also references Aaron Bushnell, the 25-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/25/man-set-himself-on-fire-israel-embassy\">serviceman who set himself alight</a> outside the Israeli embassy in Washington DC.</p>    <p>“I struggle with my role as a poet/writer/artist/witness,” says Olayiwola. “Part of me always wants to do more than write – I want to organise and protest and mobilise. I ask, ‘What can I do with my pencil? What can I do with my voice?’ I thought, if anything, we must begin to speak about these things. Acknowledge and witness and document these atrocities. And perhaps we will begin to intervene.”</p> <p>I wonder if the despair of today is a little jarring considering the hope and optimism of the original project, but Zulfiqar disagrees. “Even when somebody is saying something quite bleak,” she says, “it reflects that they believe things could be better.”</p> <p>Olayiwola agrees: “We only leave the bleakness behind if we elect to look it directly in the eye, and shape our future accordingly. My poem serves as a reflection of the abyss. May it be as dark as the night sky in which we may see a glimmer of a star.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://earth-rising.com/\">Earth Rising: Messages from the Pale Blue Dot</a> is out now</p>",

            "body" : "<p>There was a time when having two Batmen in your cinematic universe would have felt like a clerical error. But in James Gunn’s brave and bold new DCU, having several Bruce Waynes is increasingly looking less like an irritating glitch and more like a deliberate choice.</p> <p>Gunn has been clear for some time that he sees no issue with two Caped Crusaders striding into multiplexes at the same time. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is down to the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/28/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson\">Matt Reeves’s The Batman</a> – an insular, noirish, Kurt Cobain-obsessed but relatively real-world take on the Dark Knight – proved pretty popular with audiences just prior to Gunn being handed the keys to the DC kingdom. But who am I to quibble? Sure, this might be a universe destined to feature cavalcades of superheroes who exist in a magical world of shimmering cosplay, but if we can just convince the geek in the street that the Robert Pattinson version of Batman is living in a completely different, gritty David Fincher-esque rat-infested underbelly of Gotham, all will be reasonably well.</p> <p>We may eventually find ourselves living in a world in which cinematic universes are so desperate to stay flexible (and profitable) that they accommodate multiple versions of the same hero at once, without telling audiences why or how they’re different; dooming them to a future of confusion, apathy and narrative fatigue.</p> <p>The current suggestion is that the Gunn-produced Batman movie The Brave and the Bold, set within the DCU, will most likely hit cinemas in 2028, while Reeves’s sequel to The Batman will exist as a DC Elseworlds story in a completely separate creative space called the “Batman Epic Crime Saga”. Two Dark Knights, two universes, one comic-book brand. We all know it’s just smoke, mirrors and strategically deployed multiversal chaos – but the very thought that we might get two decent Caped Crusaders after decades in which it was pretty hard to grab hold of one at a time might just be enough to have the vast majority of us hyperventilating into our cowls with glee.<em> If </em>DC gets it right.</p>    <p>Gunn has been out and about (mostly online) this week as we ramp up to the release of Superman in cinemas, and the most interesting thing he’s had to say is that there’s no reason Batman villains can’t appear in <em>both</em> versions of the Dark Knight’s story. “There’s no diehard rule,” <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@jamesgunn/post/DLApSICAXaU?xmt=AQF0AWxRwU517eK4rjbUplKD8Bn-uhTfORt1hQxWxlXRSA\">Gunn said on Threads</a>, in response to a fan. He also added: “But both the Crime Saga and DCU are a part of DC Studios, so we of course take everything into account.”</p> <p>This doesn’t mean Barry Keoghan’s Joker will appear in both The Batman Part II and The Brave and the Bold, but it does suggest that the firewall between Elseworlds and the mainline DCU is not exactly steel-reinforced. If Reeves’s rogues’ gallery proves too popular, don’t be surprised if they start quietly migrating into Gunn’s continuity like confused tourists who’ve wandered into the wrong Batcave.</p> <p>And then there are Gunn’s comments <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/superman-director-james-gunn-dc-studios-interview-1235356450/\">in an interview with Rolling Stone</a> that he’s not hoping to make The Brave and the Bold’s Dark Knight into a “funny, campy Batman” because this simply doesn’t interest him. It’s a line that might make us collapse into a nostalgia coma for the days when George Clooney’s nipples were at least trying something different. So just how does Gunn make this new Caped Crusader stand out? Perhaps this is why reports suggest that the new DCU big cheese has refused to sign off on a script for The Brave and the Bold until it’s absolutely perfect. In fact, this is supposedly the Guardians of the Galaxy director’s new mantra for the DCU: that <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/james-gunn-movie-industry-dying-unfinished-scripts-1236292636/\">most of Hollywood’s superhero-based failures over the past few decades have been down to poor scripts that were never properly finished</a> – and that he’s determined not to repeat these mistakes.</p> <p>Insisting on a perfect screenplay is an undeniably noble ambition, especially in a genre where entire billion-dollar franchises have been stitched together from studio notes, deleted scenes and vibes. And yet if Gunn really does believe that two Batmen can coexist peacefully in the same cultural sphere without making audiences feel as if they’ve accidentally watched the same film twice, it’s possible he’s never seen The Illusionist or The Prestige, and had to spend time trying to explain to a confused family member which one actually had Paul Giamatti in it.</p>",

I had my whole family here, from both sides. It’s magic.\" , 3:B - Griezmann’s first three kids were born on 8 April – Mia in 2016, Alba in 2021 and Amaro in 2019. His fourth, Shai, was born on 15 June. , 4:B - “I was pretty good and, to be honest, I think I could have made a career out of it,” he says. “But rugby is so much more fun than shot put.” , 5:A - Luke Littler and Luke Humphries were expected to win the cup for England, but Josh Rock and Daryl Gurney led Northern Ireland to glory., 6:C - “I was just a passenger,” said the winning jockey William Buick. “I didn’t have to touch the brakes once. It’s an extreme distance, two and a half miles, so you need an extraordinary horse with an extraordinary set of skills. He’s got that lung capacity and stamina. He got in a great rhythm, but he’s so genuine.”, 7:D - That’s why the week's racing begins with the Queen Anne Stakes. , 8:A - Robert Kubica, the former F1 driver, crossed the chequered flag for Ferrari., 9:B - Bayern beat Auckland City, a team of part-timers who are not even the best club in Auckland, let alone New Zealand. Their goalkeeper Conor Tracey had to take unpaid leave from his job in a hardware store to attend the tournament. “I’ve always had to combine annual leave with unpaid days,” said Tracey. “I’m going to struggle a bit with rent and bills, but playing against Bayern, Benfica and Boca is 100% worth it.”, 10:A - Gattuso scored his only goal for Italy in a 1-0 win against England in November 2000. , 11:C - Referees are now penalising goalkeepers who hold on to the ball for more than eight seconds. , 12:A - They beat the Edmonton Oilers (having also beaten them in the finals last year)., 13:B - The 131-year-old cup, which is made of silver and a nickel alloy, is relatively malleable. It’s likely to be fixed in time for their trophy parade on Sunday. , 14:B - “We’ve used the mountain as a theme and an image throughout this campaign,” said Wilkinson. “Qualifying was always going to be an uphill battle with little setbacks. As we’ve moved towards the Euros we’ve talked about the summit, the Everest part of it; that something is impossible until it isn’t.”, 15:B - The Juventus players called into the White House to see Trump after one of their matches at the Club World Cup. Weah says they were not given a choice and “had to go”. </p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"16\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Ah well.

            "body" : "<p>Two decades ago, as Americans debated whether their country should invade Iraq, one question loomed the largest: did Saddam Hussein possess weapons of mass destruction? If so, the implication was that the United States should disarm and overthrow his regime by military force. If not, Washington could keep that option in reserve and continue to contain Saddam through economic sanctions and routine bombings.</p> <p>In time, the implications of the Iraq war far exceeded the boundaries of the original debate. Saddam, it turned out, had no weapons of mass destruction. But suppose he had possessed the chemical and biological agents that the war’s advocates claimed. Invading his country to destroy his regime would have given him the greatest possible incentive to use the worst weapons at his disposal. The war would have been just as mistaken – more so, in fact.</p> <p>For the same reason, the matter of WMD hardly explains the war’s genesis or its ultimate consequences. The advocates of invasion, it is true, didn’t want Saddam to build his supposed arsenal and potentially go nuclear. More important, however, they <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/iraq-and-pathologies-primacy\">saw an opportunity</a> to assert America’s dominance on the global stage after the country was struck on 9/11. They wanted to remake the Middle East and demonstrate American power. That they did, just not as they hoped.</p> <p>Today the United States government, under President Donald Trump, is again weighing whether to use military force against a Middle Eastern country that was not preparing to attack the United States. This time the decisive question is supposed to be whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon and reaching some ill-defined point of no return. If you answer yes, you therefore favor US strikes on Iranian enrichment facilities and possibly much else. After all, the United States has long maintained that Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, and if that goal cannot be achieved by diplomacy – even if America’s ally Israel may have spoiled that diplomacy – it must be attempted by force.</p> <p>The American public should resist such thinking, which does not make sense. Iran, according to US intelligence, was not on the verge of producing a useable nuclear device. It was giving itself that option, producing highly enriched uranium, but had not yet decided to obtain a weapon, much less undertaken the additional steps needed to construct one. For the past two months, Iran had been in diplomatic negotiations with the Trump administration, and both sides appeared to be getting closer to a deal that would drastically curtail Tehran’s enrichment of uranium and prevent any path to the bomb.</p> <p>Then Israel attacked. It acted less to pre-empt an Iranian bomb than to preempt American diplomacy. A new nuclear deal would have lifted sanctions on Iran’s battered economy, helping it to recover and grow. A deal would have stabilized Iran’s position in the Middle East and potentially strengthened it over time. Precisely by succeeding in preventing Iran from going nuclear, a deal would have advanced Iran’s integration into the region, accelerating the wary rapprochement Tehran had achieved with its historic rival, Saudi Arabia, over the past two years.</p> <p>The specific deal under discussion, which envisaged bringing Iran into a regional consortium to enrich uranium, would have kick-started the process. From there, who knows: perhaps the United States might normalize relations with Iran and, having rid itself of its main regional enemy, finally act on the desire of successive bipartisan presidents, Trump included, to pull back from the Middle East.</p> <p>This was the outcome that would have best served the interests of the United States. This was the outcome Israel acted to prevent. To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a formidable, normalized, and non-nuclear Iran was the threat that mattered most. Attacking Iran, by contrast, presented an opportunity – to cripple and perhaps even overthrow the Islamic Republic, whose best air defenses Israel had disabled the previous year, after Iran’s strongest regional allies in Lebanon and Syria crumbled in spectacular fashion. Israel does not know, because no one can, what kind of Iran will emerge from the wreckage: whether it will be more aggrieved or less, nuclear armed or not, a functioning state or a cauldron of chaos. Netanyahu took a gamble nonetheless, figuring the United States would finish his job, clean up his mess, or both.</p> <p>Even if Iran were speeding toward a nuclear weapon, even if diplomacy had been exhausted, the threat of a nuclear Iran should not be inflated. Suppose for a moment that Iran went nuclear, which it may well do now that the absence of such a deterrent left it vulnerable to attack. If Iran got the bomb, the United States, a nuclear-armed country, would remain fundamentally secure. Israel, a nuclear-armed country, would remain fundamentally secure. Iran would go nuclear to ensure the survival of its regime. Firing nuclear weapons at Israel would assure Iran’s destruction. Iran is unlikely to do that.</p> <p>Make no mistake: for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons is entirely undesirable. It could trigger the further spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and beyond. Iran could resume its destabilizing and destructive activities, targeting US interests and allies, assured that no one would dare to strike at the regime. The United States has rightly invested considerable effort, over decades, to prevent an Iranian bomb. But is that objective worth war? <em>Our</em> war? <em>This</em> war?</p> <p>If the United States joins Israel’s fight to try to finish Israel’s job, it will enter into a war of unknowable scope against a country of 90 million people in a region of marginal strategic significance. Iran may well retaliate against Americans, triggering a large-scale, open-ended conflict. In the absolute best-case scenario, the war would quickly end in an Iranian capitulation so complete that Israel would be content to stop shooting. What then?</p> <p>Iranians won’t forget being attacked. Israelis won’t trust the country they attacked but left intact. And Americans will see that no matter whom they elect – even on the slogan of “America first” – their leaders refuse to take control of events and act on the national imperative to leave Middle East wars behind and focus instead on the great many unsolved and worsening problems that will actually decide America’s fate.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, the United States steps back from the brink, it will open up new possibilities. Of valuing the well-being of Americans over the hatred of distant demons. Of no longer living in permanent, insatiable fear. Of getting out of the position from which a rogue ally can obstruct America’s efforts, determine its national agenda, and damage its civic life.</p> <p>Those are the possibilities worth fighting for.</p> <ul> <li><p>Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>The threat of a world war. Political assassinations. Federal raids on unsuspecting migrants.</p> <p>There seems to be no end to terrifying news these days. In fact, it comes at us so unceasingly that numbness can set in. Or even depression or melancholy, like a black cloud over every part of our lives.</p> <p>The “gloomcycle” is what Rachel Janfaza, who founded the gen Z-oriented site known as the Up and Up, has dubbed what’s going on. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.theupandup.us/p/welcome-to-the-gloomcycle?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">piece,</a> she quoted one 23-year-old from Alabama: “I am really overwhelmed by all of the bad news I am seeing right now.”</p> <p>Whatever generation we’re from, that’s a familiar sensation.</p> <p>The question is, how to deal with it? After all, particularly because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s chaotic ways, it shows no signs of slowing down. And while it’s important not to tune out altogether, it’s also important to stay grounded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/18/iran-us-nuclear-negotiaons-israel-war\">America is sleepwalking into another unnecessary war | Eli Clifton and Eldar Mamedov</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where’s the balance?</p> <p>I’m certainly not a life coach but as someone whose work requires me to stay connected and informed, I’ve developed some coping resources.</p> <p>Here are three recommendations to manage the firehose of bad news and to protect your spiritual and emotional health while still staying engaged in the world.</p> <p><strong>Set thoughtful limits</strong>. Can you put your phone in another room or in a drawer for a period of each day? Can you pledge never to sleep with it nearby? I have a friend who has made a pact with her spouse to have an hour after waking and an hour before going to bed in which they don’t talk about current events, and certainly never utter the name of the 47th president.</p> <p>Can you decide not to be on social media during significant hours of the day? And maybe even to ignore your email unless it’s during loosely defined business hours? (This is an especially tough one for me; I always want to respond immediately, which only elicits another response.)</p> <p><strong>Engage in self-care. </strong>Maybe you go to the gym or for a run. Maybe it’s a bubble bath. Maybe it’s listening, without any other distractions, to Mozart – or Jon Batiste. For me, it’s daily yoga (the challenging ashtanga practice) followed by meditation. And it’s reading fiction or memoirs unrelated to politics – most recently, Cormac McCarthy’s All the Pretty Horses, Fredrik Backman’s My Friends, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/19/how-to-lose-your-mother-erica-jong-molly-jong-fast\">Molly Jong-Fast’s How to Lose Your Mother</a>, and, in galley form, Susan Orlean’s not-yet-published memoir, Joyride.</p> <p>A friend told me recently that she’s rereading all six novels of Jane Austen as an antidote to these fractious times. I like to read books in print, not on a device, since screens are already too dominant in my life. Can you slow down enough to give your full attention to literature for an hour? It will help, and it will also help to build back your undoubtedly frayed attention span.</p> <p><strong>Rely on trusted voices and sources of news. </strong>I think the Guardian is one of these, and I would think so even if I didn’t write here almost every week. I know a lot of people who count on the perspective of Heather Cox Richardson, the history professor who writes a daily <a href=\"https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/\">newsletter</a>, Letters from an American. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-reich\">Robert Reich</a>, a former labor secretary, is one of my go-to sources of perspective, as are a few columnists, including Will Bunch at the Philadelphia Inquirer and Lydia Polgreen at the New York Times.</p> <p>While traveling in Asia recently, I read the Japan Times and the international edition of the New York Times each morning; they were bundled together and delivered to my hotel room. There was something about that well-organized news – delivered in old-fashioned print form – that was incredibly calming. A prominently displayed column about Israel by Thomas Friedman gave me more context than a freaked-out social media thread, no matter how smart. While it’s unlikely that we’re going to return to reading a print newspaper as a major news source, the daily pacing and the sensible curation of what’s important has a lot to recommend it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/19/anti-trump-no-kings-slogan-protest-march\">The anti-Trump camp was in disarray.

Hayes confessed in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/397131/the-gray-area-chris-hayes-attention-economy\">Vox interview</a> that despite his knowledge about the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/02/smartphones-attention-economy-reclaim-free-time\">attention economy</a>” and its personal costs, he still struggles.</p> <p>“I’ve written a recovery memoir,” Hayes joked that he told his wife, “and I’m still drinking.”</p> <p>The bad news will keep coming. As citizens, we need to know what’s happening so we can act – in the voting booth, at a protest rally, in conversations with our neighbors or loved ones.</p> <p>But that doesn’t mean constant immersion.

            "body" : "<p>He is risen. He is risen indeed. Six years after he huffed off to New Zealand in a hail of tuts, tsks and never-liked-you-anyways, Noel Edmonds has returned to our screens with a message for humanity. “We’re not trees,” he proclaims. “We can move.” Noel Edmonds – and there can be no doubt that this is very much Noel Edmonds – is referring to his decision to leave the UK with his wife (Liz, 55) in order to establish an 800-acre hospitality business in the sobbingly beautiful South Island idyll of Ngatimoti. He doesn’t like Britain any more, he says. It has “changed”.</p> <p>But Noel – as his new programme, Kiwi Adventure, makes blisteringly clear – has not changed. He looks like a child’s sand drawing of Aslan. He believes in “the universal energy system”, wears combatively tight linen T-shirts and has baths so cold he fears openly for the future of his scrotum. He is a deeply odd man. <em>And yet.</em> From the depths of the oddness re-emerges an imperishable truth: Noel Edmonds, for better or worse, is clinically incapable of making uninteresting TV.</p> <p>Here, then, are seven of the most notable emissions from the man’s party cannon.</p> <h2><strong>Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (</strong><strong>1976-</strong><strong>82)</strong></h2>    <p>“<em>Swap Shopppp</em>,” bugled the theme tune, heralding the all-too-brief golden age of Saturday morning TV, an inflatable neon wonderland in which a jubilantly youthful Noel Edmonds could ask Kate Bush how she got her hair to go like that.</p> <h2><strong>Telly Addicts (</strong><strong>1985-</strong><strong>98)</strong></h2> <p>Ferociously watchable studio quiz in which square-eyed families went cardigan-to-cardigan over questions about Blue Peter and Keith Chegwin. The winner? Knitwear. The runner-up? Telly. Noel’s stewardship – aggressively serviceable action-slacks, smirk like the judgment of Zeus – would lend much-needed tension to the soft furnishings, thus plunging the McPerms of Perth and the Vauxhall-Cavaliers of Nantwich into a perpetual Scooby Doo-based deathmatch. Bring it back!</p> <h2><strong>Noel’s House Party (</strong><strong>1991-</strong><strong>99)</strong></h2>    <p>Welcome ye to “Crinkley Bottom,” an illusory fiefdom in which unsuspecting celebrity visitors (Dave Lee Travis, Edwina Currie etc) were greeted with mockery, gunge and often startlingly physical “gotchas”. Pivotal to the chaos were Noel (presentational style: giggling necromancer) and bubonic familiar Mr Blobby, whose monosyllabic distress and sudden bouts of confused violence would attract audiences of 15 million. The House Party manifesto was as simple as the era in which it was conceived: hysterical conviviality for all, unless you’re Dave Lee Travis, in which case we’ll break your legs.</p>    <h2><strong>Noel’s Christmas Presents (</strong><strong>1989-</strong><strong>99; </strong><strong>2007-</strong><strong>11)</strong></h2> <p><em>Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël / Born is the King of Bra-aa-aaacknell</em>. And Hove. And Ipswich, Canada, Finland and Crewe. The premise whispered of doom and seasonal biliousness but in reality the annual sight of Edmonds guffawing around the world to deliver festive reunions and white goods to the sickly and deserving was … not great, precisely, but also, crucially, <em>not cack</em>. The reason? Our host’s unique ability to sidestep mawkishness while dressed as, variously, Santa, a Victorian dignitary and a garden gnome. He’s called Noel for a reason, you know.</p> <h2><strong>Deal or No Deal? (</strong><strong>2005-</strong><strong>16)</strong></h2> <p>The concept? Simple. The Noel? Guarded; tightly bearded; visibly uncomfortable around pensioners. The subsequent, sweltering tension – will Doris from Thanet attempt to engage him in a conversation about her dead husband for longer than her allotted 30 seconds? – would turn a daytime gameshow about cardboard boxes into a potentially lethal game of chance.</p>    <h2><strong>Noel’s HQ (</strong><strong>2008-09)</strong></h2> <p>Emboldened by the success of Deal or No Deal?, Edmonds’ (brief) return to Saturday night TV found our subject very much in “Noel’s narked off” mode, sprinting through the obligatory “members of the public rewarded for charitable deeds” bits in order to address the vexed issue of “Broken Britain”. And lo, Noel didst upbraid bungling councils, bellow about bylaws and deliver sudden, snarling exhortations to<em> know thy consumer rights</em> lest the heavens split asunder and ye be cast into the eternal fire of implied warranty (Hotpoint 3:11-13). The subtext? I (Noel Edmonds) am angry, thus you (the viewer/Broken Britain/God) must pay. It was, in a very real sense, Brexit’s patient zero.</p> <h2><strong>Noel Edmonds’</strong><strong> Kiwi Adventure (</strong><strong>2025)</strong></h2>    <p>“I am rocking,” intones Noel, emerging from his hyperbaric chamber like a blow-dried Christ. “I. AM. ROCKING.” Broadcast this sort of stuff from a regional news studio and viewers would be lunging for the nearest mallet. But here, buttressed by a gasp-inducing mountain range and a preternaturally tolerant wife, Edmonds takes on an air of … vulnerability? <em>Lik</em><em>ability?</em> Besides, the man’s 76. If he wants to say “I am Jesus” while wearing utility shorts in an outdoor shower, who are we to object? After six decades of televisual brilliance, awfulness, jumpers, Alan Partridge-esque hubris and comb-through hair colour, Noel Edmonds, perhaps more than anyone, has earned the right to be Noel Edmonds. Let us give thanks.</p> <p>• Noel Edmonds’ Kiwi Adventure is on ITV1 at 9pm.</p>",

The shark is working!’” In an admission that is a testament to the movie’s power, Dreyfuss says he has never been back into the sea since.</p> <h2><strong>Sign up</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the US morning briefing\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"A different kind of daily email\" data-form-description=\"Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

            "body" : "<p>As the British folk revival expanded and developed through the 1960s and 70s, many of the leading performers were photographed by Brian Shuel, who has died aged 90. His early photographs were often taken indoors, in darkened folk clubs held in upstairs rooms in pubs, which required him to push the film to its limits, resulting in grainy but atmospheric images. He combined his artist’s eye with often being in the right place at the right time. In December 1962, Brian was at the King &amp; Queen folk club in central London to photograph <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/21/martin-carthy-bob-dylan-paul-simon-scarborough-fair-new-album\">Martin Carthy</a>, but he also captured one of the floor singers – Bob Dylan on his first visit to Britain.</p> <p>Three days later, he photographed him again at the Singers’ Club, with the folk revival founding fathers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared\">Ewan MacColl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/aug/19/al-lloyd-an-evening-with-cd-review\">AL Lloyd</a> in the audience.</p> <p>In those early years, Brian photographed folk performers such as the Watersons, Fairport Convention, Shirley Collins and Pentangle, as well as visiting Americans including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/28/pete-seeger\">Pete Seeger</a> and the Rev Gary Davis. In 1963, at the Edinburgh festival, he photographed the Dubliners when they were still known as the Ronnie Drew Ballad Group. He photographed performers both on and off stage, including those at the first Keele folk festivals in 1965 and 1966.</p>    <p>Brian was born in Dublin, to Beatrice (nee Oulton) and Ronald Shuel, who served in the colonial police in Nigeria. Brian was brought up by his mother’s two unmarried sisters in County Wicklow. He was educated at the Royal School Armagh in Northern Ireland, and then, from 1954, at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. After completing his graphic design course, he did national service as a cartographer in Singapore; it was there that he bought his first camera.</p> <p>On his return in 1958, Brian married Sally Boswell, whom he had met on his first day at college. His father-in-law, the illustrator and artist James Boswell, was editor of Sainsbury’s in-house magazine and Brian became its designer, soon also photographing many aspects of Sainsbury’s operations. </p> <p>Through his leftwing activism, James Boswell became a director of Topic Records, Britain’s pre-eminent folk record label, which had its origins in the Workers’ Music Association. Boswell had illustrated many of their early record sleeves and in 1962, to learn more about the music, he and Brian embarked on a nationwide tour of folk clubs, travelling as far as Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Newcastle and the Spinners’ club in Liverpool.</p>    <p>Brian’s photographs featured on Topic record sleeves and the quality of his work spread his reputation among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/15/british-folk-music-scene-1963\">still-developing folk scene</a>. He told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/sep/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Nathan Joseph</a> of Transatlantic Records that he did not think much of their sleeve designs and was challenged to prove he could do better. A hundred or so sleeves followed, including the early records of Ralph McTell, Billy Connolly (with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/04/gerry-rafferty-obituary\">Gerry Rafferty</a> as the Humblebums) and Mike and Sally Oldfield as the Sallyangie. Many of the sleeves featured Brian’s photographs; he also designed the label’s logo, as well as sleeves for American reissues on Transatlantic’s Xtra label.</p> <p>Brian’s photographs brought him into contact with the English Folk Dance and Song Society, whose librarian, Ruth Noyes, encouraged him to photograph the Bampton Morris Dancers from west Oxfordshire on their traditional Whit Monday tour. The visual attraction of such seasonal customs was obvious, and Brian set about a nationwide pilgrimage to photograph them: the Abbots Bromley Horn Dancers, Padstow’s Obby Oss, Ashbourne Shrovetide football – more than 200 in total. In 1972, he was the adviser for a BBC film by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/29/barrie-gavin-obituary\">Barrie Gavin</a>, The Passing of the Year.</p> <p>In the 80s, Brian revisited many of the customs for a book, The National Trust Guide to Traditional Customs of Britain, which was published to critical acclaim by Webb and Bower in 1985. He also wrote descriptions of the customs: unlike many similar books, Brian had actually visited all the events featured. His approach was to capture the fun, sheer enjoyment and pride of the participants, whose confidence he quickly gained.</p>    <p>The full extent of Brian’s archive of folk musicians and customs was revealed only when he digitised hundreds of images and uploaded them onto his <a href=\"http://www.collectionspicturelibrary.co.uk/\">Collections Picture Library</a> and personal websites. His photographs continue to be admired and eagerly sought after.</p> <p>Brian’s assessment that his pictures were “simple, straightforward, honest and well designed” was typically modest.</p> <p>Although best known for his folk music and customs photographs, Brian also built considerable portfolios of images of bridges and London. His freelance photography work for Sainsbury’s continued, and other commissions came from, among others, British Steel, Daily Mirror, the prison system (he photographed in more than 40 prisons), Kodak and the Central Office of Information. From 1985, Brian edited the journal of the British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies (Bapla). His wife Sal was Bapla’s administrator, as well as a freelance illustrator.</p> <p>Brian is survived by Sal, their two sons, Simon and Ben, and grandson, James.</p> <p> • Brian Courtenay Oulton Shuel, photographer and designer, born 4 March 1935; died 12 June 2025</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Teachers in Hong Kong have been warned to keep themselves and students away from any US Independence Day celebrations as they may breach national security laws, educators have alleged.</p> <p>A text message purportedly sent by the principal of a Hong Kong school to staff said the education bureau’s regional education office had reminded them “to be careful about Independence Day activities organised by the US consulate in Hong Kong, and not to participate to avoid violating the national security law and Hong Kong laws”.</p> <p>The text was published on Edu Lancet, a Facebook page run by a former manager at the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, Hans Yeung. It urged staff to be diligent in “protecting” any students who were considering participating, and to discourage them.</p> <p>Another email shared on Edu Lancet, and seen independently by the Guardian, told faculty staff that any teacher who received an invitation from an embassy or a foreign organisation funded by an embassy must seek permission to attend from the principal for the purpose of “maintaining national security”.</p> <p>The Hong Kong education bureau did not confirm or deny the claims in response to questions from the Guardian, but in a statement said it had enacted policies to help schools “effectively prevent and suppress acts and activities that endanger or are detrimental to national security.</p> <p>“Schools have the responsibility to play a good gatekeeper role and to enhance the sensitivity of teachers and students to national security.”</p> <p>The bureau had enacted “clear guidelines” for schools that required them to “establish school-based mechanisms and formulate appropriate measures, according to their own circumstances and needs, to implement various tasks related to safeguarding national security and national security education”, it added.</p> <p>The bureau did not answer questions about what laws would be broken by attending any Fourth of July event, or whether such warnings only applied to the US holiday.</p> <p>The US Consulate in Hong Kong has been contacted for comment.</p> <p>Edu Lancet and Yeung, who runs the page to voice concerns from those working with the education system and “expose the current problems”, have been criticised by the Hong Kong government in the past for their posts. The security secretary, Chris Tang, has accused Yeung of “making incitements” from his current home in the UK.</p> <p>The purported directives fit in with tightening restrictions on Hong Kong’s education system, and a push to have the curriculum focus more on national security amid increased control of the city by the Chinese government. After pro-democracy protests rocked the city in 2019, the ruling Chinese Communist party imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that broadly outlawed acts of dissent and opposition as violations against the state.</p> <p>In 2020, the then chief executive, Carrie Lam, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/carrie-lam-blames-hong-kong-education-system-for-fuelling-protests\">blamed the education system</a> for fuelling the protests, setting the tone for an overhaul that is ongoing.</p> <p>The Hong Kong government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/hong-kong-schools-in-crisis-as-teachers-and-students-flee-toxic-political-climate\">has since altered</a> the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/05/lets-learn-about-national-security-hong-kong-releases-video-for-young-children\">school curriculum</a> to include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/hong-kong-national-security-children-new-laws\">teachings on national security</a> in subjects such as <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3313909/english-lessons-hong-kong-primary-schools-cover-national-security\">English language</a>, music, maths and sport, and to focus more on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/24/hong-kong-to-restructure-primary-education-to-make-it-more-patriotic\">patriotic education</a>. It has also banned texts it sees as endangering national security, including a picture book about sheep created by the city’s physiotherapists union, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/hong-kong-authors-of-childrens-books-sheep-wolves-convicted-of-sedition\">and prosecuted authors</a>.</p> <p>Teachers in Hong Kong have previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/09/hong-kong-schools-in-crisis-as-teachers-and-students-flee-toxic-political-climate\">told the Guardian</a> they felt pressure to self-censor for fear of being reported for remarks seen as unpatriotic. Since the start of the 2023-24 school year, all new teachers in public sector schools, direct subsidy scheme schools and kindergartens must sit an exam on Hong Kong’s mini constitution, the Basic Law, and the national security law.</p> <p>Hong Kong’s education minister, Christine Choi, has <a href=\"https://www.thestandard.com.hk/hong-kong-news/article/304850/Education-chief-warns-of-soft-resistance-in-schools\">repeatedly warned of “soft resistance” in schools</a>, and this month said educators had to be vigilant against the infiltration of “hostile forces” through events such as book fairs and extracurricular activities which “could include undesirable reading materials”.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu</em></p>",

It was the movie that in effect invented the summer blockbuster, paving the way for Star Wars, Jurassic Park and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It cast sharks in the role of monsters to be feared and killed – but also stimulated interest in marine conservation.</p> <p>Based on a novel by Peter Benchley and directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/stevenspielberg\">Steven Spielberg</a>, Jaws tells the story of a great white shark terrorising the beach town of Amity Island, prompting police chief Martin Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper and grizzled fisherman Quint to hunt it down. It earned rave reviews from critics and became the first movie to take more than $100m in theatrical rentals.</p> <p>The three men on a boat were Dreyfuss (Hooper), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/12/obituaries.usa\">Roy Scheider</a> (Brody) and Robert Shaw (Quint) and the dynamic between them is central to the film’s appeal. Today only Dreyfuss is left. Now, 77, sitting in a library at his home in San Diego, California, his memories remain lucid. “First of all, you have to remember this is not 50 years later,” he says via Zoom. “This is yesterday.<em>”</em></p> <p>At first Dreyfuss turned the part down. “At this lunch meeting he [Spielberg] illustrated the story very well, very vividly, and he said, did you like it? I said, oh, yes. He said, do you want to do it? I said, no, and he said, why? I said, because it’s going to be a bitch to shoot. I at that moment was not looking for difficulties. I turned him down in that meeting and then I turned him down again.”</p> <p>But then Dreyfuss saw a rough cut of a film he had just made and thought his performance looked so bad that it might end his career. So he called Spielberg and begged him for the role. Once shooting got under way, it did not go as Dreyfuss had prophesied at that lunch meeting.</p> <p>“One of the many things that I learned was that it was not a bitch to shoot at all. I would say that there was one word that characterised the shoot and that was waiting. More waiting than anything.”</p> <p>Despite the difficulty and cost, Spielberg insisted on shooting in the open ocean off Martha’s Vineyard for the sake of authenticity. The budget ballooned from $4m to $9m. Production went 100 days over schedule and was plagued by the malfunctions of the mechanical shark (nicknamed “Bruce” after Spielberg’s lawyer).</p> <p>At the mention of this, Dreyfuss puts his hands to his mouth to mimic a loudspeaker: “‘The shark is not working. The shark is not working. Repeat. The shark is not working.’ And then one day you hear this. ‘The shark is working! The shark is working!’”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9zBnXI8Q0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oJ9zBnXI8Q0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>He recalls: “There were three different sharks and three different crews that worked the shark and it was all a disaster. There’s a line in the film where Robert says he had these eyes, these doll’s eyes, and he did because they <em>were</em> doll’s eyes!</p> <p>“Steven had to conceive of a film which implied the shark rather than show it directly. That was the story of the shoot: the director, Steven, had to rework his conception of the entire movie because he knew he could not show it as brazenly or blatantly as he had assumed. That ultimately made the film a masterpiece.”</p> <p>Spielberg, who was in his mid-20s at the time, has credited director Alfred Hitchcock with influencing his less-is-more approach to building suspense. He also received a mighty lift from composer John Williams, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BePfzCOMRZQ\">two-note theme music</a> initially seemed so simple that Spielberg thought it a joke until he realised its visceral menace.</p> <p>Dreyfuss comments:<em> </em>“John is an extraordinary composer and it took him no time at all to create a sound picture that could carry the film. You don’t see the shark first: you hear it. Under the credits you hear bar-dum, bar-dum, bar-dum, bar-dum and you’re seeing that shark moving through the underbrush and I’m telling you, it put the fear of God in the audience and me and everybody.”</p> <p>The British film critic Mark Kermode <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/31/jaws-40-years-on-truly-great-lasting-classics-of-america-cinema\">has argued</a> that Jaws is not about a shark. A case in point is a scene below deck in which Quint recalls how sharks ravaged survivors after the wartime sinking of the USS Indianapolis, providing Quint with a powerful motivation for his hatred of the animals. Enhanced by improvisation captured on tape recorders, it has been described by Spielberg as “the scene that I’m proudest of in Jaws”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/18/steven-spielberg-tells-of-guilt-jaws-film-sharks\">Spielberg tells of guilt over harm hit film Jaws may have done to sharks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shaw – who struggled with alcoholism for most of his life – made himself drunk for the scene but it backfired on the first take, Dreyfuss recalls. “He lost control of himself and he was terribly embarrassed and that only made him drink more and so that day was a terrible humiliation for him. Because I was sitting next to him and in the shot, it was painful.</p> <p>“That night he called Steven at two or three in the morning and said, how badly did I humiliate myself? Steven said, not fatally. He came in the next morning and he did the scene in one take and he was brilliant.”</p> <p>For decades there have been stories that the palpable tension between Hooper and Quint was not based on acting alone but mirrored personal animosity between Dreyfuss and Shaw. The alleged feud was explored in the recent play <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/10/jaws-play-the-shark-is-broken-broke-richard-dreyfusss-heart\">The Shark is Broken</a> co-written by and starring Shaw’s son Ian. Dreyfuss, however, is adamant this is a myth and one that pains him to this day.</p> <p>“If you are aware of the stories in and around the filming, you know the ‘discovery’ of the feud between Robert and myself didn’t exist for 25 years,” he says firmly. “It was not the truth. It was not the fact of our relationship at all. Twenty-five years after the film was over, I found that there was this ‘feud’ between us.</p>    <p>“What there had been was one day where I was angry at him for stuff. It was one day. To a great extent what happened was that in order to jack up the stories about the film, they re-emphasized the story of this feud, which wasn’t real and the people who did it knew it. I resented that for a long time but Robert was already dead by 15 years and there was nothing I could do.</p> <p>“I cherished his memory and what I was learning from him and I’m not kidding about that. Robert was an extraordinary actor and an extraordinary writer and I could tell you a great number of stories about all of that. But I won’t allow anyone to walk away from an interview with Richard Dreyfuss and think that there was reality to the feud.”</p> <p>He and Shaw had even made plans for a future collaboration, Dreyfuss adds. “We were in the hold of the boat and we were both napping and all of a sudden Robert said, ‘I know. I’ll play the Ghost to your Hamlet if you play the Fool to my Lear.’ I said, ‘You’ve got it. But not for 10 years.’ He said, ‘Why?’ I said, ‘Because you’ll eat me alive,’ and he laughed and said, ‘OK.’</p> <p>“So we had an agreement to make those two pieces and unfortunately he died very quickly. That was a catastrophic feeling, a loss that I knew had changed my future. I could have taken willing advantage of that friendship and I was unable to.”</p> <p>When Dreyfuss first saw the finished cut of Jaws, it made a huge impression. He recalls: “I was as terrified as if I had never experienced the making of this film. I was completely swept up in the story. It was so much an achievement of film-making and my friend Steven, who’s sitting there – I knew that I was watching the crowning of the uncrowned prince of Hollywood.<em>”</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/10/people-want-blood-and-gore-what-we-got-wrong-about-filming-sharks\">‘People want blood and gore’: what we got wrong about filming sharks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The movie drew long queues at cinemas and quickly became a cultural phenomenon. “There was, for the first time, an awareness of how a film could affect all of society. There was not one group, one country, one people who were immune to this. He happened upon something that was so ubiquitous and shared by all people. Wow! Although Steven did that a number of times afterwards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/oct/13/all-steven-spielberg-films-ranked-director-the-fabelmans-et-harrison-ford\">in other films</a>, it’s easy to spot because of Jaws.”</p> <p>Dreyfuss has never again sat down to watch the whole of Jaws from start to finish, although if he chances on a TV showing that is already under way, he usually sticks with it to the end. And what of the three widely panned sequels? <em>“</em>They should never have been made and I have absolutely no interest in seeing them. Never have and never will.”</p> <p>Dreyfuss, Shaw and Spielberg were not involved in Jaws 2, released in 1978, but it did star Scheider and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdPPSD5r2bU\">Lorraine Gary</a>, playing his wife Ellen Brody as she had in the first film. Gary is now 88 and living in Los Angeles. Speaking by phone, her memories of working with Scheider on Jaws are less than rosy.</p> <p>“He was very much an isolated human at that point. He smoked; I hate cigarettes. He also spent a tremendous amount of time with one of those tin foil reflector pans, getting his tan. There was very little in common. Years later I was in New York and we ran into each other on Madison Avenue. We talked like real people at that point instead of actors on the set and it was fun – it was very professional.”</p>    <p>Typically summer months were quiet for cinemas but Jaws was deliberately timed for when people were at beach resorts and accompanied by the tagline: “See it before you go swimming!” The film opened on 464 screens in North America and was boosted by a major TV advertising campaign, still unusual at the time and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002c3l1\">marketing stunts</a> such as themed ice-creams. Gottlieb once observed: “That notion of selling a picture as an event, as a phenomenon, as a destination, was born with that release.”</p> <p>Did Gary have any sense that Jaws would be such a gamechanger? “Absolutely not. No clue. It stunned me when it did, what it did and it stuns me now. Every day I get fan mail. I’m an 88-year-old woman. Come on, leave me alone! It’s all very strange to me but luckily, it’s fun.”</p> <p>Unlike Dreyfuss, the experience did not put her off swimming. Gary has gone scuba diving and come within five feet of a shark. “I’m not scared of sharks,” she says. “The only time I was scared by sharks was when I saw my sons and my grandchildren in the ocean and I thought, sooner or later there’ll be payback, but there wasn’t. I truly do not have a very strong feeling about hurting the reputation of sharks. They deserve to be known for who they are and what they do.”</p> <p>The film’s impact on these ancient predators, which date back 450m years – longer than the dinosaurs – is complex and frequently debated. Its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1fu_sA7XhE\">official trailer</a> speaks of a “mindless eating machine” that will “attack and devour anything”, adding: “It is as if God created the devil and gave him jaws.”</p> <p>Small wonder Jaws instilled widespread fear of sharks, whose population has fallen dramatically since the early 1970s. Spielberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/18/steven-spielberg-tells-of-guilt-jaws-film-sharks\">told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs</a> in 2022: “I truly and to this day regret the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film. I really, truly regret that.”</p> <p>But the film also sparked engagement in marine science and conservation, a legacy actively pursued by the author Benchley, who died in 2006, and his wife Wendy, who is executive producer of a Nat Geo documentary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrBN9zcQAGw\">Jaws@50: The Definitive Inside Story</a>.</p> <p>In a phone interview, Wendy, 84, comments: “Jaws tapped into an innate fear of being eaten by a monster. It was a scary book and a scary movie but 90% of the people who read the book or saw the movie got over their fear; 10% never went back in the water<em>.”</em></p> <p>Benchley had worked as a speechwriter for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/08/robert-schenkkan-lyndon-b-johnson-all-the-way-bryan-cranston\">President Lyndon Johnson</a> over the last two years of his presidency then wanted to get back to freelance writing. The couple were living in Pennington, New Jersey, with two young children and financial pressures but Benchley decided to try writing a book.</p> <p>He had two ideas, Wendy says. “One was about current day pirates; one about a great white shark that hangs around a town and causes some mischief. I said, oh, honey, I don’t think either of these ideas are going to be that great. Thank heavens he didn’t listen to me.”</p> <p>Benchley had <a href=\"https://www.peterbenchley.com/about-peter-benchley\">spent childhood summers</a> sailing, fishing or swimming at Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts, where the black dorsal fins of sharks could be seen above the surface. “Now, he knew after he wrote the book, and after people started to do more and more research on sharks, that sharks do not hang around. They don’t like human flesh: we’re too bony, we don’t have enough fat on us. Peter always said, ‘I would never write Jaws again because I now know how important this animal is and how magnificent it is.’”</p> <p>Benchley was unsure what to call the book. Wendy says: “Some suggested titles were pretentious, like Leviathan Rising, and others were very scary, like White Death. Peter’s father, who was a wonderful guy and a novelist also, said with his good sense of humour: ‘How about What’s That Noshing on My Leg?’</p> <p>“It was down to the wire and Peter said, let’s settle on the word Jaws because nobody knows what it means and nobody reads a first book anyway. There was absolutely no expectation that this would be rocketing up the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/books/booksupdate/jaws-peter-benchley-50.html\">New York Times bestseller list.</a>”</p> <p>Nor did the Benchleys expect it to become a movie. Spielberg had chanced upon galley proofs of the book and been enthralled. The rights were secured by producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown for $150,000, plus $25,000 for a first draft of the script, before the novel had been published (it would sell 5.5m copies before the film opened).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/22/jaws-steven-spielberg-1975-review-derek-malcolm\">Jaws - the original Guardian review: archive, 22 Dec 1975</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wendy says: “I do remember when Peter got the phone call in our little house in Pennington. I cried. I thought, our life is ruined because I had known people who suddenly got some wealth and I thought, oh no, but we were a little bit older and we had good, strong families and we had wonderful friends and so our life stayed very solid.”</p> <p>Benchley co-wrote the screenplay, and had a bit part on screen as a reporter, but was relieved when <a href=\"https://thedailyjaws.com/blog/from-jerks-to-jaws-and-beyond-the-genius-of-screenwriter-carl-gottlieb\">Carl Gottlieb</a> took over the day-to-day writing, including a leavening of humour. The film version removed plot lines from the novel such as a mafia connection and an affair between Hooper and Brody’s wife. Spielberg also decided: you’re gonna need a bigger shark. </p>    <p>Dismayed by the demonisation of sharks, Benchley wrote, narrated and appeared in dozens of TV documentaries about marine life and became</p> <p>a full-time marine conservationist. He and his wife worked for the Environmental Defense Fund. The <a href=\"https://www.peterbenchleyoceanawards.org/\">Peter Benchley Ocean Awards</a> are held each year to celebrate individual excellence in ocean conservation.</p> <p>Wendy says: “We were horrified that people took this novel and this fictional movie as some kind of a licence to go out and kill sharks and to schedule more shark tournaments. We took this very seriously and began to work on conservation issues.”</p> <p>As awareness has grown, she adds, applications to study marine science have risen at universities around the country. “That is an outcome of Jaws that people now understand. In fact the ocean community embraces Jaws as a positive for ocean science, ocean research and conservation.</p> <p>“The other thing that surprised us and relieved us greatly was that Peter began to get thousands of letters from people all over the world who said it was a great book, scary movie, but it intrigued them and they want to know more about sharks. There were so many letters from people wanting to be Hooper, not in a white lab coat sitting doing research but out on the ocean and experiencing not only sharks but other ocean creatures. That was a wonderful feeling.”</p>",

Despite having been downgraded to category 3 by the time it made landfall over the state of Oaxaca, sustained wind speeds still reached almost 130mph, causing major disruption.

The glitziest team in basketball is changing hands at a valuation of $10bn, the biggest ever for a sports franchise. Second, it is probably an excellent deal for the buyer, even at that astonishing valuation. And third, the shift in majority ownership from the Buss family to an investment group led by Los Angeles Dodgers owner Mark Walter, is something else: inevitable.</p> <p>Sports teams are an eye-watering asset class. Not only does owning one confer countless perks and the kind of societal status that most money can’t even buy, but team valuations in the major North American sports have been on a steep upslope for decades. The sale of the Lakers represents a new peak and is also the latest data point that illustrates a new fact about sports ownership. The best properties have become too valuable an asset class for people like Jeanie Buss to control them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/18/lakers-sale-mark-walter-nba-buss-family\">Lakers to be sold to Dodgers owner at $10bn valuation, per reports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buss’ father, Jerry, bought the team in 1979, and the Lakers have since then operated like one of the world’s largest family businesses. The Lakers are by far the biggest source of the Buss family’s wealth, and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45540022/the-lakers-run-real-business-league-wide-reaction-stunning-buss-family-sale\">as ESPN reported on Thursday</a>, the team has traditionally used its own revenues to pay its expenses. Its golden goose is an enormous local television deal with the LA cable provider Spectrum.</p> <p>The cable bundle is dying, however, and these days the biggest sports teams are increasingly owned not by wealthy individuals and families but by consortiums of deep-pocketed investors and institutions. The Lakers had already moved in this direction; the Buss family sold a quarter stake in the team to a group led by Walter in 2021. That same group – with Walter as the frontman, but by no means doing it alone – took control of the Dodgers in 2012 and later bought control of the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks.</p> <p>Blue-chip sports properties like the Lakers are now too big for even most billionaires to just reach into their pocket and buy all alone. For that reason, leagues have gradually made it much easier for institutional investors to buy stakes in teams. (The NFL, with limits, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/02/cold-ravenous-and-predatory-private-equity-is-slouching-towards-the-nfl\">has swung open the door to private equity</a>.) The corollary to that trend is that when a longtime owner like Jeanie Buss has buyers lined up with enough liquidity to secure her family fortune in cash, rather than ownership of a team, she’s likely to jump at it.</p> <p>The Lakers’ new owners are likely to do very well on their investment. The decline of cable is a major threat to professional sports teams, and some smaller-market clubs in the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball have taken substantial cash flow hits as regional carriers have faded. But the Lakers are so entwined with one of the world’s largest cities that to bet against their continued growth is to bet against the future popularity of basketball, the city of Los Angeles and live entertainment altogether. Angelenos will not stop buying Lakers tickets and, even more critically, will not stop happily paying to watch 82 games per year, whether they’re doing that on a streamer or traditional TV. The Lakers are too big to fail, and some time down the line, someone will value them at well more than $10bn.</p>    <p>The sale will probably be good for Lakers fans, though they are not the priority in any transaction of this type. Walter’s group has done wonders with the Dodgers, seizing on the franchise’s natural advantages – a rabid fanbase and a location players want to play in – and turned the team into the most consistent winner in baseball. It is harder to flex a financial advantage in the NBA than in salary cap-less MLB, but Walter’s Dodgers have become the team <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6406636/2025/06/11/best-worst-mlb-manager-2025-player-poll/\">with the best reputation among ballplayers</a>. Not that the Lakers have a hard time attracting stars, but one could imagine them attracting even more of the players they covet. At the end of the day, isn’t that kind of product what fans want to see?</p> <p>While this will all likely go fine for the Lakers, the shift in ownership models does raise questions about what will become of sports teams that <em>don’t </em>defy gravity by their very existence. Plenty of individual club owners have been massive flops who have earned the endless scorn of their clubs’ fans. But the fact of having one highly visible, specific owner has at least rendered a version of accountability. After all, it’s easier for Manchester United fans to chant “Glazers out!” than it would be to chant “shadowy consortium of institutional investors out!” A move toward large groups of investors controlling iconic teams will make it easier for individual actors to milk them for cash without facing the kind of public shaming that has long been possible for teams with more identifiable villains in the owner’s suite. The Lakers are big enough and successful enough that this dynamic might never come to a head. Most teams can’t say the same.</p>",

With a few exceptions, the tournament is being playing in massive NFL stadiums, and that means a lot of empty seats.</p> \n<p>The environments, though, have largely been very good. South American fans in particular have brought it, with Brazilians in New York and Argentinians in Miami creating noisy and invested atmospheres that seem right at home at a tournament with the World Cup name.</p> \n<p>Thanks to the massiveness of these stadiums, though, the optics are not always the best.</p> \n<h2><strong>Heat and weather</strong></h2> \n<p>It’s been hot at times, but the tournament has also been lucky so far in that many cities, especially New York, have been experiencing cooler-than-normal temperatures over the past week. The most notable exception was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/15/psg-atletico-madrid-club-world-cup\">Paris Saint-Germain v Atlético Madrid</a> at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, where the heat combined with crowd control issues and a lack of water contributed to what the Guardian was told was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/17/club-world-cup-fans-dangerous-conditions-rose-bowl-california-heat-water\">a “dangerous” environment for fans</a>. It wasn’t comfortable for the players either.</p> \n<p>“Playing in this heat is impossible,” Atlético’s Marcos Llorente said. “The heat is terrible. My toes hurt, even my toenails … We are adapting to the heat of playing at these hours … no one in Europe is used to it.”</p> \n<p>The next several days will see more of these situations. A brutal heatwave is set to hit much of the eastern United States starting on Friday, covering many of the stadiums where the remaining games will be played. Evening kick-offs will be hot but theoretically bearable once the sun is down. The problematic games will be those that kick off in the afternoon local time – there are 14 of those left in the group stage, including six that start at noon, when the heat will probably be at its worst in the direct sunlight.</p> \n<p>And that’s without even getting into weather delays. Already, there have been three – mostly for lightning as thunderstorms have gathered amid the humid weather. There is very little Fifa can do about those, of course – but it’s a trend worth keeping an eye on. There is a chance, of course, the delays could disrupt the simultaneous kick-offs in the group finales.</p> \n<h2><strong>Political unrest</strong></h2> \n<p>The opening matches of this tournament were awash with reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and/or Customs and Border Protection officers would be present at games and looking to continue their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/ice-agents-dodger-stadium-los-angeles\">public raids</a>, which have been met with counterprotests across the country. That has yet to happen.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake, security is high at these games, as they are at any major sporting event in the United States. But there haven’t been any reported attempts at mass arrests as there have been in other places around the country.</p> \n<p>That is not to say politics, world events and the tournament haven’t overlapped. Mehdi Taremi, Inter’s Iran striker, has been forced to miss the tournament after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/14/inter-mehdi-taremi-club-world-cup-israel-iran\">stuck in Tehran</a> after Israel’s attacks on the city. And this week Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, and a delegation from Juventus (including the US internationals Weston McKennie and Tim Weah) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2025/jun/18/trump-juventus-white-house-visit\">stood in the Oval Office</a> as Donald Trump answered questions about a potential war with Iran and awkwardly asked the players if women could play for Juventus (a reference to the rightwing talking point about trans women in women’s sports).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0dc83d05-cdbf-4865-9d3f-4631e12a54a4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BwoUZe5OE3I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Club performances</strong></h2> \n<p>On the field, the story of the tournament so far has been the performance of South American clubs. Teams representing Conmebol have not lost, the only undefeated confederation remaining after one matchday in every group. They’ve achieved some pretty big results along the way – including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/19/inter-miami-porto-lionel-messi-club-world-cup\">Botafogo’s 1-0 win</a> over the Champions League winners, PSG, on Thursday night, and Boca Juniors’ 2-2 draw with Benfica.</p> \n<p>Asian and Oceanian teams are having far less fun. The confederations’ five teams have yet to win, with Auckland City suffering a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/15/bayern-munich-auckland-city-club-world-cup\">10-0 demolition</a> by Bayern Munich. The lone bright spot for Asian clubs was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/real-madrid-al-hilal-club-world-cup-match-report\">Al-Hilal’s 1-1 draw with Real Madrid</a> – a game in which the Saudi Pro League side looked every bit Madrid’s equals in Xabi Alonso’s first game in charge.</p> \n<p>Generally speaking, and in line with past editions of the Club World Cup, the so-called “smaller” teams are the ones bringing real life to this party, while most Uefa teams are waiting for their first big challenge. The final group games and knockouts should be plenty of fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Standout players</strong></h2> \n<p>It’s a bit early to say anyone is making a case for the Golden Ball given most teams have played one game, but a few players have stood out.</p> \n<p>One, unsurprisingly, is Lionel Messi. The Inter Miami superstar is a player Fifa bent over backwards to get into the tournament, awarding his team a “host nation” slot after they failed to qualify through other means. That decision has paid off. Messi is 37 and has clearly slowed a little, but he remains capable of delivering in big moments, as he did with a winning free-kick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/19/inter-miami-porto-lionel-messi-club-world-cup\">goal against Porto</a>.</p> \n<p>Pretty much every Bayern player stands out after that ridiculous scoreline, even if it came against amateur opposition. Jamal Musiala has the early claim on the Golden Boot, having scored a hat-trick in that game.</p> \n<p>For Manchester City, Phil Foden got off on the right foot with a goal and an assist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/manchester-city-wydad-club-world-cup-match-report\">against Wydad</a>, and Chelsea’s new signing Liam Delap made a positive impact on his debut, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/16/chelsea-lafc-club-world-cup-match-report\">2-0 win</a> over Los Angeles FC.</p> \n<p>Kylian Mbappé, meanwhile, has been a notable absence, having been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/19/real-madrid-kylian-mbappe-in-hospital-gastroenteritis-club-world-cup\">briefly in hospital</a> this week with gastroenteritis.</p>",

It would be wrong to say that, when you bring forward big reforms there aren’t concerns and there aren’t dissenting voices, of course there are. But Vicky is the only frontbencher that I’ve had a conversation with about resigning.”</p> <p>Asked how many backbench Labour MPs had approached her with worries about the plans, she said: “A handful have expressed concerns about the detail, and I’m really confident that we’ve listened and we’ve put forward a package that is absolutely right.”</p> <p>Foxcroft said on Thursday night she was unable to do her job as a whip because she disagreed with the changes and did not believe that cuts were part of the solution to rising inactivity.</p> <p>The changes, which are at the centre of a £4.8bn welfare reduction programme, will mean even people who are unable to wash half their body or cook a meal will be denied the payments if they have no other impairments.</p> <p>In a letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft said the benefits system was “in desperate need of reform” but that her pre-election experience as shadow disability minister had shown her the struggles of disabled people were “even tougher than I had imagined”.</p> <p>Nandy said the measures were about helping people back to work rather than making immediate savings to the welfare bill, even though the benefit is paid regardless of employment status.</p> <p>She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Lots of people want to work and just can’t at the moment, because we’re not helping them to do so. I think we’ve struck the right balance between that and protecting people who will never be able to work.”</p> <p>Ministers have previously said the Pip cuts are being made to make the system more financially sustainable.</p>",

IP protection; come on, let’s get on with it.”</p> <p>The industry would like an opt-in regime, forcing AI companies to seek permission and strike licensing deals with copyright holders before they can use the content to train their models.</p> <p>In October, Rupert Murdoch’s Dow Jones, the owner of the Wall Street Journal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/21/rupert-murdoch-ai-lawsuit-new-york-post-dow-jones\">filed a lawsuit against Perplexity</a>, accusing it of engaging in a “massive amount of illegal copying” in a “brazen scheme … free-riding on the valuable content the publishers produce”.</p> <p>Perplexity told the FT that the BBC’s claims were “manipulative and opportunistic” and that it had a “fundamental misunderstanding of technology, the internet and intellectual property law”.</p> <p>Perplexity does not build or train foundation models – unlike other companies such as OpenAI, Google and Meta – but provides an interface that allows users to choose between them.</p> <p>The BBC said that parts of its content had been reproduced verbatim by Perplexity.</p> <p>“Perplexity’s tool directly competes with the BBC’s own services, circumventing the need for users to access those services,” the corporation said.</p> <p>In October, the BBC began registering copyright in its news website in the US, so it is entitled to “statutory damages in relation to unauthorised use of these copyright works”.</p> <p>In the UK, original proposals published in a consultation indicated that the government could let AI companies scrape content unless media owners opt out, which the industry said would “scrape the value” out of the £125bn creative industry.</p> <p>Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, has since said that the government has no preferred option regarding AI copyright laws in the UK but promised the creative sector that it would not be harmed by legislation.</p> <p>“We are a Labour government, and the principle [that] people must be paid for their work is foundational,” she told a media conference earlier this month. “You have our word that if it doesn’t work for the creative industries, it will not work for us.”</p> <p>Publishers including the Financial Times, Axel Springer, Hearst and News Corporation have signed content licensing deals with OpenAI.</p> <p>Reuters has struck a deal with Meta, and the parent of the Daily Mail has an agreement with <a href=\"http://prorata.ai\">ProRata.ai</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian has approached Perplexity for comment. The BBC declined to comment beyond the contents of the letter.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Duo Ruut (Square Duo) are Ann-Lisett Rebane and Katariina Kivi, two Estonian musicians who write, sing and play facing each other, their instrument being a single <em>kannel</em> (an Estonian zither). Playing with the texts and repetitive motifs of <em>runo</em> song, a form of traditional oral poetry specific to the Baltic Finnic languages, their music holds a glistening minimalism in its rhythms and a crossover sheen in its sound. Rebane and Kivi’s voices help – often sweet, but also sharp when required.</p>    <p>Their ambitious second album Ilmateade (Weather Report) explores the powerful yet under-sung connections between the weather and emotion. It begins with the minute-long Intro, a track that builds gorgeously on the scratchy, dying notes of their 2021 EP, Kulla Kerguseks (From the Lightness of Gold), implying both continuity and metamorphosis.<br><br>Then we’re in Udu (Fog), lulled along on thick, beautiful clouds of shifting time signatures, before Vastlalaul (The Sledding Song) slows and speeds, glossily, through the snow. These songs are rhythmically complex and have solid, ancient roots, but fans of ambient, Balearic dreaminess and the softer sides of indie pop and psych-folk will find woozy comforts here.</p> <p>Good entry points include the earwormy melancholia of Vilud Ilmad (Gloomy Weather) and the itchy handclaps, in five beats to the bar, propelling us through Suvi Rannas (Summer on the Beach), in which we’re told, in Estonian, of days hot with horseflies and a sky broad and bare.</p> <p>Other Estonian artists brought into the fold provide different depths. Guitarist Erki Pärnoja’s solos swirl around the women’s wordless melodies on Interlude, while poet EiK 2509 adds spoken-word contributions to the mesmerising Enne Ööd (Nightfall). All together, these 12 tracks create a hypnotic shipping forecast transplanted to the Baltic Sea, carrying us along on its eddying tides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Duo Ruut: Ilmateade\">  <iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0UBweCyjSzQ5Mm3isP6Jhl?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Also out this month</h2> <p><strong>Jennifer Reid</strong>’s The Ballad of the Gatekeeper (self-released) is a full-blooded fantastic debut from a singer who researches 19th-century broadside ballads, has acted in BBC Two’s The Gallows Pole and supported Pulp and Eliza Carthy on tour. Mixing centuries-old working songs with new material about fast fashion, climate breakdown and Covid, she’s a striking talent – her a cappellas especially full of bite. <strong>Brìghde Chaimbeul</strong>’s Sunwise (Tak:til/Glitterbeat) eerily transports us from high summer to songs of midwinter. Her smallpipe drones are less abrasive than on 2023’s brilliant, abrasive Carry Them With Us, but her <em>canntaireachd</em> singing (a style deliberately vocalising bagpipes) is more propulsive, heavy and completely compelling. Similarly bewitching are Norwegian trio <strong>Hekate</strong>. Their new album, Evigheten Forestår (Eternity Imagines), collects <em>slåttetralling</em><strong> </strong>(Norwegian vocal dance tune improvisations) from across their homeland, their tones by turns spiky, perky, sad and sacred.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The third album by these New York-based indie-rockers rings some crucial changes. First, bandleader Will Anderson is in love, which alleviates some of the gloom that pervaded earlier records. And while the lyrics don’t amount to much on the page, when sung in unaffected deadpan and robed in artfully embellished shoegazey noise, Anderson’s elliptical poetics carry a compelling weight.</p>    <p>Second, and more importantly, Anderson invited his bandmates into the studio to record Raspberry Moon. Where previous albums had been one-man affairs, with Anderson overdubbing layer upon layer of guitar and synth on his lonesome, the presence of other musicians in the room has shaken up the paradigm. Their trademark walls of fuzz remain, but Raspberry Moon also fields tracks such as Break Right, on which the happy/sad melodies flourish with space to breathe, and the lush Lawnmower, which is practically unplugged (save for a keening thread of feedback in the distance) and utterly lovely for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Hotline TNT: Raspberry Moon\">  <iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3MVdeSmUl32TTzLy6dFFtZ?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other tracks hew closer to the Hotline blueprint, but with renewed sophistication. Their sound remains rooted in 90s indie-rock’s fusion of noise and tune (the closing track even shares its title with a landmark Dinosaur Jr LP), but Anderson’s articulacy within this soundworld is impressive. The Scene may recall the corrosive buzz of Sugar and the tremolo swoon of My Bloody Valentine, but Anderson’s mastery of dynamics is thrilling. And the way he weaves acoustic and distorted guitars and blasts of needling feedback into something as beguiling as Julia’s War is evidence of a unique talent operating in a crowded field.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>WR Chess, the star-studded world top 10 team, retained their World Team Blitz crown in London last week, but only after an almighty scare and with significant help from the appeals committee. WR had already been beaten for the World Rapid title by MGD1, a Pune-based group led by India’s Arjun Erigaisi.</p> <p>WR lost 2-4 to Germany in their Blitz quarter-final, but got the match annulled on the grounds that they had been advised of the wrong start time so had arrived two minutes late for a three-minute game. All the other teams arrived on time.</p> <p>WR stands for Wadim Rosenstein, a tech billionaire who plays on the amateur board of his team and who persuaded Fide to launch this new competition two years ago. His squad even included Magnus Carlsen until the No 1 fell out with Fide.</p> <p>WR Chess defeated Kazakhstan in the gold medal blitz match, with Hexamind third. Earlier, Erigaisi’s MGD1 won Rapid gold, with Levon Aronian’s Hexamind taking silver and Vishy Anand’s Freedom winning bronze.</p> <p>Leading English teams disappointed, although all gained valuable experience against top opposition. The national squad, named Malcolm’s Mates after England’s international director, Malcolm Pein, suffered on the top boards in the Rapid as Luke McShane scored 2/9 and Gawain Jones 3/8, and never looked like matching their seeding of third. The Blitz went better, but in the last 16 Malcolm’s Mates were paired against the WR Chess heavyweights and were overwhelmed 9.5-2.5.</p>    <p>WR Chess had an epic group match against the all-junor Turkish Airlines squad, who rose to the occasion with an impressive performance.</p> <p>Argentina’s 11-year-old prodigy Faustino Oro drew easily with Russia’s No 1, Ian Nepomniachtchi, then forecast himself to become world champion in 2032. The English teenagers Sohum Lohia and Indy Southcott-Moyers fought well against the world stars Jan-Krzysztof Duda and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, China’s Lu Miaoyi drew with the all-time No 2 woman, Hou Yifan, and, most remarkable of all, a little-known 13-year-old from Azerbaijan, Khagan Ahmad, beat the US world No 2 and popular streamer, Hikaru Nakamura, in a marathon 112-move queen ending. All six games of this match are <a href=\"https://lichess.org/broadcast/fide-world-rapid--blitz-team-championships-2025--blitz-pool-a/round-5/OmEr58j2/aUqJjAoS\">here</a>.</p> <p>Unknowns of all ages very occasionally catch top stars out, but it normally occurs due to a sudden tactic that the great one overlooks, not after a prolonged marathon with the loser fighting tooth and nail. For a historic comparison to Ahmad v Nakamura, I think of David Bronstein Hugh Alexander, <a href=\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1156490\">Hastings 1953-54</a>.</p> <p>Several of the best-known world talents made significant advances in London. Besides Oro, the Turkish pair of Ediz Gurel and Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus both totalled 8.5/12 in Rapid, while Russia’s 10-year-old youngest ever IM, Roman Shogdzhiev, who Carlsen recently named, along with Erdogmus, as a potential world champion of the future, achieved a 2500 rating performance in Rapid.</p> <p>Many England juniors gained experience in the World Rapid and Blitz, but few could boast successes on the score table. The dedicated squads from Chess Trust Accelerators and the UK Chess Challenge could not match their more experienced opponents.</p> <p>There was one exception, though. Bodhana Sivanandan, England’s youngest ever Olympiad player, had her best result for many months. The 10-year-old, competing for her sponsor GM Ali Mortazavi’s firm e-therapeutics, unleashed a blitz sequence that included the best individual score for her team, an unbeaten 10-game run and five wins in a row, plus a 2307 rating performance.</p> <p><strong>3977</strong><strong>:</strong> It’s mate in six by 1…Rg4+! 2 hxg4 (if 2 Kxh5 Qxh3 mate) Qh1+ 3 Kg5 f6+ 4 Kg6 Qe4+ 5 Kxh5 Qh7+ 6 Qh6 Qxh6 mate.</p>",

Blair Kinghorn aside, they all arrived into camp with a spring in their step and a smile on their face because their dreams have been realised. Speaking from experience, it is amazing how quickly you can leave national allegiances at the door.</p> <p>At this stage, there is no sense of what the Test team will be, no division, or feeling that you have to make do with being a midweek dirt-tracker – the thing you are probably most nervous about is who your roommate will be. You know it will be someone from a different country and my first roommate was Keith Earls. As the youngest member of the 2009 squad, he was responsible for looking after the Lions mascot and I felt like I needed to mind him. I soon realised there are few as competitive as Keith and he did not need minding at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/18/maro-itoje-captain-british-irish-lions-argentina-dublin-rugby-union-tour-australia\">Marcus Smith at full-back against Argentina as Lions aim to ‘set tone’ for tour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can arrive into camp with preconceived ideas of what certain people will be like. Whenever I had played against Ronan O’Gara I had to be so mentally switched on because he was such a fierce competitor with incredible drive and had this uncanny ability to catch you out of position with a spiral kick. He was pretty chirpy on the pitch too, but he is someone I am still in touch with to this day.</p> <p>There were quite a few players about whom I was thinking: “I’m not quite sure about you, I may not even like you.” But you then meet them and spend time in their company and you switch to: “This is my teammate,” and feeling: “This means everything,” really quickly.</p> <p>I’m sure the current bunch have already had a few good nights out and they need that. They will learn more about each other from 30 minutes in the pub than they ever would in the gym or on the training ground.</p> <p>Friday’s match against Argentina is a first hit-out but, at the same time, it is probably the hardest game they will play before the Test series. If Argentina were playing against Australia on Friday, I’m not sure who my money would be on.</p> <p>It’s a daunting fixture but the Lions have to embrace it. They can’t worry themselves about underdogs tags – this is the best of the best from the four nations and there can be no excuses. I don’t expect them to be perfect against the Pumas but the minimum I want to see is evidence of what they are trying to do in attack and defence.</p> <p>Make no mistake, everyone wants to play in the first match. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/14/leinster-bulls-united-rugby-championship-final-match-report#:~:text=Jordie%20Barrett%20helps%20Leinster%20cruise%20past%20the%20Bulls%20and%20win%20URC%20final,-URC%20final%3A%20Leinster&amp;amp;text=Leinster%20lifted%20their%20first%20trophy,at%20Croke%20Park%20on%20Saturday.\">all the Leinster players</a> who were in action against the Bulls last Saturday, even Finn Russell after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/15/finn-russell-bath-premiership-rugby-british-irish-lions-test\">topless celebrations during Bath’s</a> open-top bus parade on Sunday. That said, as much as there can be a sense of Fomo for all those not involved, there can be some Romo – relief at missing out – too.</p>    <p>In 2009, I was desperate to play in the first match of the tour against the Royal XV and gutted to be overlooked. As it turned out, those who were selected didn’t cover themselves in glory, needed a late comeback to avoid defeat and those players suddenly had some catching up to do. It’s amazing how your currency can rise when you’re not involved.</p> <p>The team Andy Farrell has selected is largely as you’d expect, all players who were at the Portugal camp, but I’m delighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/18/maro-itoje-captain-british-irish-lions-argentina-dublin-rugby-union-tour-australia\">Marcus Smith gets an early opportunity</a> to show what he’s all about. During the Six Nations he just got on with the job, having last year been England’s most dominant player only to find himself out of favour or playing in a position that isn’t his most preferred.</p> <p>As it has turned out, that versatility has worked to his advantage and when I look at this Lions backline, I see a lot of muscle, a lot of physical specimens, and the need for a second pair of playmaking hands becomes clear.</p> <p>You would still say Kinghorn is the favourite to fill that role, but given he is still involved with Toulouse, Smith has the chance to lay down a marker. And he must stay true to himself to do that. He is an incredible individual talent but he’s also a selfless player. Everything he does is with an eye on creating space for his teammates and Farrell will be aware of the threat he poses if Duhan van der Merwe, Bundee Aki, Sione Tuipulotu and Tommy Freeman can deliver front-foot ball.</p> <p>Smith will have to be mindful of the aerial threat Argentina pose. He will be only too familiar with how strong Rodrigo Isgró is in the air given they are teammates at Harlequins. Smith constantly looks to Isgró with the boot to win the ball back, so effective is the winger in that regard. But Argentina have threats all over the park.</p> <p>It is a mighty challenge for the Lions first up, but the XV selected have got the ability to deal with it.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Developing countries need a fresh round of debt relief, to prevent money urgently needed for health and education being diverted to creditors, according to a major new report commissioned by the late Pope Francis.</p> <p>The Jubilee report, produced by a panel of experts chaired by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, argues for debt restructuring, along the lines of the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/debt/brief/hipc\">Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative</a> (HIPC).</p> <p>Stiglitz told the Guardian that many developing countries are facing a “perfect storm” as they had little choice but to ramp up borrowing through the Covid crisis and subsequently faced sharply higher interest rates as central banks battled to tackle inflation.</p> <p>“Now, because of Trump tariffs, there’s a global slowdown expected and that will give them even less revenue, and potentially it could lead to higher inflation and that again would lead to even higher interest rates. It’s one thing after another,” Stiglitz said.</p> <p>The report warns that many governments, fearful of the consequences of default, “prioritise timely debt payments over essential development spending. This is not a path to sustainable development. Rather, it is a roadblock to development and leads to increasing inequality and discontent.”</p> <p>The HIPC debt relief programme emerged out of a concerted campaign by civil society groups, including churches, calling for a “jubilee” for cash-starved developing countries.</p> <p>The initiative saw more than $100bn of debt cancelled – including as a result of commitments made at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/06/make-poverty-history-campaign-gleneagles-sustainable-development-goals\">Gleneagles G8 summit</a>, chaired by the UK.</p> <p>With 2025 designated a jubilee year by the Catholic church, Pope Francis commissioned the new report, to explore how the current debt crisis could be tackled. He called last year for “an international mechanism for debt restructuring based on the solidarity and harmony of peoples.” The report will be presented to his successor, Leo XIV, at the Vatican on Friday.</p> <p>The research underscores the gravity of the situation for many countries, warning: “The consequences are particularly acute in Africa, where debt distress is most severe. Approximately 57% of the continent’s population – 751 million people, including nearly 288 million living in extreme poverty – reside in countries that spend more on servicing external debt than on education or healthcare.”</p> <p>The authors warn that the impact is likely to be rising poverty and malnutrition, the “erosion of hope” and “deepening social fractures”.</p> <p>They also point out that the situation is more complex than in the early 2000s, when much of the debt was owed to governments, or other public sector bodies.</p> <p>“The international community has a moral obligation to advance a ‘HIPC II.’ However, the challenges of implementing such a comprehensive solution today are greater than those faced during the original HIPC initiative,” the report says.</p> <p>As well as debt write-offs, the report argues for a series of technical and legal changes to the global financial system, to tackle the debt crisis and prevent it recurring again.</p> <p>These include backing calls for legislation in the UK, where much sovereign debt is issued, that would force private sector creditors to bear their fair share of write-offs in any debt restructuring agreement. “The private guys shouldn’t get more than the public guys,” said Stiglitz.</p> <p>The authors also argue for a “no bailout clause” that would stop rescue loans offered by the International Monetary Fund to hard-pressed governments being used to pay off private sector lenders.</p> <p>Governments are due to discuss debt relief at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Seville at the end of this month.</p> <p>A draft outcome document was agreed this week, including a commitment to seek “an intergovernmental process at the United Nations, with a view to make recommendations for closing gaps in the debt architecture and exploring options to address debt sustainability”.</p> <p>That was significantly weaker than language advocated by African governments, that would have promised “far reaching reform” of the global system and “a more comprehensive, fair and effective multilateral mechanism for preventing and resolving sovereign debt crises”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/starmer-urged-to-attend-un-summit-back-plans-to-tackle-global-debt-crisis\">Keir Starmer has been urged</a> by the directors of scores of UK charities and campaign groups to attend the summit in person and back plans for debt relief.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>From Los Angeles to London, Istanbul to Warsaw, cities are making rightwing populists angry. Their liberal elites, immigrants, net zero policies, leftwing activists, globalised businesses, expensive transport infrastructure and outspoken municipal leaders – all are provocations to populist politicians whose support often comes from more conservative, less privileged places.</p> <p>Three years ago the founders of national conservatism, the transatlantic ideology on which much of modern rightwing populism is based, published a statement of principles. One of these, surprisingly little noticed at the time, <a href=\"https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/national-conservatism-a-statement-of-principles/\">declared</a> with some menace: “In those [places] in which law and justice have been manifestly corrupted, or in which lawlessness, immorality, and dissolution reign, national government must intervene energetically to restore order.”</p> <p>This month, Donald Trump’s administration identified the first American city – and almost certainly not the last – to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/trump-military-force-plotting\">meet these ominously broad criteria</a>. “Los Angeles has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens,” he said. It was “a city of criminals” and “socialists”, said his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem. “Mob violence” was so disrupting the work of the federal government there, claimed his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, that an “insurrection” was under way. Trump promised: “We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean and safe again.”</p> <p>That this “liberation” involved an ongoing, expanding and legally contentious military occupation – almost unprecedented in American history – is one indicator of how deep the populist animosity towards liberal cities and their leaders runs. Another is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/24/ekrem-imamoglu-jailed-rival-turkish-president-could-emerge-stronger\">recent imprisonment</a> of the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem İmamoğlu, a challenger to the authoritarian Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for the Turkish presidency. Another is the level of security required for London’s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, which is similar to that for Keir Starmer and King Charles.</p> <p>The death threats, public abuse and state aggression endured by such municipal figures in supposedly free democracies – along with slightly more subtle anti-urban interventions, such as Nigel Farage’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/28/nigel-farage-ukip-immigration-speech\">complaint</a> in 2014 that he could not “hear English” on an inner London train – reveal much about rightwing populism, its anxieties and fundamental values. Cities are where the future often starts, and populism is often about holding on to the past.</p> <p>While conservative populism reveres, or says it reveres, the nation state, the countryside, community, social continuity and the traditional family, cities are often places of more fluid loyalties. While populism presents politics as a simple battle between “the people” and their enemies, cities, by gathering so many interest groups in one place, show that politics is in fact a more complex process: involving competition but also cooperation, contests over space and resources, and many social forces, including class, gender, sexuality, local pride and race.</p> <p>More enraging and disorienting still for conservative populists, over the past 30 years many big cities have changed. Trump acknowledges this by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/trump-administration-los-angeles-national-guard\">describing</a> Los Angeles as “once great”. As Mike Davis laid out in his <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-unfulfilled-american-dream-stalks-mike-daviss-dystopian-los-angeles-in-his-masterful-city-of-quartz-193629\">pioneering histories</a> of the city, for most of the 20th century Los Angeles was, behind its laid-back image, a highly conservative place: racially segregated, repressively policed, ruled by Republican mayors as much as Democrats. Immigration, radical activism, more progressive administrations and liberal gentrification gradually altered the city so that now, while still often shaped by inequalities, it is a stronghold of the centre left.</p> <p>A similar shift has happened since the 1990s in Paris, London and many other European and North American cities. For the right, the loss of these prestigious places has been a bitter defeat – hence their insistence that they have been ruined by liberals and the left. Khan’s centrist mayoralty in London has used its very limited powers to provide free meals for primary schoolchildren and give the capital cleaner air, yet is routinely described by the rightwing press as a dogmatic and disastrous experiment.</p> <p>Such caricatures of cities and their government are all the more unconvincing because they ignore the political complexity of these places. Forty percent of Londoners <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36612916\">voted for Brexit</a>, and many of the city’s immigrants are social conservatives. Some of its supposedly most rigid leftwing areas have, or have had, well-known rightwingers as residents: Boris Johnson and Paul Dacre, the ferociously illiberal former Daily Mail editor, used to live in Islington, north London. Dominic Cummings still does. At a Turkish greengrocer in the borough, I sometimes see the Tory MP Nick Timothy – who recently told the House of Commons: “Diversity is not our strength: it is a very serious and difficult challenge” – queueing seemingly quite happily as the shop hums with different languages, before returning to his home in the even more diverse borough of Hackney.</p> <p>For all the aspects of city life that infuriate those on the right, there are others you might expect to please them: the emphasis on work, the entrepreneurialism, huge importance of property and endless hierarchies. These priorities and divides could push cities back to the right. In the 1980s, much of London elected Tory MPs. Paris had a conservative mayor, Jacques Chirac, from 1977 to 1995.</p> <p>Yet a return to urban conservatism feels less likely with the right in populist mode. As the Economist magazine – not usually an ally of the municipal left – recently pointed out, city government needs “pragmatic politicos who keep … the roads free of potholes … [and] buses running on time”. The broad-brush, administratively chaotic politics of Trump, Farage and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives don’t seem well suited to such tasks.</p> <p>Perhaps that doesn’t matter to the populists. They can go on attacking cities, in order to stir up their voters elsewhere, without actually having to run them. Meanwhile, liberal and leftwing municipal politicians keep key economic and tourism hubs functional, leaving populist national politicians such as Trump free to promote less practical policies. He may hate contemporary Los Angeles and California, but the state’s economy <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly80zlk1lyo#:~:text=Image%20caption%2C,the%20world's%20leading%20tech%20companies.&amp;text=California's%20economy%20has%20overtaken%20that,fourth%20largest%20global%20economic%20force.\">recently overtook</a> Japan’s to become the world’s fourth largest – helpful for a president whose own economic plan is misfiring.</p> <p>Yet the urban resistance to rightwing populism shouldn’t be written off as just playing into the enemy’s hands, as some political pessimists have done during the protests in Los Angeles. Whether on the street or from a grand mayoral office, defying today’s intolerant, reactionary populists has a value – as an act in itself and as an encouragement to others. City life can be grim and disappointing. But one of its virtues is that while trends come and go fast, rebellions are rarely forgotten.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

The chances of him ever playing for Manchester United look slim-to-none as he will not be given a boarding pass for the club’s US tour, while a dream move to Barcelona is going up in smoke. A few Serie A clubs have had a sniff but his wages may be a stumbling block. What he really needs is a Champions League club with plenty of cash. Step in … Newcastle. The Magpies are back in the bigger time, will be eager to make a statement signing or two, and Rashford fits the bill. Liam Delap chose Chelsea over Newcastle and Eddie Howe likes to have the best English talent at his disposal, so Rashford would be an ideal candidate as an extra attacking option.</p> <p>It takes a brave man to move from Liverpool to Everton (and vice versa). Nick Barmby, Abel Xavier and Gary Ablett did the Merseyside double in their time and the next potential candidate is <strong>Ben Doak</strong>. The Scottish teenager impressed on loan in the Championship last season at Middlesbrough and is ready to step up to the Premier League but there is no obvious role he can play under Arne Slot. It means Doak might need to find an alternative and at least this one would mean he didn’t have to move house.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2025/may/28/mens-transfer-window-summer-2025-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1\">Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another potential Liverpool exitee is <strong>Jarell Quansah</strong>.

A year ago the Crystal Palace captain was subject to bids from Newcastle but £65m was deemed insufficient and the Eagles are unlikely to have dropped their price.</p> <p>Burnley are seeking some extra quality now they are back in the promised land. One potential incoming is the Lazio winger <strong>Loum Tchaouna</strong>, who could head from Rome to Turf Moor in a deal worth in the vicinity of £12m.</p> <p><strong>Igor Thiago</strong> has endured a difficult time at Brentford through a mixture of injury and the form of Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. Despite the fact at least one of those forwards will depart this summer, the Brazilian could also be allowed to leave, with Besiktas contemplating a move for the former Club Brugge man.</p> <p>Speaking of those who could swap London for Istanbul, José Mourinho is eager to bring <strong>Thomas Partey</strong> to Fenerbahce for absolutely nothing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/19/thomas-partey-rejects-arsenal-contract-extension-leaving-future-in-doubt\">The midfielder’s contract</a> is days away from expiring and Arsenal and the player have failed to agree a new one, leaving him free to leave.</p> <p>Napoli are eager to add to Kevin De Bruyne in midfield and are targeting Brighton’s <strong>Matt O’Riley</strong>.

The shrugging demeanour adds to the mystique. Kids copy the Chelsea attacker’s “cold” celebration. Interviewers walk away amused but bemused after spending time with him. What’s the story with those answers? Why are they all so short and sweet?</p> <p>The Philadelphia sun is beating down when Palmer mooches over for a quick chat at Subaru Park, where Chelsea are training before facing Flamengo in their second game at the Club World Cup on Friday. So, Cole, can you tell us why you walked out wearing a mask when the team plane landed in the US last week? Are you ill? Enzo Maresca, your manager, thinks you were playing a trick on everyone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/16/chelsea-lafc-club-world-cup-match-report\">Delap impact helps Chelsea see off LAFC at Club World Cup but fans stay away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It wasn’t a joke,” he says. “I just don’t like the smelly planes. That’s why I wear a mask. When I travel I don’t like the smells so that’s why I wear them. Nothing else. Enzo doesn’t know. I didn’t tell him. But he didn’t ask me, to be fair.”</p> <p>It is straight to the point with Palmer, who turned 23 in May. He has enjoyed a rapid rise to fame and does not really understand why he attracts so much attention. He still finds being recognised when he goes out in London a strange experience. “I am just a normal kid,” he says. “When people do stuff like that I think: ‘Why me?’”</p> <p>The answer is that Palmer is one of the most enjoyable players in the Premier League, a free spirit, a bit of a throwback to when the game was less rigid and less systems‑based. No wonder he is on so many of the billboards promoting the Club World Cup in Philadelphia. Palmer is by far the biggest draw at Chelsea. While there is a sense that he is more aware of his worth than he makes out, it is hard to see the fame going to his head.</p> <p>“I still do the same things I did before I came to Chelsea,” he says. “I try and think it’s just a game of football, it’s not life or death. I just try and enjoy it. I like to go and play five-a-side and just do normal things. I like PlayStation.”</p>    <p>The Normal One, then. Only, Palmer is capable of doing the extraordinary when he plays. He turned the game with two fabulous assists when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/28/real-betis-chelsea-europa-conference-league-final-match-report\">Chelsea beat Real Betis in the Uefa Conference League final</a> in May. Afterwards, he talked about growing tired with playing backwards and sideways when behind in that game. It led to suggestions that Palmer was having a dig at Maresca’s tactics.</p> <p>There was no drama, though. Maresca has since made it clear that he wants his best player to produce those off-the-cuff moments from first minute to last. “We had a joke about it,” Palmer says. “My comments weren’t towards the manager or anything. It was just a personal thing. I felt I was maybe being a bit safe. That’s where the comment came from. I wanted to get the ball and try something different. You can’t take the piss and do whatever you want, but I feel like he still gives you a little bit of room to try and see what I can do.”</p> <p>Palmer’s form was exceptional during the first half of the season. He was directly involved in 53 goals in his first 50 Premier League starts for Chelsea. Palmer dipped after Christmas and went 18 games without scoring but took things in his stride. A dismissal of “social media idiots” after he ended his barren run with a typically cool penalty during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/04/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea’s victory over Liverpool last month</a> was classic Palmer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/28/real-betis-chelsea-europa-conference-league-final-match-report\">Chelsea and Cole Palmer storm back at Real Betis to win Conference League</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He is ready to accept more responsibility. Chelsea will play in the Champions League next season and will need Palmer to be at his best. For now, though, the focus is on becoming world champions. No doubt the marketing team at Chelsea were pleased Palmer swapped the No 20 shirt for the famous No 10 – previously worn by Mykhailo Mudryk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/mykhailo-mudryk-chelsea-could-face-four-year-ban-fa-charge-failed-drugs-test\">who has been charged by the Football Association with doping offences</a> – before the start of the tournament.</p> <p>“I wore No 10 all my life growing up,” says Palmer. Lionel Messi and Wayne Rooney were two of his heroes. He also loved Eden Hazard, who wore No 10 at Chelsea. He feels like the Belgian winger’s successor. Hazard, who was Chelsea’s star talent before leaving in 2019, was similarly down-to‑earth. “I have seen him a few times at the training ground,” Palmer says. “He asked me for one of my shirts for his sons.” It all sounds reassuringly normal.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>“I can’t believe that somehow I&nbsp;was able to make it all the way to the age of 55 without having read that book!” says American singer-songwriter John Grant. “It’s a transformative book. I was just completely blown away by it; I’ve been&nbsp;trying to get everybody that I’ve&nbsp;ever met to read it.”</p> <p>The book Grant is telling me about, enthusing from his sofa at home in Reykjavík, is Christopher Isherwood’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/20/100-best-novels-a-single-man-christopher-isherwood\">A Single Man</a>, published in 1964, turned into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/11/a-single-man-review\">2009’s most stylish film</a> by&nbsp;first-time director Tom Ford, starring Colin Firth, and now about to&nbsp;be a ballet, premiering at this year’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://factoryinternational.org/whats-on/a-single-man/\">Manchester international festival</a>. Grant, the former Czars frontman and now an acclaimed solo&nbsp;artist (with albums including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/07/john-grant-pale-green-review\">Pale Green Ghosts</a> and his latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/14/john-grant-the-art-of-the-lie-review-grooving-funk-odyssey\">The&nbsp;Art of the Lie</a>), is writing the new&nbsp;show’s songs.</p> <p>A Single Man is the story of middle-aged academic George, an Englishman in LA, quietly living through devastating grief following the death of his partner, Jim, in a car&nbsp;accident. Reporting George’s thoughts in granular detail, the book&nbsp;charts, as&nbsp;Grant puts it, “the millions of tiny moments that make up human life”. The idea of turning the book into a&nbsp;ballet came from choreographer Jonathan Watkins (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/01/kes-review-jonathan-watkins-barry-hines-dance\">Kes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/07/northern-ballet-1984-review-west-yorkshire-playhouse-leeds\">1984</a>, Reasons to Stay Alive), who had been musing on the concept&nbsp;since before the pandemic. “Jonathan was pursuing me about this for several years, and I was a little&nbsp;confused about why anybody would want me to do it,” says Grant, though he says he’s always liked dance. Once Grant had read the book, it resonated so strongly there was no&nbsp;doubt. “It was like this man had been inside my head walking around. I&nbsp;mean, I knew I was self-absorbed,” he&nbsp;laughs, “but I didn’t realise there were people out there that understood me so deeply.”</p>    <p>The book’s portrayal of grief, especially, connected deeply with Grant, whose mother died of lung cancer when he was in his 20s. “My&nbsp;work is saturated by that. But&nbsp;sometimes I wonder if I’ve ever actually been able to grieve yet,” he&nbsp;says. “Grief is nothing if not an extremely skittish beast, right? The&nbsp;individual experience of dealing with grief is a very strange thing to go&nbsp;through. And it’s so masterfully depicted [in the book] within the context of going about your day.”</p> <p>When I speak to Watkins some days later, he too talks about the theme of grief, focusing on those experiencing it. “It’s also that there’s this great love between two men at a time when people didn’t really believe that two men could love each other that much, and therefore couldn’t feel grief in the same way,” he says. For Watkins, who founded the company Ballet Queer in 2023, the importance of A Single Man as a queer story was key to wanting to make this work. I ask why he was so keen to work with Grant, who is himself gay. “I always saw it with John Grant, I really loved his work and I&nbsp;could hear that the themes of his existing songs already had an overlap with the book. There’s a line in the song Glacier,” says Watkins. “It goes: ‘This pain is a glacier moving through you / And carving out deep valleys and creating spectacular landscapes …’ And for me, that was like the epilogue of our show!” Watkins says. “We use our experiences in life in order to forge&nbsp;forward. It was that lyric.”</p>    <p>In a north London dance studio that’s not quite big enough for all the bodies inside it, Watkins leads a rehearsal with dry humour and gentle authority. The dancers are trying to&nbsp;work out a musical cue. “We’re listening through, trying to find the ‘plink plonks’,” he tells them and they tilt their heads in concentration, waiting for the melody. Heading an&nbsp;accomplished cast of fascinating movers is ex-Royal Ballet principal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edward-watson\">Edward Watson</a>, who plays George. Watkins (who also danced with the Royal Ballet) had talked to him&nbsp;about the idea for A Single Man over the years, and when it finally crystallised into a project, “I realised that I wanted to do it – or I didn’t want anyone else to&nbsp;do it!” says Watson, a dancer of extraordinary physicality, known for bringing subtle angst and complexity to his roles. Next to him in&nbsp;the room is&nbsp;a contemporary dancer who excels in beautifully haunted characters, Jonathan Goddard, playing&nbsp;Jim, but&nbsp;also alternating in the&nbsp;lead for some performances.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People didn’t really believe that two men could love each other that much</p> <footer> <cite>Jonathan Watkins</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the dancers embody George’s physical life, Grant will be singing live on stage, expressing what’s going on inside George’s head. Watson loves dancing alongside singers on stage: he’s previously worked with Martha Wainwright, soprano Danielle de Niese and cabaret singer Meow Meow. “There’s something really special about being on stage with a singer. You can feel where the sound comes from; you’re not just listening to it, you share the space with where that emotion starts.”</p> <p>Once the dancers find their cue, they launch into a scene. Watkins’s choreography uses a lot of stark shapes and angular poses – you could map it on graph paper (“It’s like George is on autopilot, mechanically going through the motions,” Watkins says) – but then the movement might shift into something heavy, slinky, sexy, a little bit grimy. Characters have different signatures: for George’s friend Charley (played by Julianne Moore in the film, here by the Royal Ballet’s Kristen McNally) the movement is based in ecstatic dance. Elsewhere the dancers crowd into stylised formations, looking like a 21st-century Bob Fosse, while the prowling jazzy feel of the music evokes the 1960s.</p>    <p>Alongside Grant’s songs, the score has been created by composer Jasmin Kent Rodgman. She wanted the sound to be rooted in the 60s, acknowledging that it was a time of great musical experimentation, whether the pioneering Buchla synthesiser that she’s sampled for the score, or American minimalism or jazz. In the performance, each instrumentalist will be hooked up to an FX pedal so sounds can suddenly morph, she tells me, from “really lush romantic string trio … to open ambient, electronic anxiety, which might be slammed into this distorted trumpet line, that kicks us into a bit of high action”.</p> <p>Rodgman has relished working with Grant. “I have to say John is an incredibly generous creative. And he’s an incredibly accomplished musician,” she says. “Sometimes when you meet someone from the pop and rock world there’s a disconnect. But he’s a classically trained pianist. You can hear that; I hear Rachmaninov, Romantic piano music coming through. He used to play the baritone saxophone; there’s a lot of hidden facts about John Grant!”</p>    <p>When Grant talks about the songwriting process, he raves about the inspiration of Isherwood’s language. “It’s so masterful. It’s very uncontrived, you know. You don’t get the sense somebody is making a great effort to impress with their skills. It’s natural, organic. And the humour! Like I’m actually inside this human being experiencing these things.” That&nbsp;sounds much like a description of&nbsp;Grant himself, the ability to cut through life’s biggest emotions with&nbsp;the conversational and wryly observational (sample lyric from the&nbsp;song Sigourney Weaver, about a time of crisis in his childhood: “I feel just like Winona Ryder in that movie about vampires / And she couldn’t get that accent right / Neither could that other guy”).</p> <p>That ability to fuse the seismic and the mundane is apt to illustrate the dislocation of grief, when the world ends and carries on at the same time. As Watson puts it: “You can’t quite believe that all this is happening and then: oh, I still have to wash; I have to make dinner. It seems dumb to carry on with those things.”</p> <p>“No one is immune to grief,” says Watkins, which is what makes this story universal, but in his version as the story progresses, the gap between the inner and outer worlds, the mind and the body, begins&nbsp;to close. He talks of a scene at the end of the book where Isherwood describes some rock pools as being their own self-contained worlds. “He’s&nbsp;saying that we’re all in our own rock pools with all of our different characters and connections in our lives,” says Watkins. “And then the tide comes in and sweeps us into this one big shared ocean; we’re all part of&nbsp;this shared experience.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://factoryinternational.org/whats-on/a-single-man/\">A Single Man is at Aviva Studios, Manchester</a>, 2-6 July</em><em>; <a href=\"https://www.rbo.org.uk/tickets-and-events/a-single-man-jonathan-watkins-details\">Linbury theatre&nbsp;</a>at the Royal Opera House, London, 8-20 September.</em></p>",

She was asked whether known hanging points could be removed by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>“I certainly have raised it directly with my colleagues,” she told the ABC. “We are very serious, not just about this one issue of hanging points, Sally. We do not want to see further deaths in custody.”</p> \n<p>McCarthy was speaking shortly before a meeting of the joint council on Closing the Gap, which she said would discuss Aboriginal deaths in custody after the deaths of two men in police custody in the Northern Territory.</p> \n<p>“The gathering today of First Nations Indigenous affairs ministers … is testament to the fact that this is an incredibly important issue. And Australians need to see action, and this is what we’re doing.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Her comments follow public criticism of the inaction from the federal attorney general, Michelle Rowland, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/18/attorney-general-states-prison-ligature-hanging-points-review\">told the Guardian</a> this week that the ongoing death toll from known hanging points was unacceptable and “deeply concerning”.</p> \n<p>“The attorney general strongly encourages state and territory governments to review their practices and continue to work toward effective solutions that ensure the safety and dignity of all Australians in the justice system,” she said.</p> \n<p>The Indigenous leader and former senator Pat Dodson, who helped lead the 1991 royal commission, has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/17/patrick-dodson-condemns-decades-of-inaction-on-suicide-hanging-points-in-australian-prisons\">described the failures</a> as “totally unacceptable”.</p> \n<p>Later on Friday the Greens leader, Larissa Waters, called on the federal government to make Indigenous justice reform a priority of the 48th parliament.</p> \n<p>“It’s clear from the events of recent weeks that First Nations justice must be an urgent priority … the Greens are ready to work with Labor to get outcomes,” Waters said.</p> \n<p>“There have already been 13 Aboriginal deaths in custody this year. Recommendations from the 34 year old Deaths in Custody report remain unfulfilled, and opportunities to investigate structural racism in the justice system have been abandoned, but this parliament presents a real opportunity to take action.”</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia found deaths were continuing to occur from known hanging points in every jurisdiction in the country.</p> \n<p>In New South Wales, the Guardian found 20 hangings from ligature points that were known to authorities but not removed, including three from a set of bars in the Darcy unit of Silverwater prison in Sydney. One of those deaths was that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/10/astounding-negligence-revealed-governments-turn-blind-eye-to-staggering-prison-death-toll-hanging-points-ntwnfb\">Gavin Ellis</a>, who suffered a psychotic illness and was a known suicide risk, having attempted to hang himself twice in the first three days in custody.</p> \n<p>He was then not seen by a mental health clinician or reviewed by a psychiatrist for long periods before his death, and was sent into a cell with a ligature point that had been used by another inmate to hang himself two years earlier.</p> \n<p>A third inmate used the same hanging point after Ellis’s death. The state government will not say whether the bars have now been removed from Darcy unit cells.</p> \n<p>The toll in NSW also includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/12/tane-chatfield-hanging-points-deaths-prison-nsw-government-tamworth-ntwnfb\">2017 death of a young Indigenous man</a>, Tane Chatfield, who died by hanging at Tamworth prison. In his case, the coroner told the NSW government to audit the prison for additional hanging points. It did so but said it could find none to remove.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/12/tane-chatfield-hanging-points-deaths-prison-nsw-government-tamworth-ntwnfb\">Tane’s son still asks his grandmother: ‘How did my dad die?’ She doesn’t know what to say</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>An independent inspection of the prison less than 12 months later found “multiple” hanging points in Tamworth’s cells, including ones that had purportedly been removed.</p> \n<p>“When they said to us that they were going to deal with the hanging points … You think, ‘OK, so no other family’s going to go through this,’” his mother, Nioka Chatfield, told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>“It’s like they just pick your hopes up and they just shatter you.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian Australia investigation found 14 deaths from known hanging points in South Australia and seven in Western Australia.</p> \n<p>In Queensland, it identified 13 deaths from known hanging points, many of which were from a similar set of exposed bars to those used repeatedly at Arthur Gorrie prison.</p> \n<p>Deaths continued for years after the state government was told to “immediately” act to remove the bars, or make them inaccessible, at Borallon and Townsville prisons.</p> \n<p>The issue of hanging points is described by experts as a “proximate” issue in deaths in custody. Research suggests removing obvious hanging points is effective in reducing deaths but cannot be considered in isolation.</p> \n<p>The deaths investigated by the Guardian, like that of Ellis, often involved failures in providing mental health treatment and assessment, gaps in the broader mental health system, and problems with information sharing and cell placement.</p> \n<p><em>• In Australia, the crisis support service <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> is 13 11 14.

At the budget statement in March, the chancellor said she needed to cut the welfare bill to maintain a near-£10bn buffer in the current budget.</p> <p>Backbench Labour MPs are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/17/government-officials-brace-for-labour-mps-rebelling-against-welfare-bill\">expected to rebel</a> against cuts to benefits worth more than £5bn in the welfare bill introduced to parliament on Wednesday.</p> <p>Most economic forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England, have downgraded the UK’s growth prospects this year, potentially reducing tax receipts over the longer term and forcing the chancellor to make further spending cuts or raise taxes to bridge the gap.</p> <p>Pugh said tax increases would probably need to fill a deficit of up to £20bn based on lower OBR forecasts for growth.</p> <p>“We are pencilling in tax increases of £10bn-£20bn. The good news is that with interest rates likely to be about 4% at the time of the budget, there is plenty of scope for the Bank of England to cut rates to offset the impact of any fiscal consolidation on the economy.”</p> <p>Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “Last week’s spending review showed how we are investing in the UK’s security, health and the economy through our plan for change, so that people are better off.”</p>",

It’s the Edinburgh fringe, and he’s sitting through a one-woman standup show. “The solo performance artist, Hayley Sinclair, had a lot to say about the climate emergency, the patriarchy, and the looming end of the world, which was fair enough, but&nbsp;unfortunately her show was so terrible that, by half an hour in, Alex had decided that he actually wanted the world to end as soon as possible.”</p> <p>Instead, immediately after bashing out his one-star review, he goes to a&nbsp;bar, encounters an emotionally exhausted post-show Hayley, and invites her back to the flat he is sharing with another journalist, Sophie Ridgen. It is only the next morning that Hayley, after spending the night with Alex, reads the eviscerating, career-ending words he has written about her: “a&nbsp;dull, hectoring frump, like one of those 1950s cartoons of housewives beating their husbands with a rolling pin”. Alex blithely walks in from his morning shower to find Hayley with his brickbat in her hands.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Am I tempted to cast the first stone? Luckily, Runcie’s verbal wit, narrative chops and emotional subtlety make this impossible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a delightfully excruciating scene, setting in motion one of the most enjoyable novels I’ve read in a&nbsp;long time. Although as a male reviewer of a female artist, for a national newspaper, who by chance read much of the book on the train south from Edinburgh, I experienced moments of&nbsp;very meta-terror and mischief. Wouldn’t the most fun review to write, but even more to read, be an absolute slating? Wasn’t I, too, being tempted to&nbsp;cast the first stone?</p> <p>Luckily, Runcie’s verbal wit, narrative chops and emotional subtlety rendered that impossible. Alongside a fringe festival retelling of the history of the #MeToo movement, we also get a will-they-won’t-they plot and an inside account of so-Alex-has-been-publicly-shamed. Because, in reaction to her awful one-star review, and the one-night stand, Hayley transforms her one-woman show into&nbsp;“The Alex Lyons Experience” – a&nbsp;one-star review of Alex’s entire life and an immediate star-making media sensation. She retells the story of her encounter with Alex, then opens the stage for other women to share the appalling things Alex or other Alex-like men have done to them. And as&nbsp;clips from the show go viral, resonating far beyond a small function room below a pub and bringing forth similar stories from thousands of women, it starts to seem as though most men – all men? – are deserving of&nbsp;similar humiliation. And if not that,&nbsp;then a good digital stoning.</p> <p>As the Black Mirror episode Nosedive foretold, these days we are all but forced to participate in a culture of constantly rating one another. Midway through the novel, Sophie finds herself getting self-hatingly drunk at a festival party.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>There was an interactive customer feedback device propped up on the bar. Tell us what you think of our service, it&nbsp;said, and underneath there were two buttons you could press: an angry red face or a smiling green one. Excellent or worthless, nothing in between. Review your experience, share your thoughts, recommend us to your friends, swipe left, swipe right, leave a&nbsp;comment, have an opinion.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Everyone’s a critic. But shouldn’t we&nbsp;be more forgiving? Like Jesus. When he was born, his father only gave him&nbsp;one star.</p> <p>• Toby Litt is Head of Creative Writing at the University of Southampton.

            "body" : "<p>Every second summer more than 100,000 aviation industry professionals gather in Paris for an airshow – a flying display crossed with a vast conference. The mood at the latest gathering this week was more subdued than usual, after the deadly crash a week ago of a London-bound <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/12/london-bound-air-india-flight-ai171-plane-crash-people-onboard-ahmedabad\">Air India flight</a> in Ahmedabad.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/air-india-plane-crash-pilot-black-box-ai171-ahmedabad\">Investigators have recovered the black box</a> from the plane to try to work out the cause of the disaster. The aircraft maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/boeing-experts-uk-us-aviation-officials-join-air-india-crash-investigation-ahmedabad-flight-171-\">Boeing, and GE Aerospace</a>, which made the 787 Dreamliner’s engines, both cancelled many of their media-facing events out of respect for the families of the 241 passengers and crew who died, as well as at least 30 more people on the ground who were killed.</p> <p>At an event that presents a mix of civil and military aircraft and weaponry, the war between Israel and Iran further overshadowed proceedings.</p> <p>The French government forced the show’s organisers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/16/israeli-stands-paris-airshow-shut-down-french-government\">cover stands exhibiting Israeli companies’ weapons</a>, an apparent show of France’s opposition to the escalation. Turbo Sjogren, the head of Boeing’s international government and defence, said several Middle Eastern military customers were unable to attend meetings because of the war.</p> <p>The airshow and its British counterpart – held every other year at Farnborough, Hampshire – are usually dominated by a race between Airbus and Boeing to announce the most orders from airlines. </p> <p>Yet Boeing’s string of crises, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/boeing-culture-concealment-fatal-737-max-crashes-report\">two deadly crashes of the 737 Max</a> in 2018 and 2019, have meant that Airbus has taken the lead for several years. The Toulouse-headquartered plane maker announced 142 firm orders plus another 102 provisional orders at the show worth a cumulative $21bn (£15.5bn), according to Cirium Ascend, the aviation consultancy.</p> <p>That compared with zero orders announced by its US rival Boeing. Darren Hulst, a Boeing vice-president for commercial marketing, said: “Our hearts, our thoughts, our prayers are with all the families that have been impacted by this, as well as our partner and our long-term customer Air India.”</p> <p>Before an investigation shares its findings of the cause of the Air India crash, experts have mostly declined to make a judgment of what the longer-term consequences could be for Boeing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/19/flight-tax-climate-crisis-airline-tickets-levy-environment\">Flight tax could raise €100bn to tackle climate crisis, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet assessments of the state of the global aviation market suggest that demand for air travel will remain buoyant. Hulst predicted that 43,600 new planes will be needed through to 2044.</p> <p>“As we look to the end of this decade, by 2030, our industry will be about 45% larger than it was in the years before the pandemic,” he said.</p> <p>The majority of those deliveries will be “narrowbody” planes with a single aisle, such as Airbus’s A320 and the 737 family. Other companies are positioning to take advantage of that growth. Perhaps most notably, Britain’s Rolls-Royce, now a specialist in powering the biggest “widebody” planes, wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/rolls-royce-ready-to-rejoin-smaller-jet-engines-market-says-boss\">make engines for the much bigger narrowbody market</a>.</p> <p>Tufan Erginbilgic, Rolls-Royce’s chief executive, told reporters that the UK government should part-fund the development of the company’s next generation of jet engines, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/article/2024/aug/01/rolls-royce-turnaround-aircraft-engines-smr\">UltraFan</a>. In a direct pitch to the government, he argued that winning orders for narrowbody engines could create 40,000 jobs.</p> <p>“If you look at single-aisle, narrowbody entry could be the single biggest item for economic growth for UK, because it is that big. This is a huge market, right? A £1.6tn market.”</p> <p>Ahead of the UK’s industrial strategy, expected to be published on Monday, Erginbilgic argued that the government should target support at industries where the country is strongest, which he said included Rolls-Royce’s gas turbines and small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). </p> <p>Rolls-Royce’s part-owned subsidiary was chosen this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/rolls-royce-uk-small-nuclear-reactors-smr-sizewell-c\">to try to build the first UK SMRs</a>, with the first formal contract expected before October.</p> <p>“I believe any country needs to support competitively advantaged industries,” Erginbilgic said. “If you support competitively advantaged industries, your position in the market will be sustainable. Because it is already competitively advantaged. If you give some momentum, that will create lots of export growth, etc, and employment with that.”</p> <p>Rolls-Royce is also a key player in the UK’s defence strategy. Erginbilgic said the government’s recent strategic defence review and pledges to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP had “de-risked our key programmes”, all but guaranteeing demand for more nuclear reactors for attack submarines and engines for the future Tempest jet, officially known as the global combat air programme (GCAP), whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/13/uk-joins-italy-and-japan-to-develop-british-fighter-jet-to-rival-americas-f-35\">costs are shared between the UK, Italy and Japan</a>. Erginbilgic also said that the review’s emphasis on autonomous drones could mean future opportunities for Rolls-Royce to power them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/18/qantas-rebounds-from-worst-ever-performance-to-be-named-worlds-14th-best-airline-ntwnfb\">Qantas rebounds from worst-ever performance to be named world’s 14th best airline in ranking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK is not the only European country rearming in response to the perceived threat from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Yet the Paris airshow also revealed deep tensions in another key European weapons project: a rival “sixth-generation” fighter jet programme between France, Germany and Spain.</p> <p>Éric Trappier, chief executive of France’s Dassault, maker of the previous-generation Rafale jets that were on show in Paris, told Bloomberg TV that “we may go it alone” amid frustrations over who should lead. </p> <p>Michael Schoellhorn, chief executive of Airbus’s Germany-based defence division, said that political intervention might be needed to solve the dispute.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the European government consensus is that military spending must increase – particularly if the US under Donald Trump cannot be relied upon for support.</p> <p>Deals at the show included Rheinmetall teaming up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/29/move-fast-kill-things-the-tech-startups-trying-to-reinvent-defence-with-silicon-valley-values\">controversial US drones startup Anduril</a> to produce weapons in Germany, while Italy’s Leonardo formalised a joint drones venture with Turkey’s Baykar. With renewed war in the Middle East, defence bosses in Paris were keen to move quickly with manufacturing more lucrative weapons on European soil.</p>",
