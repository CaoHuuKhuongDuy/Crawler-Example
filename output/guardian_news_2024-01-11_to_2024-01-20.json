            "body" : "<p>Jeremy Hunt has compared himself to former tax-cutting chancellor Nigel Lawson, as he joined Rishi Sunak in teasing further potential cuts in the spring budget.</p> <p>Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the chancellor drew comparisons with the late Lawson, who was known for slashing personal taxation while serving in the Thatcher government.</p> <p>Hunt said: “Just as Nigel Lawson positioned the City of London for the finance boom in the 1980s, this period of Conservative government has seen the UK positioned for the massive technological boom we’re set to see in the coming years.”</p> <p>Lawson was appointed chancellor of the exchequer in 1983, delivering six budgets until his resignation in 1989. He began a tax-cutting process in 1986 that intended to cut the basic rate of income tax, initially from 30% to 29%. Two years later, the rate was cut to 25%.</p> <p>Hunt’s commitment to cutting taxes has been echoed by the prime minister, who promised to “always prioritise tax cuts to put more of people’s money back in their pockets”.</p> <p>Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Sunak said the government had been able to introduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/06/who-will-benefit-most-as-uk-national-insurance-cut-takes-effect\">a reduction in national insurance contributions</a> because his party had run the economy in a “disciplined way”.</p> <p>Hunt announced in November that the main rate of national insurance would be reduced from 12% to 10%, in a move the Treasury said represents “the largest ever cut to national insurance”.</p> <p>The policy took effect from 6 January, meaning 27 million workers should soon see an uplift. While heralded as a win, personal income tax thresholds remaining frozen until 2028 leave lingering doubts as to how beneficial this policy will be.</p> <p>Hunt has faced pressure to take action against this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/21/pressure-grows-on-hunt-to-cut-income-tax-as-millions-more-face-paying-it\">fiscal drag,</a> but has so far declined to do so.</p> <p>Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary, said: “Jeremy Hunt’s words will read hollow to the millions of people who have been left worse off after 14 years of economic failure.</p> <p>“Prices are still rising in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are soaring and the average family will be £1,200 worse off under the Tories’ tax plan.</p> <p>“Britain needs change and a Labour government, not five more years of Conservative failure.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When Rebecca Noecker first decided to enter politics in 2016, she was a young mother with two kids and many questions. She had a background in education but no knowledge of how to run for office.</p> <p>“There were so many systems that I saw around me that just felt broken and people were in pain and I wanted to do something about that,” Noecker, 39, said. “And it felt like politics was a way to do it.”</p> <p>She found a teacher in the only woman on her city council in St Paul, Minnesota.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/09/emergency-abortion-supreme-court-case-emtala-idaho\">Law protecting women seeking emergency abortions is target in US supreme court case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“She would walk around the lake with her constituents and called them ‘lake laps’. I went on a lake lap with her, and I was just so struck by how authentic and genuine she was,” Noecker said of her mentor, the former council member Amy Brendmoen.</p> <p>“She had three children and talked a lot about how despite the fact that you make sacrifices and you’re not necessarily home every night, your kids have this remarkable opportunity to see you in leadership and see what a difference you can make.”</p> <p>Today, Noecker, who represents the second ward, is St Paul’s longest serving member on the council. But she is far from the only woman.</p> <p>Last fall, all seven city council seats were up for grabs. On 7 November, after a campaign season packed with candidates, Minnesota’s capital city elected its new city council – comprised entirely of women. Last week marked the group’s inauguration.</p> <p>Noecker’s fellow council members – Nelsie Yang, Cheniqua Johnson, Hwa Jeong Kim, Saura Jost, Anika Bowie and Mitra Jalali – are all women of color and, like her, progressive in their politics. All council members are also under 40.</p> <p>The diversity of the group is something the newly elected council member Johnson,<strong> </strong>28, called “amazing and affirming”.</p> <p>“When you spend almost a year and a half working to earn your community’s trust during the cycle and vocalizing the community’s priority, you see – as the elections come in – that community heard you, they showed up and essentially, they want you to continue the work with them,” Johnson said. “It means voters elected who they wanted to see represent them. Many candidates ran and yet, our city said, ‘We want an all-woman city council.’”</p> <p>A 2023 Pew research <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/09/27/women-and-political-leadership-ahead-of-the-2024-election/\">report</a> on women leaders in US politics found that women’s representation in politics continues to grow across all forms of government including the US Senate, House of Representatives, state legislatures and governors.</p> <p>In 2019, Nevada became the first state with a majority-female state legislature. Today, women make up 62% of the Nevada state legislature – the largest percentage of any state.</p> <p>But experts have noted that no major city has achieved the feat of electing an all-female city council like St Paul.</p> <p>Notably, St Paul has a population of roughly 300,000 people, the second most populous city in the state after its fellow Twin city, Minneapolis. Approximately 46% identify as a race other than white, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/stpaulcityminnesota/PST045223\">US census</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This shouldn’t be an exceptional story, but a quiet normal that communities everywhere get to experience</p> <footer> <cite>Mitra Jalali</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jalali was also re-elected to the council and will now serve as its leader. Elected president in a unanimous vote, she said an all-female city council should be considered normal.</p> <p>“St Paul voters are showing the world what’s possible on city councils, county boards and local and state government everywhere,” Jalali, 37, said. “This shouldn’t be an exceptional story, but a quiet normal that communities everywhere get to experience.”</p> <p>Jalali is the first Iranian American to hold office in Minnesota and her résumé includes experience teaching and working for a fellow political pioneer, Keith Ellison, a former US house representative for Minnesota. He was the first Muslim elected to Congress and the first African American representative from the state.</p> <p>“I’m excited to lead our council forward with our community’s voices at the table,” Jalali said.</p> <p>Kelly Dittmar, director of research and scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP), said women’s representation in US politics is generally trending upward.</p> <p>“If you look across levels of office, we’re seeing pretty steady gains,” she told the Guardian. “Although for many years they were incremental, but they were still upward.”</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://cawp.rutgers.edu/news-media/press-releases/rethinking-womens-political-power\">a CAWP study</a> titled Rethinking Women’s Political Power, 192 political actors were interviewed within five states – Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania – “to examine both the state of and change in women’s political power from 2010 to 2023”.</p> <p>Several barriers to women’s political representation were discovered: women’s unequal access to monied networks in campaign fundraising, low salaries for public service jobs and political party influence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You’re seeing shifts in perceptions, both in the importance of having women in office, as well as women’s qualifications – things that historically have been more biased</p> <footer> <cite>Kelly Dittmar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“State-level and national mapping of existing organizations and programs shows that the support infrastructures for Democratic women in politics are more robust than those available to Republican women,” the report said. “This is true as well in our case states, where fewer gender-targeted resources are available to Republican women than their Democratic counterparts, even where Republicans hold statewide control.”</p> <p>While Dittmar pointed out that some of these barriers are easing, she said it’s also important to note that women are still underrepresented across different levels of office. It is uncommon for women to hold at least one third of offices at any level of government.</p> <p>“In the cases where we do see women make up either a majority, or in this case, all of a governing body, they are still very few and far between,” Dittmar said.</p> <p>Dittmar also credited, in part, societal changes that have allowed women to have a more noticeable presence in politics.</p> <p>“Beyond politics, there are [elements] that better situate women to run and win. Those are not only things on an individual level – where women have more access to positions of power across institutions, access to capital, and access to time outside the home due to a shift in expectations of gender roles – but also in the private and public spheres,” Dittmar said.</p> <p>“You’re seeing shifts in perceptions, both in the importance of having women in office, as well as women’s qualifications – things that historically have been more biased in ways that could really present significant hurdles to women. Voters may be more prone to think about the potential, value and capacity for women to hold political positions.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 January 2024. Keith Ellison was the first Muslim elected to Congress and the first African American representative from Minnesota, not Mitra Jalali, as an earlier version said. Also, the population of St Paul is roughly 300,000, not 30,000.</p>",

This time officers were sent. They forced entry to the house at about 7.15am and found the bodies of two young girls, a 45-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman.</p> <p>The force said on Saturday that it had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in relation to its failure to attend the first 999 call.</p> <p>It had already referred itself to the watchdog on Friday in relation to a separate matter linked to the case. Eleven days before Christmas, officers had been involved in a missing persons inquiry at the address in Costessey, near Norwich.</p> <p>The four found dead are yet to be formally identified, but the man has been named locally as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, a Polish engineer. He is understood to have lived at the address with the two children, thought to be his daughters. Police said the woman found dead with them was visiting and lived ­elsewhere. They are believed to have been members of the same family.</p> <p>DCI Chris Burgess, from the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, said: “Postmortem examinations will be carried out tomorrow for the man and woman, and on Wednesday for the two girls.</p> <p>“While I can confirm all four people were found with injuries, we will not be disclosing any further information until these examinations have taken place and the cause of death has been established.</p> <p>“This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved, and it is clear from the reaction it’s caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community. We’ve had uniformed officers patrolling the area today and these will continue tomorrow.”</p> <p>Police confirmed they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.</p> <p>This weekend, neighbours left flowers and cards outside the house while local churches opened so people could light candles and pray.</p> <p>Police were patrolling the area on Saturday with detectives carrying out house-to-house enquiries and reviewing CCTV. A cordon remained in place and forensic examinations were still under way.</p> <p>The police watchdog confirmed it had received a referral from Norfolk Constabulary “in relation to prior contact the force had at the address in Costessey, near Norwich, where four people were sadly found dead”. “We are assessing the available information to determine whether an investigation into that contact may be required and if so, who should conduct that investigation,” an IOPC spokesperson said.</p> <p>The force said the referral was made “following the identification of a 999 call made yesterday morning at 6am by a man at the address and police resources were not deployed”. The earlier referral was made “due to police contact at the address on 14 December which related to a missing person enquiry”.</p> <p>Post-mortem examinations to establish cause of death will be held in due course.</p>",

Centrelink last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/27/majority-of-centrelink-payments-facing-significant-delays-since-labor-took-office\">experienced a significant blowout</a> in wait times for claims in the middle of last year, though between September and December the average wait for jobseeker was reduced from 31 days to 24 days, data from Services Australia shows.

The latter, defined by sticky sweat and shortness of breath, is unbearable. But why?</p> <p>Here is everything you need to know.</p> <h2>What is humidity?</h2> <p>Very simply, humidity is water that has evaporated into the air.</p> <p>How humid it is can be observed by what is known as the “dew point” temperature – that is the temperature that is cold enough to make water condense, according to Prof Steven Sherwood from the University of NSW Climate Change Research Centre.</p> <p>The more moisture in the atmosphere – or the more humid it is – the higher that dew point will be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/18/threat-of-another-cyclone-looms-for-queensland-as-heavy-rain-continues-across-australias-north\">Threat of another cyclone looms for Queensland as heavy rain continues across Australia’s north</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside the dew point, relative humidity tells you how close the air is to saturation – that is, when the air holds as much water vapour as it can for a given temperature.</p> <p>Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air – so the relative humidity falls if the temperature rises but the amount of moisture in the air stays the same. The <a href=\"https://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/1324/feeling-hot-and-bothered-its-not-the-humidity-its-the-dew-point/#:~:text=Dew%20point%20is%20the%20temperature,greater%20the%20atmospheric%20moisture%20content.\">Bureau of Meteorology says</a> that “because of its direct relationship to fluctuating temperature”, relative humidity “doesn’t provide suitable guidance on how much moisture there is at a specific location”.</p> <p>Keeping that in mind, relative humidity has been falling in Australia because the land is warming faster than the ocean, Sherwood says.</p> <p>But that doesn’t mean we are seeing less vapour in the air. In fact, we are seeing more. Sea surface temperatures in the Coral and Tasman seas are up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/12/weather-forecast-heatwave-australia-sydney-queensland-western-australia\">3C above average</a> and winds over warming ocean waters bring higher humidity to our shores.</p> <p>So even though relative humidity is reducing, there is still more moisture and we feel like it is more humid.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>All this can be confusing, but the bureau’s <a href=\"https://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/1153/apparent-feels-like-temperature/\">“feels like” – or “apparent” temperature</a> can help – which takes into account wind and humidity and is listed in the “observations” section for the relevant location in Australia.</p> <p>It’s for this reason that “meteorologists prefer to use dew point when analysing atmospheric moisture and inferring what the conditions may feel like”, <a href=\"https://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/1324/feeling-hot-and-bothered-its-not-the-humidity-its-the-dew-point/#:~:text=Dew%20point%20is%20the%20temperature,greater%20the%20atmospheric%20moisture%20content.\">according to BoM</a>. This is represented by the “feels like” temperature.</p> <h2>Why is it so uncomfortable?</h2> <p>Humidity makes it harder for you to stay cool.</p> <p>Humans lose heat through heat transfer pathways that are driven by temperature differences between the skin and the surrounding environment, according to Prof Ollie Jay, the director of the University of Sydney Heat and Health Research Incubator.</p> <p>When it gets warm, those temperature differences become small – and the only other way we can lose heat is through producing sweat.</p> <p>But it isn’t sweat that cools us down, it is when sweat evaporates. Humidity in the air determines the driving force for that evaporation, Jay says.</p> <p>“If you have high humidity, you have to lose all this heat by evaporation of sweat, but not enough sweat can evaporate from the skin’s surface.”</p> <p>Your skin’s temperature will increase as a result – and that is what we perceive as being hot.</p> <p>“If you can’t evaporate that sweat to keep cool, then it induces discomfort,” Jay says.</p> <p>When it is humid, any activity can stimulate the feeling of being hot. “You will suddenly start sweating a lot and feeling very hot because high humidity is preventing your body’s air conditioning system from working,” Sherwood explains.</p> <p>“The hotter it gets and the harder you are working, the more important humidity becomes to how you feel, compared to temperature.”</p> <h2>A warning sign of the climate crisis?</h2> <p>Rising humidity is a threat from climate change that “hasn’t been appreciated by the public”, Sherwood says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/14/australia-weather-el-nino-rain-drought-impact-farming\">Doubt and flooding rains: how an unusual El Niño has affected Australian farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s no question that ocean temperatures are breaking records all over the world and they have been pretty steadily for decades … This is probably the clearest sign of climate change,” he says.</p> <p>As a result, the chances of getting really muggy weather in Australia have increased substantially, compared with what the chances would have been before, Sherwood says.</p> <p>How this will affect our health is “the thing we should be most worried about”, according to Jay.</p> <p>“The climate is warming, is going to have more absolute humidity, more water vapour and [it will be] increasingly more difficult to keep cool physiologically,” he says.</p> <p>“That induces a strain on your body. How much work your heart has to do, how dehydrated you become, how hot your core temperature gets – all of these different things that are a result of this stress increase our risk of a negative health event.”</p>",

It’s running or walking along its banks under the shady canopy of the jacaranda and poinciana trees of the West End, past the vibrant, human-made beach at South Bank, and around the winding, bustling paths at the base of the Kangaroo Point cliffs, where the whiff of mangroves reminds me of their place in the ecosystem, holding the banks in place.</p> <p>I run at daybreak in summer to beat the humidity, yet beads of sweat still form before I hit my first kilometre. And while anxiety often plagues me, the sky’s reflection in the glassy river offers tranquillity and calm in an otherwise turbulent world.</p> <p>The low hum of the CityCat cruising downriver towards the Go Between Bridge, trailing a frothy wake, competes with the morning calls of the birdlife along Maiwar. At least by January the swooping magpies are gone. There’s often a white ibis (AKA bin chicken) strutting about, and occasionally I’ll hear the high-pitched squawk of a rainbow lorikeet, a bird that carries me back to my family home in Sydney, and a photo of my late father smiling, feeding the lorikeets that drove the rest of us mad with their “talking”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories\">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>I have discovered Roma Street parkland as a place to run. It’s a wondrous 11-hectare oasis in the heart of the city, described as a “horticultural masterpiece” and known as the world’s largest tropical garden in a city. It’s no wonder Darryl Jones, urban ecologist and author of Getting to Know the Birds in your Neighbourhood, says Brisbane is the most biodiverse city in Australia.</p> <p>At Christmas, the parkland celebrated with an “Enchanted Garden” light show, and a moonlight cinema runs till early February (who doesn’t love a movie picnic?). But every day of the year the parkland is home to spiny water dragons that test your footwork while you run. Some scatter on approach, while others bravely own the footpath, forcing you to detour around them.<strong> </strong>The spectacle garden is an ever-changing cascade of colour and the rainforest walk fools you with its temperature and humidity.</p> <p>I fulfil Wiradyuri tradition when I walk through the parkland by tree-hugging with purpose. Each hug aims to leave some love behind, so passersby can hug the trunk back and absorb the love left there. Tip: there’s quite a bit of my love left along Banyan Lawn.</p> <p>When I moved to Brisbane at the end of 2015, it was many months before my friends stopped asking when I would return “home”. Without saying I didn’t miss Sydney, which was true, I kept my response simple: “Brisbane is my home now.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The landscape, the ecosystem, the light all capture the senses of many Brisbane writers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I read Sally Piper’s novel Bone Memories<em>,</em> I saw some of my reasonings in the line: “This place had all the goings-on of another kind of city, pulsing with as much activity as the one she’d left behind.”</p> <p>That activity was certainly in the arts but also in the weather patterns that were so new and extreme to me. I remember the fierceness of the first electrical storm the summer I arrived; was amused by colleagues analysing the BoM site on their work computers, calculating how much time they had to get safely home. The devastating effects of floods aside, I am still mesmerised by lightning flashing across a green-grey sky, and the often sideways rain during Brisbane’s tropical summer storms. As I write, the rain has been falling gently for almost 24 hours. On New Year’s Day I strolled around my new ’hood soaking up the rain and the scent of freshly cleansed streets. Brisbane in summer is also renewal and growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/06/wed-come-here-to-get-away-from-bickering-about-screens-but-had-plunged-back-further-to-the-eocene\">‘We’d come here to get away from bickering about screens but had plunged back further: to the Eocene’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The colours of Brisbane’s sky are as changeable as the flowers in the spectacle garden. At full sun I feel my own light shine from within; positivity that does not always appear on cloudy days. At dusk, riding the CityCat from work at St Lucia is truly magical; it reflects Maiwar and this city at its best.</p> <p>The landscape, the ecosystem, the light all capture the senses of many Brisbane writers. The Australian writer and journalist Matthew Condon writes about light in his nonfiction work Brisbane:</p> <blockquote> <p>I keep coming back to the light of Brisbane. If you are born into it, this palette of gentle pinks and oranges at dawn and dusk, the blast white of midday in summer, the lemon luminescence of mid-morning and mid-afternoon, you keep it with you, and measure all other light by it.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wasn’t born into the light that Matt writes about but that light stays with me when I am not here. It is difficult not to compare all other places with this jewel of a city and the way it makes me feel when Maiwar is at my side and its paths are beneath my feet.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dr Anita Heiss is an avid runner and author of Tiddas, a love letter to Brisbane</p></li> </ul>",

They’re our totem as well.

All four had attacked people – tourists to one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland\">Queensland’s</a> most popular natural getaways.</p> <p>The 200 or so wongari living on K’gari are among the most genetically pure dingoes in the world and every player in the management of the island wants to avoid destroying them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/17/kgari-dingo-attack-woman-hospitalised-queensland\">Between 2020 and 2023</a> there were no animals put down at all, after the implementation of a new safety and management strategy by the state government.</p> <p>But despite the safety crackdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/23/kgari-dingo-attack-tourists\">K’gari dingo attacks</a> continue to be frequent. Environmental groups and the local Aboriginal corporation say it’s time for a new approach: a cap on people.</p>    <p>Peter Shooter, past president of the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation and a member of the K’gari world heritage advisory committee, said the death of even a handful of dingoes would have an effect on the shallow gene pool on the isolated island.</p> <p>He said a genetic study by Southern Cross and Johannesburg universities revealed a lack of genetic diversity was “a potential risk for the population”.</p> <p>“There is no immediate risk. But in the long term it is always a risk when you get populations down to the sizes the wongari on K’gari are.”</p> <h2>Are people the problem?</h2> <p>A spokesperson for Queensland’s environment department said the latest dingo to be destroyed had attacked two children and a man in three separate incidents, all in the Hook Point barge landing area, one of the busiest spots on the island.</p> <p>They said euthanasia was a last resort, but “due to the escalation of the animal’s behaviour” the decision was made to euthanise the dingo. The Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation, the island’s native title holders, do not support euthanasia.</p> <p>It’s not a new story. According to the department, there have been six dingo-related incidents on K’gari since 10 December, half of them involving children.</p> <p>But it is people who are perceived as the real menace on K’gari by those who care for the land.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These things are not pets. You wouldn’t you wouldn’t want to cuddle a lion cub</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rangers have already issued two fines in 2024 for leaving food out for dingoes. This is an offence because feeding is among the leading causes of “habituation”, which is the process by which an animal, even a naturally shy one like a wongari, becomes comfortable being around people.</p> <p>Feeding is a particular problem because the animals learn to associate humans with an easy meal rather than as a threat. The dingoes have no natural predators, so people are the major risk to their life, Shooter says.</p> <p>The solution: keeping people away from animals.</p> <p>The government has tried everything: fencing human areas, signs warning of the fatal consequences of habituation for both human and animal, stepped-up patrols and more.</p> <p>But Shooter says he’s seen a steady deterioration in people’s behaviour after the Covid period.</p> <p>Tour groups tend to be well behaved but independent travellers sometimes outright ignore the rules, he says.</p> <p>“Getting selfies, getting as close as possible,” he says. “They are cute animals, the little fellas particularly, they’re gorgeous. It is kind of human nature to want to get as close as possible to them and cuddle them because that’s what we do with our pets.</p> <p>“These things are not pets. You wouldn’t you wouldn’t want to cuddle a lion cub … not out in their natural range.”</p>    <p>Shooter and the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation are among many groups who believe it’s time to strengthen restrictions on tourists.</p> <p>That might mean a process of banning the worst-behaved individuals from the island, or simple population caps at peak periods, such as those on Lord Howe Island, Antarctica and Machu Picchu.</p> <p>John Green, a project coordinator at the Aboriginal corporation, has also worked as a ranger on K’gari for more than a decade.</p> <p>“Capping the numbers for the peak periods would be an idea, because then the resources required to educate and have these opportunities happen is minimised,” he says.</p> <p>“The sheer numbers do make it harder to be everywhere.”</p> <p>He says such a cap could be balanced by more visitors outside the peak periods, with tourists spread over the quieter months rather than concentrated during the school holidays.</p> <p>“That’s where these wongaris don’t get a chance … purely from the sheer numbers in those peak periods.”</p> <p>Shooter points out that the idea may not be popular among everyone.</p> <p>The Fraser Coast region gets more than half a million tourists a year, almost all domestic and many of them bound for K’gari. It’s a large and important industry.</p> <p>But Shooters says as a result of the number of visitors the island’s “social fabric has changed”.</p> <p>“We have caused it to change,” Shooter says. “It’s most unfair to think, well, the response to that is for, us who caused the change, to decide we will just kill the animals. That’s totally unacceptable.”</p> <p>The immediate solution is more money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/29/research-suggests-that-more-than-half-of-australias-dingoes-are-genetically-pure-not-hybrids\">Research suggests that more than half of Australia’s dingoes are genetically pure, not hybrids</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a statement, the department said it was investing an additional $2m this year plus $3m annually to expand safety messaging further and to support 13 new positions dedicated to dingo conservation and management.</p> <p>The Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation is hoping to hire as many as four wongari rangers to deal solely with the animals, adding to seven or eight existing rangers.</p> <p>Green says their role would be as much about managing people as the environment – keeping an eye on both groups, which is easier if there are fewer people.</p> <p>“Our purpose would be to try to focus on the ones that are heading down that road [of habituation] and give them a chance to stay away from the visitors,” he says.</p> <p>Shooter says it is humans who are the problem – even though animals pay the ultimate price.

            "body" : "<p>England are jetting out to the Costa Brava this coming week but winter sun is only a small part of the package. While Steve Borthwick wants his players to spend some time relaxing away from their well-appointed training base of Girona, currently top of La Liga, he is also keen to ensure they are good and ready for the specific demands of a modern Six Nations Championship.</p> <p>Borthwick, as he loves doing, has been digging into the stats and, before a ball is box-kicked, reckons he knows where the championship will be won and lost. Spoiler alert: it will not be all about flowing back play or individual wizardry. According to England’s head coach, the key areas will be the breakdown and the scrum, mirroring the knockout stages of the recent World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/19/steve-borthwick-says-english-rugby-has-turned-a-corner-but-has-it-really\">Steve Borthwick says English rugby has turned a corner, but has it really?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England are not due to meet their two strongest opponents, Ireland and France, until the final two rounds in March but Borthwick will still be prepping his squad for an immediate step change from their weekly Premiership diet. While the pace and standard of the domestic league may be rising, Test rugby remains another ball game entirely.</p> <p>Part of the reason, in Borthwick’s view, is the way major tournaments are officiated. “The breakdown and the scrum are refereed differently in international rugby. When you start looking at the Six Nations there is no competition in world rugby that has a higher turnover rate at the breakdown.</p> <p>“With English referees in the Premiership, the speed of ball is high and the players want the ball out of the breakdown. The area around the maul is also clean and is not heavily penalised. In Test rugby that’s different. That area is not as clean. You see so many good back-rowers in the Six Nations and that means the breakdown is a real contest. Look at the Irish, French and Scottish back-rows. They are top quality.”</p> <p>As South Africa further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/22/south-africa-relief-england-rugby-union-world-cup\">underlined in the World Cup semi-final</a>, the scrum also remains a different beast to anything that exists domestically. “As we found to our cost in the World Cup semi-final, the scrum is a contest. Teams having the opportunity to scrum for penalties is important. In the Premiership too many scrums are not getting to a contest. I like a scrum contest, I don’t want that leaving our game.”</p> <p>It is another reason why Borthwick can foresee a series of tight Six Nations games, shaped at close quarters with defensive excellence also pivotal. “As soon as you go up the levels the standard of defence is heightened. Across international rugby fewer tackles are being missed and the players are getting fitter. And you can bring eight subs on to the pitch, which means there is less space available in the second half. It’s getting harder and harder.”</p>    <p>Hence teams’ reluctance to play too much rugby in the middle third of the field and the importance of a good kicking game. Entertainment can be subjective but the sport cannot afford the balance to tilt too far into risk-free conservatism. Borthwick is among those who would back a reduction in the number of permitted bench replacements from the present eight.</p> <p>“There’s a bigger discussion to be had about the nature of the game. But what we’re seeing now is less space. To create more of it we need to have some level of fatigue in what we do. There are different areas you could tweak but one is the number of replacements. That will impact the amount of fatigue in the game and generate some space.”</p> <p>For now, though, England need high work rate players who are also good over the ball. Sam Underhill and Ben Earl both fit that description, as does the returning reserve hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie, who missed the World Cup through injury. A complementary centre pairing will also be important. If it is decided not to deploy Ollie Lawrence at 12, Northampton’s uncapped Fraser Dingwall could come into the equation and be invited to show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/19/steve-borthwick-says-english-rugby-has-turned-a-corner-but-has-it-really\">Premiership form can translate to the Test arena</a>.</p> <p>Borthwick, either way, is cautiously optimistic that a slimmed-down, 10-team Premiership is now producing more of the taut, competitive contests that can help prepare players for the highest level. “There’s no doubt the density of the talent has increased in a number of teams. Whilst we may not have wanted it to have happened in the manner it happened, I think the standard has improved. That’s led to a more competitive Premiership and that’s good for our game.</p> <p>“The closeness of the games is important. Test rugby is so tight and if we’re playing games where the scoreline is blown out, it is not preparing players for what we need to do. Teams are having to find ways to win these tight games. That breeds a mental intensity that wasn’t always there. We all know the mental intensity required in the Six Nations is incredible.”</p> <p>When England relocate to Spain on Tuesday it will be for business rather than pleasure.</p>",

The Forest manager said: “The law is clear – every situation that leads to a goal must be checked. It’s not even a matter of inches, it’s almost a&nbsp;yard.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/20/brentford-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">Maupay floors Nottingham Forest after Ivan Toney scores on Brentford return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toney was adamant he was within his rights. “You have a yard either way so I moved it a bit round the corner,” he said. “I saw the gap. Sometimes you have a gap either way and I bent the ball around the wall and was so happy to see it go in. I practise every day in training. Everyone banters me when it goes in the stands or the car park but when it mattered I delivered so it’s&nbsp;good.”</p> <p>When told of Toney’s claim that you are allowed to move the ball, Nuno said: “That’s a new one on&nbsp;me.”</p> <p>The goal was Toney’s fourth in four league appearances against Nottingham Forest and came in the 19th minute after Danilo had given Nuno’s side an early lead in west London, before goals from Ben Mee and Neal Maupay sealed a crucial first win since the start of December for Brentford. The 28-year-old Toney lasted the entire match despite not having played competitively since May and said he had predicted his successful return during his long spell on the sidelines.</p>    <p>“It was a long time coming,” said Toney. “I manifested this win when I was at home during the time I was out, I am here now and buzzing to be back scoring goals and winning with the team. I 100% knew this would happen again. I manifest things like this. Before the game, before I left my house, I thought: ‘We’re winning today and I’m scoring.’ And I made it happen, which is&nbsp;good.”</p> <p>Brentford’s manager, Thomas Frank, was full of praise for his players after they battled back from a goal down to leapfrog their opponents in the table. “He’s a clever player,” he said of Toney. “And he took his chance very well.

            "body" : "<p>The post-Get Out influx of “elevated” horror films, more focused on the construction of a smug metaphor than coherence or cohesion, has become a blight on an already blighted genre. It’s an incredibly difficult web to weave – even Jordan Peele himself facing the odd stumble since his ground-shifting breakout – yet still so many keep trying in dissertations clumsily disguised as films.</p> <p>But in I Saw the TV Glow, a buzzy, brilliant new film premiering at the Sundance film festival, the writer-director Jane Schoenbrun has made it all look so easy, crafting something loaded with meaning yet light on its feet, provoking us to discussion and debate while never feeling like an academic exercise – a movie that never forgets that it’s, well, a movie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/20/the-outrun-review-saoirse-ronan-is-remarkable-in-a-sensitive-recovery-drama\">The Outrun review – Saoirse Ronan is remarkable in a sensitive recovery drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What makes their film doubly remarkable is that it’s also about relatively recent nostalgia, another tiresome pitfall for many as small and big screens are consumed by pop culture references thrown at us without thought or care, offering recognition for recognition’s sake. I Saw the TV Glow, mostly set in the 90s and early 00s, is far sharper than that. Schoenbrun avoids the mistakes others have made by audaciously creating their own, utterly believable media landscape (original songs from Phoebe Bridgers and Caroline Polachek feel perfectly of the time without being pastiche-y) while realising that nostalgia can be a corrosive force. Their film isn’t a simple indictment of fandom – Schoenbrun is aware of how overwhelming and affirming it can feel to truly love a piece of culture – but it’s also aware of the problems such obsession can bring, when it goes from being your something to being your everything.</p> <p>We first glimpse this something on the TV set of 12-year-old Owen (excellently played by Let the Right One In’s Ian Foreman). He sees a commercial for a teen fantasy show called The Pink Opaque and is transfixed by the Buffy-esque monster-of-the-week horror that’s just out of his reach (it airs past his bedtime on Saturday nights). When he encounters the ninth-grader Maddy (Atypical’s Brigette Lundy-Paine) reading an episode guide for the show, the two begin a tentative, awkward friendship, Owen lying about sleepovers with another friend in order to watch episodes with Maddy. As the years go on, a slightly older Owen (played from 14 upwards by Justice Smith, a big ask that pays off) and Maddy barely speak, their communication limited to recorded episodes left on videotapes. Both are uncomfortable with a life lived outside of the small-screen universe they have become consumed with. When the show is cancelled, things start to fracture, and years later, when the pair see each other as twentysomethings, they start to question the nature of their reality.</p> <p>I wasn’t always convinced by Schoenbrun’s lauded debut, the lo-fi internet body horror We’re All Going to the World’s Fair – an intriguing if incomplete mood piece – but I was impressed by their ability to conjure a moment of deep-in-your-stomach creepiness, understated yet often overwhelming, the kind that sticks with you for longer than you might like. I Saw the TV Glow marks a remarkable progression for Schoenbrun as both writer and director, a more substantive, if still challenging, narrative married with an incredible, expanded ability to fully immerse us in the visuals they have created. It’s made with such transportive precision that I can still feel it as I write – an atmosphere so intoxicating, it feels less like the creation of a movie and more of an entire world, a scary and sad place more familiar to some of us than to others.</p> <p>Our ability to escape into a fictional construct becomes harder with age, not just because of how we change and close down as people but because of shifts in how we consume entertainment. Schoenbrun understands the thrill and reward of the journey we used to take with physical media, the hurdles we had to face and how much investment we had in what we could amass. There’s a poignant little scene when Owen, as an adult, finds that his once prized show is now easily available to stream, all there with a click, but it looks different, feels different, and suddenly he’s embarrassed: did I dream this? Was any of it real?</p> <p>What the film is ultimately about, the uncomfortable places it ends up taking us, will likely be pored over with the same kind of rabid obsessiveness that the characters have for their favourite show. It’s about loneliness and fandom and maybe what it’s like to deal with mental illness or be close to someone with that struggle, to see someone losing their grip and the pain that brings. But it’s also a story about what it’s like to be queer or trans, Schoenbrun using both characters to show the devastation of a life unlived in a way that recalls the more unsettling elements of Andrew Haigh’s heart-crushing drama All of Us Strangers. Schoenbrun, a nonbinary and trans artist, has found a way to cleverly and subtly involve us in an experience often flattened or made digestible for the masses. The last act is an imperfect folly, pushing us a little too far in places, but when we’re pulled back, it’s with an almighty gut-punch, a howl of sadness that’s still ringing in my ears. I Saw the TV Glow is a puzzle with pieces missing and like many who soon experience it, I’ll be haunted trying to find them.</p> <ul> <li><p>I Saw the TV Glow is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year</p></li> </ul>",

We sort ’em out at every level. But after the primary’s over, you vote pro-life,” the former Republican vice-president to Trump told a downtown Washington DC ballroom of young, diehard anti-abortion activists on Saturday. “You go get behind men and women who are going to stand for the right to life.”</p> <p>The room erupted into applause.</p> <p>The activists had gathered in the ballroom for the National Pro-Life Summit, the conclusion of a two-day extravaganza of anti-abortion activism in the US capital. On Friday, many had walked through the snowy streets of Washington to support the March for Life, the largest annual anti-abortion event in the United States.</p> <p>But while the March for Life is a mass show of force, the National Pro-Life Summit is far more focused. It aims to arm the foot soldiers of the anti-abortion movement, high school- and college-aged activists, with the education and energy they need to effectively advocate against abortion rights – especially in an election year.</p> <p>In the months since the US supreme court overturned Roe, abortion rights supporters have repeatedly defeated abortion foes in ballot referendums, even in conservative strongholds such as Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio.</p> <p>This string of losses, though, has seemingly hardened the stance of summit attendees and speakers. Rather than compromising, summit speakers urged young people: don’t give up. Do more.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to see no abortions be legal, ever</p> <footer> <cite>Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“We need to be bolder. We need to be louder,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, the organization behind the Pro-Life Summit, said. “We’re working in 10 to 17 states this year, introducing various pro-life laws, doing as much as we can to save as many lives. So I want to see no abortions be legal, ever.”</p> <p>In the morning, summit attendees gathered in a massive ballroom lit in shades of purple, purple and pink. Speakers spoke against a teal backdrop emblazoned with logos for groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defending Freedom, two powerful organizations that are spearheading much of the conservative political and legal charge against causes like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.</p> <p>The speakers’ talks portrayed the abortion foes in the room as the descendants of freedom fighters such as soldiers in the US revolutionary war and the second world war. The historical analogies did not stop there: they also drew comparisons between abortion, the Holocaust and the 7 October attack in Israel.</p> <p>The fight against abortion, they suggested, was no less than righteous spiritual warfare.</p> <p>“Make no mistake: this idea of human inequality, that some people count and some people don’t, doesn’t come from the media, or the government, or the elite, or even Planned Parenthood,” said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation. “It comes straight from hell.”</p> <p>Attendees cheered wildly – even more than they had for Pence’s remarks.</p> <p>This weekend marked a kind of official kick-off around abortion organizing, for both sides of the aisle, since the would-be 51st anniversary of Roe is on Monday. While anti-abortion activists amassed in Washington, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have announced that they are launching a new blitz of ads and events to spotlight the impact of Roe’s demise.</p> <p>That strategy seems well placed. Polling in the US still suggests strong support for a legal right to abortion, despite an intense wave of crackdowns and restrictions by Republican-run state legislatures. That also has translated at the ballot box, where Republican losses in the 2022 midterms and Virginia’s elections last year were partly blamed on anger over Republican extremism on abortion.</p> <p>But if Democrats are hoping that outrage over Roe will lead them to victory in the 2024 elections, abortion opponents remain equally as determined to stay strong.</p> <p>“In every struggle between good and evil, we know the enemy’s outrage can be wielded as a powerful weapon. However, the key to victory always lies in those who persist,” Hawkins told attendees in a speech, a cross swinging from glittery beads looped around her neck. “And that’s what those on the other side just don’t understand about us. That we will never go away.”</p>",

He once mocked Rafa Benítez for winning the Europa League; now he celebrates winning the Conference League and was angered enough by not winning the Europa League last season that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/02/jose-mourinho-facing-touchline-ban-after-referee-abuse-draws-uefa-charge\">he waited for the referee Anthony Taylor</a> in the car park after the final.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/16/roma-run-out-of-patience-after-riding-the-jose-mourinho-hurricane\">Roma run out of patience after riding the José Mourinho hurricane | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mourinho is diminished and yet there remains something irresistible about him. Within hours of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/16/roma-run-out-of-patience-after-riding-the-jose-mourinho-hurricane\">sacking by Roma on Tuesday,</a> stories were appearing insisting that Newcastle have absolutely no intention of appointing him. (To be clear, that is Newcastle responding to queries rather than making a proactive statement, but still, it was revealing just how many journalists and social media commenters alike made the link.) Why would a club backed by the vast wealth of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, looking up hopefully from the foothills of greatness, appoint a coach who has not been at the pinnacle of his profession for a decade? And yet, and yet …</p> <p>Most fans may still back Eddie Howe despite poor form. The sporting director, Dan Ashworth, may favour somebody closer to the tactical vanguard rather than a coach whose glories lie in the age of attrition that preceded the <em>guardiolista</em> revolution.</p> <p>But who actually makes the decisions? Because Newcastle have not had to make a managerial change since Howe replaced Steve Bruce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/20/steve-bruce-was-out-of-his-depth-in-dream-job-at-newcastle\">after his inevitable dismissal</a> in October 2021 nobody knows exactly who is making these calls. Mourinho’s aura was enough to seduce even a chairman as experienced as Tottenham’s Daniel Levy in 2019; would it be so surprising if he caught the eye of Yasir al-Rumayyan or some other Saudi executive, particularly given his position <a href=\"https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/634629/SAUDI-ARABIA/Jose-Mourinho-among-board-members-of-Mahd-Sports-Academy-approved-by-Saudi-Crown-Prince\">as a board member</a> at the Mahd Sports Academy in Jeddah, alongside the influential Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud and the assistant sports minister?</p> <p>Besides, there is something about Mourinho to Newcastle that feels right and not just because, three years ago, he described himself as “a little Magpie” having heard tales of the club and the passion of its fans at the knee of Bobby Robson. Mourinho’s greatest successes at Porto, Chelsea and Internazionale have come with clubs that could portray themselves as rebel outsiders, battling the establishment. That is exactly how Newcastle’s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/11/newcastle-may-have-to-sell-key-player-in-summer-after-73m-loss\">Darren Eales, portrayed the club</a> – poor benighted Newcastle, cursed with the richest owners in the world – as he explained last week how constrained the club is by profit and sustainability rules.</p>    <p>Since the PIF takeover Newcastle seem to have embraced the dark side; the paranoid fervour of some of their more vocal fans, those who see every concern about human rights abuses, or states buying titles, as motivated by club loyalties or a global conspiracy to repress the geordie people, would seem fertile ground for the classic Mourinho pouting and whining. The coincidence of Mourinho losing his job just as Newcastle have lost six of their last seven league matches is almost too perfect.</p> <p>But failing Newcastle – and it should be stressed that the club are adamant Howe’s job is not at risk – where does Mourinho go next? He has made little secret of the fact that he sees himself managing Portugal at some point, but that job is not going to be available before the Euros at the earliest: Roberto Martínez’s 10 games in charge have brought 10 wins and an aggregate goal difference of 36-2.</p> <p>What clubs would take him? A third stint at Chelsea, just to confirm their status under Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali as the greatest example yet of football club as banter project? A climactic bonfire of the vanities at Paris Saint-Germain? A triumphant return to Barcelona, Joan Laporta making the appointment he didn’t make in 2008 when he opted instead for Pep Guardiola, to salt the turf that brought the world 15 years of hegemonic <em>juego de posición</em>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/19/bayern-munich-keen-on-newcastle-kieran-trippier-in-possible-swap-deal-transfer\">Bayern Munich keen on Newcastle’s Kieran Trippier in possible swap deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem is, there’s almost no option that doesn’t sound instantly hilarious, the sort of thing you want to see but would hate to happen at your own club. Roma was a little different from other recent jobs given how popular Mourinho remained with fans to the last, how relatively limited the toxicity, but it still conformed to the familiar pattern: the fillip of his arrival and an immediate uplift perhaps bringing early success, then growing friction with the squad and/or directors as results deteriorate before the final meltdown.</p> <p>With each job, the highs become a little lower. Scrapping for sixth place in Serie A and hailing it as a triumph given the lack of resources feels unbecoming for a manager who once strove with the gods. </p> <p>So where next? Mourinho doesn’t need the money; a recent study ranked him as the wealthiest coach in the world with a <a href=\"https://www.gamblingzone.com/uk/the-zone/sports/most-successful-sports-coaches/\">net worth of almost £100m</a>. Rather, he seems driven by resentments and the need to prove he was right to reject the Barcelona principles when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/22/devil-and-jose-mourinho\">the club turned him down in 2008</a>, to turn his back on pressing and possession to adopt an approach of radical reactivity.</p> <p>But to do that, to pull off one last grand triumph, he needs his stage. The clubs that may attract him, the clubs who can afford him, probably do not want him. Logic suggests a stint in the Saudi Pro League but the narrative of the Premier League’s grand soap opera demands the Little Magpie fly to St James’ to do one final job for Sir Bobby.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>One can only imagine the feelings that ran through Jürgen Klopp when, as is likely, he sat down and watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/13/newcastle-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City’s victory at Newcastle</a> last Saturday. There may well have been a thrill at taking in arguably the best game of the season but also, no doubt, a sense of deja vu in seeing City triumph in such impressive, relentless style.</p> <p>A lot of teams have been tormented by City’s state-funded brilliance under Pep Guardiola but few have felt the pain quite like Liverpool, especially during the 2018-19 and 2021-22 campaigns when they accumulated huge points totals – 97 and 92 respectively – but still could not beat the men from Eastlands to the title. In the one season they did prevail, 2019-20, Covid struck, making the moment Liverpool finally got their hands on the trophy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/15/liverpool-to-lift-premier-league-trophy-on-the-kop-chelsea\" title=\"\">an odd and eerie one</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/jan/19/premier-league-and-beyond-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League and beyond: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still it was a title win, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/25/how-liverpool-became-premier-league-champions\" title=\"\">ending 30 years of hurt</a>, and for Liverpool there is the chance to be champions again. They return from their winter break for a trip to Bournemouth on Sunday afternoon top of the Premier League with less than half of the campaign remaining. Their eyes are on the prize, but there lurks a large concern – City sit two points behind them in second having won their past six games in all competitions and have Kevin De Bruyne back from injury with Erling Haaland poised to return soon. It all looks very ominous for Klopp and his men.</p> <p>It does not help Liverpool’s cause that they are simply not as good now as they were in those previous years they battled City for the title. That is hardly a criticism, however, given the standards set back then, and it is credit to all involved that they find themselves in mid-January not only in a position to win the title but also three other trophies given the wretchedness of last season. The Klopp era was meant to be done but instead the German renewed his squad in regards to personnel, hunger and focus, and set the train in motion all over again. And they have been like a train – winning 13 of their 20 league fixtures so far this season and losing only one, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/03/pgmol-prepared-to-send-liverpool-audio-relating-to-luis-diaz-gaffe-at-spurs\" title=\"\">that</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/03/pgmol-prepared-to-send-liverpool-audio-relating-to-luis-diaz-gaffe-at-spurs\" title=\"\"> game away at Tottenham</a>.</p> <p>Key to Liverpool’s success has been the contributions of the four players who make up their spine: Alisson, Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah. All members of the 2019-20 title-winning side, they have allied top-level experience with top-level performances. Salah has been the standout, scoring 18 goals and providing nine assists in 27 appearances in all competitions. His absence owing to Africa Cup of Nations duty is a blow for Liverpool and one that could get worse given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/18/africa-cup-of-nations-afcon-equatorial-guinea-ivory-coast-nigeria-egypt-ghana\" title=\"\">hamstring injury he suffered</a> while playing for Egypt against Ghana on Thursday. “It was a shock,” said Klopp the following morning. “He felt it and we all know how rarely Mo goes off, so it’s definitely something.” Liverpool received good news on this front on Friday evening when the Egyptian Football Association announced Salah is only likely to miss his country’s next two games, and the last-16 tie should they progress that far.</p> <p>Alexander-Arnold is also out with a knee injury, although he is expected to return soon and, all going well, the 25-year-old will continue to be the creative heartbeat of the side with his sensational passing capabilities from a hybrid full-back/midfield position. Van Dijk, meanwhile, is back to being a centre-back colossus while Alisson continues to do Alisson things. Quite simply the Brazilian is the best goalkeeper in the country, if not the world.</p>    <p>In broad terms, Liverpool have been really good in both boxes. Alongside Van Dijk and Alisson, Ibrahima Konaté, Joe Gomez and 20-year-old Jarell Quansah have all played key parts in the team having the best defence in the league, as did Joël Matip before the season-ending knee ligament injury he sustained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/liverpools-joel-matip-set-to-be-ruled-out-for-months-with-knee-ligament-injury\" title=\"\">in the 4-3 victory over Fulham</a> last month, while in attack all five forwards have contributed to the team’s success. Indeed in only five of the 31 games Liverpool have played in all competitions this season has none of Salah, Darwin Núñez, Diogo Jota, Luis Díaz or Cody Gakpo scored. If one doesn’t get you …</p> <p>No discussion of Liverpool’s attack is complete without a mention of Núñez, who continues to divide opinion like perhaps no other player in Liverpool’s history. But what is without dispute is that the Uruguayan is making an impact with his relentless work rate and clever, unselfish movement – he is fifth in the league for non-penalty expected goals and assisted goals: 12.8 – and if the 24-year-old can find a way of taking more of the chances that come his way it could legitimately be what carries Liverpool to the title.</p> <p>What could be their undoing is the midfield. The balance has not been right since the failure to properly replace Fabinho in the summer, leading to Alexis Mac Allister largely playing as the No 6 since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/liverpool-confirm-alexis-mac-allister-signing-brighton-35m\" title=\"\">arrival from Brighton in June</a>. It is not the Argentinian’s best position, something that has been exposed during the campaign and could be again in the months to come. Meanwhile his fellow summer recruit Dominik Szoboszlai has suffered a dip in form after an excellent start to his Liverpool career, while Ryan Gravenberch has impressed only sporadically since his arrival from Bayern Munich in September.</p>    <p>Saying all that, Liverpool’s midfield is undeniably performing with a level of athleticism, aggression, quality and cohesion that was sorely absent last year, with no one affecting that more than Curtis Jones. The 22-year-old has become a hugely reliable presence on the ball – his pass completion rate for the season stands at 91.6% – while he is also often the man who instigates Liverpool’s press. To call the boy from Toxteth a leader in Klopp’s side would be a bit strong, but he’s getting there.</p> <p>Wataru Endo has also contributed to Liverpool’s improvement in midfield having initially struggled after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/18/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-signing-wataru-endo\" title=\"\">arrival from Stuttgart in August</a> and was starting to look like the answer to the No 6 conundrum only for the Japan captain’s departure to the Asian Cup to halt that progress. His absence, along with that of Salah, plus injuries to a number of players, really has come at a bad time for Klopp given the games ahead; after facing Bournemouth, they host another in-form side in Chelsea before travelling to Arsenal, fellow title contenders. In between there is a Carabao Cup semi-final second leg at Fulham to navigate, as well as an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Norwich. The next two weeks are a busy, testing period for Liverpool and, in regards to the title, could prove make or break, especially given City’s relatively kind schedule during the same spell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/10/klopp-finally-fills-the-salah-void-but-fulham-create-enough-to-spark-hope\">Klopp finally fills the Salah void but Fulham create enough to spark hope | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the positive side, Andrew Robertson is close to returning having been out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/20/liverpool-andy-robertson-faces-three-months-out-with-shoulder-injury\" title=\"\">with a shoulder injury since mid-October</a> and, more broadly, there appears to be more wriggle room in regards to dropping points this campaign thanks to the improved competitiveness of the league. City are on pace to finish with 82 points, albeit their record of going on long winning runs in the second half of seasons suggests they will end up with more.</p> <p>All Liverpool can do is keep winning their games, in particular the one against City at Anfield in early March. They are certainly doing enough right now, with Klopp not only having improved his squad but also rotating it to a level that indicates he has recognised exhaustion as being a reason his side came up short the last time they had a shot at four trophies this deep into a season. Before this weekend, eight Liverpool players had completed 1,000-plus league minutes this campaign, fewer than all of their title rivals; City (11), Aston Villa (10), Arsenal (10) and Tottenham (10).</p> <p>The first of those remain the team to beat, however, and Liverpool know that better than anyone. In regards to bad omens they only have to remember their final-day fixtures in the 2018-19 and 2021-22 seasons. In both cases it was Wolves at home. Liverpool’s final-day fixture this season? Wolves at home.</p>",

Camila Batmanghelidjh’s hundreds of mourners may have been a little wary and gloomy packed into Golders Green crematorium, but they didn’t stay that way for long. They were too restless, hopeful and full of mischief.</p> <p>It was never going to be a drily formal ceremony, even in the elegant north London chapel, and it didn’t take long for spontaneous clapping and cheering to break out. An angry aside at Batmanghelidjh’s treatment by the tabloid press. Anecdotes of kindness and fun. A sing-along to the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love.</p> <p>The coffin at the top of the chapel set the tone. Bright white, decorated with clusters of red roses and covered in handwritten felt-tip messages from some of the children. “Queen of the South” said one scrawled legend, accompanied by a big pair of red lips.</p>    <p>Her achievements working with deprived and traumatised young people at Kids Company, her extraordinary entrepreneurialism and knack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/03/an-inspiration-family-and-friends-pay-tribute-to-camila-batmanghelidjh\">changing so many people’s lives for the best</a> tumbled through the service. “She was from a long line of advocates for children’s rights,” said Malcolm Allen. “But none matched her dress style.”</p> <p>Batmanghelidjh’s distinctive style was everywhere. She had become one of the UK’s best known social campaigners, known for warmth, charm and wit. “What is your greatest fear?” she was asked in an Guardian interview. “Beige,” she deadpanned.</p> <p>Her fall, in 2015, would be traumatic and unjust. Ultimately, she would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/09/the-hidden-life-of-camila-batmanghelidjh-why-was-her-exoneration-so-widely-ignored\">exonerated by the courts</a>.</p> <p>She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/02/kids-company-charity-founder-camila-batmanghelidjh-dies-aged-61\">died peacefully in her sleep on New Year’s Day</a>, aged 61. Ill health had dogged her and for the last four years she spent almost all her time in her tiny west Hampstead flat. But if she was depressed or gloomy she never let on. There were children to care for, things to do. “She was in her element, filled with joy and planning her next act,” recalled her brother, Ardi Batmanghelidjh.</p>    <p>Deepti Patel, the former child rights head at Kids Company, called her a “living example of radical moral courage and empathy”. The writer Bella Freud recalled how Batmanghelidjh was “straight-talking”. To cheers, she attacked what she called the “neo-lynch mob” media that brought the charity down. At the end, the poet Lemn Sissay read Invisible Kisses and had the place in tears. “All I can send is love,” he said.</p> <p>The wake took place a few miles to the south at the Oasis church at Waterloo in inner city London. There, the love and pain came thicker and rawer – if anything, more joyful. Maybe 400 people were packed in to hear songs, memories and jokes.</p> <p>The Rev Steve Chalke, the baptist minister and founder of the Oasis schools trust, said that in Waterloo the life expectancy gap between the richest and poorest stood at 17.4 years. “She knew that that had to end,” he said. “She also knew it was all about love and understanding and listening and caring and relationships.”</p>    <p>Chalke had hired Batmanghelidjh in 2015. She insisted he should not publicise her involvement because by then her name had become a byword for scandal. Her email at Oasis was Camila backwards: Ali-Mac. Some years later they worked together on a youth jail project for the Ministry of Justice. “I couldn’t tell them she was involved,” recalled Chalke. “I told them ‘my friend Ali’ helped me.”</p> <p>Batmanghelidjh’s legacy wasn’t going to end here, said one speaker. Her family and former Kids Company colleagues have set up a Camila Batmanghelidjh Foundation to continue her teaching.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon, the tributes were coming spontaneously. Craig, a tall man with a white denim jacket emblazoned with the bright red legend “Camila”, stood up to address the packed hall. For him she had been a life-saver, he said, his voice cracking. At Kids Company he “wasn’t a number, I wasn’t just a category. Without her, I wouldn’t be here today.”</p>",

His return from an eight-month ban comes not a moment too soon for Brentford, who are ankle deep in the relegation quicksand and in urgent need of both his ability and personality.</p> <p>Brentford were doing okay without Toney, but the loss of his strike partner Bryan Mbeumo through injury made Premier League life unmanageable. Brentford have lost all five league games since Mbeumo’s injury; he won’t be back until mid-March, so it’s Toney’s turn to be the club’s chief pointswinner.</p> <p>Toney has talked a magnificent game ahead of his return. In his interviews he has sounded like a boxer before a big fight, calmly promising what he intends to do to anyone who gets in his way. Toney’s fighting talk, stirring even for the neutral, has added a layer of anticipation to what was already the biggest comeback of its type in England since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/22/manchester-united-liverpool-class-of-92-spice-boys-eric-cantona\">Eric Cantona turned up his collar on 1 October 1995</a>.</p> <p>Forest are the team who have drawn the short straw, although given their recent form they’re unlikely to fear Brentford. Were it not for FA charges hanging over them, they’d be entirely confident of avoiding relegation. Now they are in the peculiar position of not knowing how many points they need to stay up. So they might as well get as many as they can.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>5.30pm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BrentfordFC/status/1748740499786092721\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">He’s back. <a href=\"https://t.co/4Jeg4Vu8DX\">pic.twitter.com/4Jeg4Vu8DX</a></p>&mdash; Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrentfordFC/status/1748740499786092721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-20T16:31:43.280Z\">at 4.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Yet while his comeback from a ban for breaching betting rules ended with a goal, the only surprise being that it was not the winner.</p> \n<p>That honour was reserved for Toney’s strike partner Neal Maupay, who performed a special celebration with the England striker after a topsy-turvy second half in which Ben Mee’s header had been cancelled out by Nottingham Forest’s Chris Wood.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/20/thats-a-new-one-on-me-nuno-baffled-by-toney-moving-ball-to-score-free-kick\">‘That’s a new one on me’: Nuno baffled by Toney moving ball to score free-kick</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Toney had earlier scored, his 33rd Premier League goal in 67 appearances, following Danilo’s opener as Brentford ended a run of five successive defeats – underlining how important the striker is to their chances of survival. Thomas Frank’s side move up to 14th and above their opponents in the table to end a difficult week for Nuno Espírito Santo’s side after they were charged with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/15/premier-league-charge-nottingham-forest-everton#:~:text=The%20league%20said%20Everton%20and,ending%20season%202022%2D23.%E2%80%9D\" title=\"\">breaching the Premier League’s financial rules</a>.</p> \n<p>They struggled to contain Toney throughout as he showed no signs of rustiness despite not having played a competitive match for 259 days since a 1-0 defeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/06/liverpool-brentford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">to Liverpool at Anfield</a> in May. The 28-year-old was given a standing ovation as Brentford’s players performed a lap of honour at the end. Yet after a billboard declaring “He’s back” was erected earlier this week on the A4, there was always a chance Forest could upset the party given their recent revival under Nuno that had seen them win their past two league matches.</p> \n<p>Brentford’s leaky defence this season has been a major factor in their slide down the table and Vitaly Janelt’s panicked clearance in the third minute handed the visitors an opportunity that could have easily been avoided. It still took an astonishing piece of skill from Danilo to control the ball on his thigh and dispatch a volley past Mark Flekken. “Ivan Toney, you should have cashed out,” sang the Forest fans in mocking delight.</p> \n<p>It did not take long for Toney to respond. When Mikkel Damsgaard was brought down clumsily by Orel Mangala on the edge of the box, he immediately grabbed the ball. Forest’s wall seemed to make his task much easier by not covering the whole of Matt Turner’s goal after Toney twice moved the ball from its original position but the accuracy of his low, curled free-kick meant it was always going in despite Nuno’s protests on the touchline. As the home crowd erupted in joy, Toney sprinted down the touchline to celebrate with Frank before being passed a shirt bearing the message “Thank you Uncle Brian”.</p> \n<p>Toney’s perseverance almost helped Brentford take the lead soon after when his cutback from the byline teed up Keane Lewis-Potter for an effort from close range that crashed into the crossbar, with Forest goalkeeper Turner relieved to grab the ball at the second attempt after it hit his back leg from the rebound.</p> \n<p>Brentford picked up where they left off at the start of the second half when a pinpoint cross from Toney found Lewis-Potter at the back post but he could only direct his effort straight at Turner. The England striker was at the heart of Brentford’s attacks and created the space that ended with Lewis-Potter spurning another good chance. There was no stopping Mee’s thumping header from Jensen’s corner moments later as the defender left his marker Gonzalo Montiel for dead before producing a finish Toney would have been proud of.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Maupay could have given the hosts breathing space when he was played in by Toney but Montiel made a crucial intervention. When Wood headed home Callum Hudson-Odoi’s cross to equalise – his sixth goal in his past six matches – a draw seemed to have been secured but it took Brentford less than two minutes to regain the lead when Maupay swept home a cross from Mads Roerslev after more excellent play from Toney. Forest’s players were adamant the ball had struck his arm but the VAR was satisfied the ball brushed his chest.</p> \n<p>Mangala came closest to rescuing a point for Forest when he dragged a shot just wide but there was no stopping Toney on his grand return.</p>",

I’ve seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that’s really making me a bit stressed,” he said.</p> <p>“Even if his idea [for ending the war] – that no one has heard yet – doesn’t work for us, for our people, he will do anything to implement his idea anyway. And this worries me a little,” he added.</p> <p>Zelenskiy said he would invite Trump to Ukraine – an offer he has previously declined to extend – but only if the former president comes through on his promise to stop the war.</p> <p>“Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come,” Zelenskiy said.</p> <p>The Ukrainian leader’s comments come after the Republican presidential frontrunner has claimed he is well positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged without any attempt at a negotiated settlement between the two countries for almost two years.</p> <p>In September, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-pleased-putins-praise-ukraine-russia-meet-the-press-rcna105298\">said</a> that if re-elected president, he would resolve the war within 24 hours but declined to outline his peace plan. “If I tell you exactly, I lose all my bargaining chips. I mean, you can’t really say exactly what you’re going to do. But I would say certain things to Putin. I would say certain things to Zelenskiy,” he said.</p> <p>Trump has also said he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders, and repeatedly made flattering comments about the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, including describing him as a “smart” political player who had taken over a “great piece of land” with only minor economic sanctions.</p> <p>Zelenskiy’s comments come as the Biden administration has signaled it is prepared to make concessions around security at the US-Mexico border to obtain a multibillion-dollar military arms package to Ukraine currently held up by Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>Top aides to Joe Biden reportedly told lawmakers at a meeting last week that if Congress fails to authorize additional aid, Russia could win the war in a matter of weeks or months at best.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/incredibly-stark-biden-aides-give-lawmakers-grim-assessment-ukraine-ai-rcna134792\">According to NBC News</a>, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the meeting that Ukraine will run out of certain air defense and artillery supplies in the coming weeks. A White House official described the situation as “incredibly stark”.</p> <p>They also warned that failing to supply Ukraine with more weapons could prompt US allies, including Japan and South Korea, to rethink their alliances and that a Russian victory in Ukraine “will reverberate around the world”.</p> <p>Separately, the head of the UN atomic watchdog warned that Russian mines had been re-planted in the buffer zone around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after they were removed in November.</p> <p>The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company described the alleged planting of mines around Zaporizhzhia, which is one of world’s 10 biggest nuclear power stations, as “another crime” by Russian forces.

Inevitably, he and other Tory MPs in former Labour seats captured in 2019 now face a year of relentless electioneering – and many believe a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/09/why-the-tories-hardline-immigration-policies-wont-win-over-uk-voters\" title=\"\">tough stance on immigration</a> will help them.</p> <p>On a frosty morning in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, a small former mining community in the constituency, there was some evidence for Anderson’s claims. “There’s too many people in the country, I think,” said Ivan Rose, who recently retired. “If you keep building houses, we’ll get more flooding like we’ve had.”</p>    <p>Sharon Shu, selling shoes in the market, said her mother had friends who were scared to boil the kettle for fear of their electricity bill. “I think we should look after them first,” she said. Another shopper even suggests “minefields along the Channel”.</p> <p>Yet the overriding sentiment among those who spoke to the <em>Observer</em> was a visceral hostility to all politicians – an anti-politics instinct that long predates Channel crossings and which some accuse Anderson of fuelling. “I’ve voted for both parties over the years, but it’s difficult to vote for anyone at the moment,” said Rose. “I don’t think they’re bothered about people up here.”</p> <p>Tony Shu, working in the market with his wife, agreed. “It’s just like a continual flow of bad news,” he said. “What could win an election for a party? I don’t know whether anybody’s offering anything different.”</p> <p>It doesn’t take long to discover why many here feel abandoned. While terms like “red wall seat” and “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2023/oct/25/levelling-up-must-be-led-by-englands-left-behind-neighbourhoods\" title=\"\">left-behind town</a>” have become a political shorthand for these former industrial heartlands, it is easy to detect a deeply held pride in the area’s past that has been bruised over decades.</p> <p>That civic pride is personified in Kirkby by Christine Kidger, 75, whose free labour has kept the town’s heritage centre (a shop front just off the high street) going for years. She previously championed a commemorative mosaic near the site of Summit Colliery, Kirkby, which has since become a business park.</p>    <p>“I left school when I was 15,” she explained. “I could have given a job up on the Friday and I could’ve had a new job for the Monday. When you’ve got your pit, you’ve got your community, haven’t you? The pit closed in ’69. Then of course all the factories went. A lot of the shops are gone. All we’ve got really now is takeaways and barbers and nail places. It’s sad when you think about how it was and now.”</p> <p>It is a lament instantly recognised by Gloria De Piero, who represented the area for Labour until 2019. “If you’d gone back 30 or 40 years, all the men would have worked on the pits and the women would have worked in textiles. There were good, well-paid jobs. Now, people are working, but not paid very well. There’s a great community spirit. People care about law and order, border controls. But they’re typically more left wing economically. They know that they’re getting a raw deal.”</p> <p>That sense of stagnation has set the scene for an election campaign here fuelled by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2024/jan/04/youre-right-to-be-anti-westminster-anger-at-uk-politics-is-justified-says-starmer-video\" title=\"\">anti-Westminster sentiment</a>. It means that while a Labour victory looks likely in theory, there can be no guarantee it will overturn Anderson’s 5,733-vote majority. It may help explain that while there has been a rush of would-be Labour candidates in nearby Rushcliffe, there has not been such a stampede to be the party’s representative in Ashfield.</p> <p>In fact, Labour didn’t even secure second place at the last election. In a sign of the Westminster hostility, that went to an independent candidate, Jason Zadrozny, the leader of the district council. Zadrozny is running again – he has already attacked Anderson as being “as thick as mince” – despite currently facing trial on 12 counts of fraud by false representation and four counts of income tax evasion. He denies the charges.</p>    <p>Then there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/jan/15/reform-uk-party-conservatives-ukip-rightwing-brexit-conservative-voters-podcast\" title=\"\">Reform UK</a>, the successor to the Brexit party, whose candidate Henry Grisewood – a “positive psychology” coach – believes he can be the most plain speaking in a race between plain speakers. “There’s lots of changes that need to happen in Great Britain,” he said. “Reform has got some really genuinely good ideas. They’re not just saying it, like most political parties.”</p> <p>While Anderson has chosen an outspoken style and immigration as the topic with which to tap into local angst, it is also clear he has become a divisive figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/archive-zip/giv-13425IBI7TdeiWAfb/\" > <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/archive-zip/giv-13425IBI7TdeiWAfb/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“I think he comes out with really ill-informed comments. Quite significant comments about immigration, but also homeless people,” said Laura Walker, 51, who was out walking her dog. She accused him of fuelling local despair. “People have been seduced into feeling aggrieved about things – and that leads to them thinking that people who don’t work or aren’t from the UK are somehow responsible for that.” Another constituent said all he wanted was “the end of Lee Anderson”.</p> <p>There are those openly opting for Labour, but it comes with heavy scepticism. “I’ll probably vote Labour and see what happens,” said Susan Crooks, with a sigh. Her husband Malcolm is more cynical. “All Labour does is diss the Conservatives but not actually say what they would do differently, which is totally annoying. So we’re none the wiser.”</p> <p>Back in Westminster, many colleagues of Anderson and other red wall MPs – such as Miriam Cates in Penistone and Stocksbridge or Andrea Jenkyns in Morley and Outwood – question whether their chosen tactic will ultimately help them. “That’s not how national elections work,” said one veteran. Another observed, more bluntly: “It won’t work.”</p>",

The Spaniard worked at Barcelona before in 2011 joining City Football Group, of which City are the prime club among the 12 owned by the Abu Dhabi-funded collective.

His appointment is understood to be a joint decision between the Ineos owner and the Americans. He will take up the appointment in the summer.</p> <p>A City statement said the club “understands his decision to look for a new challenge and he leaves with our thanks and best wishes”, while United said: “The club is determined to put football and performance on the pitch back at the heart of everything we do. Omar’s appointment is the first step on this journey.”</p> <p>The news follows Sir Dave Brailsford, the mastermind behind Team Sky and its Ineos-Grenadiers successor, stepping away from cycling to focus on his new role at United. As chief sporting adviser to Ratcliffe, Brailsford is to concentrate on an audit into the club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/24/sir-jim-ratcliffe-manchester-united-stake-announced\">Ratcliffe paid £1.25bn to buy a quarter share </a>of and take control of sporting affairs.</p> <p>Brailsford founded Team Sky in 2010 and they won their first Tour de France in 2012, Bradley Wiggins ­taking the first of seven of eight ­editions up to 2019 by four riders, Chris Froome collecting four. The team collected five further Grand Tours under the Sky and Ineos banner that ­followed a rebrand in 2019.</p> <p>The Derbyshire-born but Welsh-bred Brailsford has been team ­principal throughout that time. </p> <p>Before Ratcliffe’s move for a stake in United, Brailsford was ­working with Nice, second in France’s Ligue 1 table. Ineos also owns the Swiss club Lausanne, Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup sailing team and has a share in the Mercedes F1 team.</p> <p>Since Ratcliffe’s deal with the Glazer family was confirmed on Christmas Eve, Brailsford has been a regular ­visitor to the Old Trafford directors’ box and was sitting with Sir Alex Ferguson and Ratcliffe during&nbsp;last&nbsp;Sunday’s 2-2 draw with&nbsp;Tottenham.</p> <p>During a brief introduction to the press, Ratcliffe expected his deal for United to be completed by “early Feb” and said: “I have done a few exciting things, but this caps it all. There’s no question about that.”</p> <p>Brailsford, an often controversial figure during his time on the frontline of road cycling and notorious for his belief in “marginal gains”, has been detailed with overhauling the distressed asset Ratcliffe has bought into. United’s latest quarterly figures, released this week, showed the Glazers’s debt has increased to £773m and that an additional £364m is owed in unpaid transfer fee instalments.</p> <p>While Brailsford conducts his audit, Ratcliffe is understood to be willing to be patient with the United manager, Erik ten Hag, though the delay of his buy-in after 13 months of negotiation with the Glazers means there is unlikely to be investment during the January transfer window.</p>",

Saturday’s presumed Israeli strike was the second such high-profile targeted assassination in Syria in less than a month. In December, an Israeli airstrike killed a senior Iranian general there.</p> <p>Israel has also targeted enemies in Lebanon. On 2 January in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, the deputy political leader of Hamas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/02/saleh-al-arouri-assassinated-leader-was-hamass-link-to-iran-and-hezbollah\">Saleh al-Arouri</a>, was killed in a strike widely blamed on Israel.</p> <p>Days later, Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/14/israel-risking-serious-escalation-by-killing-hezbollah-leaders-say-diplomats\">killed</a> Wissam al-Tawil, a senior Hezbollah commander, in a strike on his car in south Lebanon.</p> <p>Israel rarely comments on individual strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran, which backs the government of the president, Bashar al-Assad, to expand its presence there.</p> <p>Israeli analysts have spoken of a “multifront war”, with combat operations in Syria, Lebanon, the occupied West Bank and Gaza against what they describe as a coalition of enemies dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state. Iran describes its networks of proxy armed factions as an axis of resistance.</p> <p>Israel’s offensive in Gaza continued on Saturday with airstrikes and artillery shelling pounding targets across the territory. Fighters from Hamas battled tanks trying to advance into the eastern suburbs of the Jabaliya area in northern Gaza, where Israel has started pulling out troops and shifting to smaller-scale operations, residents and militant sources said.</p> <p>In the southern area of Khan Younis, where Israel says it has expanded its operations against Hamas, witnesses said tanks shelled areas around Nasser hospital overnight, describing the bombardment as the most intense in many days.</p> <p>Nasser is now Gaza’s largest functioning hospital. Israel says Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, including Nasser, which Hamas and medical staff deny, though Israel has presented some footage and photos backing its claims.</p> <p>The Israeli military said that in Khan Younis it raided a military compound, neutralised ready-to-use rocket launchers and found explosives stashed underground while an aircraft struck two gunmen there.</p> <p>Israeli planes dropped leaflets on the southern area of Rafah urging Palestinians seeking refuge there to help locate hostages held by Hamas since the militant organisation launched bloody attacks into Israel in October, residents said.</p> <p>The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes have killed 165 people and wounded 280 others in the past 24 hours, one of the biggest death tolls in a single day in 2024.</p> <p>It did not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its daily toll. But most of the 24,927 Palestinians killed since the 7 October war began are civilians, health officials say.</p> <p>Israel has vowed to “crush” Hamas in Gaza after its fighters broke through a billion-dollar perimeter fence and surged into Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking about 250 hostages into Gaza.</p> <p>In more than 100 days of war, Israel’s air, land and sea offensive has destroyed much of Gaza, displacing most of the 2.3 million population, many forced to move repeatedly and seek refuge in tents that do little to protect them from the elements and disease, according to the United Nations.</p> <p>The leaflets dropped by Israel on Rafah showed photographs of 33 hostages, their names written in Arabic, urging the displaced to make contact. “Do you want to return home? Please make the call if you recognise one of them,” the leaflets read.</p> <p>More than 100 of the hostages seized by Hamas were freed during a short-lived November truce in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, 27 of whom have been killed in captivity.</p> <p>In Israel, political leaders are under increasing pressure to do more to free the hostages. Last week a senior minister called for a ceasefire to allow a deal and families of hostages camped outside Netanyahu’s residence in the coastal city of Caesarea.</p> <p>“He needs to choose one [deal] and end the hostage saga,” said Eli Stivi, whose son, Idan, is being held incommunicado in Gaza.</p>",

On Saturday, protesters gathered in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Caesarea and Kfar Saba, some calling for bolder action to secure the release of hostages, and others demanding the prime minister step down.</p> <p>One in Jerusalem held a placard that read: “Mothers’ cry: we will not sacrifice our children in the war to save the rightwing.” </p>    <p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu sparred publicly – if indirectly – with US President Joe Biden, who for months has offered Israel almost unconditional support for its war in Gaza, at considerable political cost to his own administration, both in America and beyond.</p> <p>Netanyahu’s spokesman claimed that in a phone call with Biden, the Israeli leader told the US president that his country’s security needs left no space for a sovereign Palestinian state.</p> <p>“In his conversation with President Biden, prime minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that, after Hamas is destroyed, Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,” a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said.</p> <p>It was a barely veiled shot at Biden, who just hours earlier had said the same conversation left him confident an independent Palestine was feasible when Netanyahu was in power.</p> <p>The two men had spoken for the first time in nearly a month after Netanyahu alarmed his allies by ruling out an independent Palestinian state in a press conference.</p> <p>He said even after fighting ends in Gaza, Israel would need to keep security control of all land west of the River Jordan. “That’s a necessary condition. It clashes with the principle of sovereignty but what can you do.”</p> <p>In London, the shadow foreign secretary David Lammy was strongly critical of Netanyahu. “The Israeli prime minister’s rejection of a Palestinian state is morally wrong. Practically wrong. And against the interests of all people, Palestinian and Israeli,” Lammy said in a speech to the Fabian Society conference, during which he was interrupted by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.</p> <p>Lammy added: “The peaceful quest for a Palestinian state is a just cause. As Keir Starmer has said, it is the undeniable right of the Palestinian people, and the only path to guarantee a just and lasting peace for both Israelis and Palestinians.”</p> <p>A British government spokesman described Netanyahu’s comments as “disappointing”. “The UK’s position is very clear. A two-state solution, with a viable and sovereign Palestinian state living alongside a safe and secure Israel, is the best route to lasting peace.”</p> <p>The US has repeatedly said that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only path to rebuilding Gaza and ensuring Israel’s long-term security.</p> <p>Critics said the dispute proved a useful distraction from growing domestic tension about the limited achievements of Israel’s campaign in Gaza over three months into the war, the suffering of more than 100 Israelis still held hostage by Hamas, and the lack of a long-term plan for governing the enclave.</p> <p>“This war has no purpose and no future, but prolonging it is [Netanyahu’s] way of postponing engagement with the question of responsibility,” the <em>Haaretz</em> newspaper quoted a cabinet member saying.</p> <p>“As long as the protest [movement] is dealing with the hostages’ return, the protest that he fears, against the government, is delayed.”</p> <p>After more than three months, Israeli attacks have killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, displaced nearly 2 million people and reduced much of Gaza to ruins. Hunger and disease stalk crowded camps and shelters.</p> <p>Yet Israeli forces have yet to capture or kill any of the group’s leaders inside Gaza, and Hamas recently launched a barrage of rockets from northern Gaza, where Israel had said the group’s fighting ability had largely been destroyed.</p> <p>Israel has had more success beyond Israel’s borders; one top official, Saleh al Arouri, was assassinated by a drone strike in Beirut in early January. A senior Hezbollah leader was killed soon after.</p> <p>On Saturday, a strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, also killed five Iranian military advisers, destroying a building in a tightly guarded neighbourhood, and a second attack in southern Lebanon killed two people, local media reported.</p>    <p>The Israeli public broadly supports the war. Less than a month ago, polls from the Israeli Institute of Democracy <a href=\"https://en.idi.org.il/articles/52085\" title=\"\">showed</a> that three-quarters of Jewish Israelis opposed the US demand to shift to a less intense phase of the war in Gaza.</p> <p>But they are increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu’s leadership. Critics include a member of Netanyahu’s own war cabinet, Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of the Israeli military whose views carry particular moral authority because his 25-year-old son was killed fighting in Gaza.</p> <p>Eisenkot broke ranks this week to say “total victory” over Hamas was not likely and only a ceasefire deal could bring hostages home. When asked if Netanyahu might be prolonging the war for political gain, he paused before replying: “I hope not.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/20/observer-view-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-needs-a-change-of-course-and-leadership\">The Observer view on Benjamin Netanyahu: Israel needs a change of course… and leadership | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Official investigations into military and security failures in the run-up to the Hamas 7 October attacks, which are currently on hold pending the end of the intense phase of fighting, are likely to be very uncomfortable for Netanyahu. He also faces several long-running corruption cases.</p> <p>Eisenkot is widely believed to be aligned in his views with Benny Gantz, another former general and defence minister on the five-member war cabinet. Netanyahu, his current defence minister Yoav Gallant and strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer are the other members, and want to keep on fighting.</p> <p>Netanyahu’s coalition government includes far-right parties who are adamantly opposed to a Palestinian state, or any let-up in the intensity of the attacks on Gaza.</p> <p>The concessions needed to secure the release of hostages, including freeing many Palestinian prisoners, would probably prompt them to leave, and collapse his government.</p> <p>There was a consensus after 7 October that Israel could not waste energy going to the polls when it needed to focus on the war. Now, most of Israel expects elections this year; the question is how soon, and what will finally splinter the unity government.</p> <p>Most polling shows Netanyahu’s government would lose power to an opposition coalition if voters turned out in Israel today. But Channel 14 has repeatedly found Netanyahu would only lose a handful of seats, and might be able to cling to power.</p>",

The Royals are in crisis and 90 minutes of football at least brings some normality to the supporters from Berkshire who made the trek up to Wigan, even if the match ended in a 1-0 defeat.</p> \n<p>Wigan fans know the pain of poor ownership, starting the season with an eight-point deduction after previous owners Phoenix Ltd failed to pay wages on time on five separate occasions in a season that concluded with relegation from the Championship alongside Reading. The Latics were served with a winding up petition in June relating to an unpaid tax bill and placed under a transfer embargo but a takeover from local billionaire Mike Danson has put Wigan back on firm ground after paying off outstanding debts.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/18/reading-implement-drastic-cost-cutting-measures-as-financial-crisis-deepens\">Reading implement drastic cost-cutting measures as financial crisis deepens</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The two clubs were relegated from the Premier League in 2012-13 and neither have returned to the top flight since. Unlike Reading fans, Wigan’s faithful know they will have a team to support next season, which is more important than any victory.</p> \n<p>What Reading fans would do for their own saviour. They have been docked 16 points since November 2021 and sit 21st in the third tier, relegation to League Two an increasing possibility and the fans have decided to fight back. The “Sell Before We Dai” campaign leading the charge for Reading to raise awareness of their plight.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/18/reading-implement-drastic-cost-cutting-measures-as-financial-crisis-deepens\">level of cost-cutting is stark</a>, from catering to heating to making 19 members of staff redundant. Centre-back Nelson Abbey was absent from the side, expecting to be sold imminently to raise funds. Rubén Sellés admits he is working on a day-to-day basis because uncertainty dictates how he can manage the club.</p> \n<p>“The more people showing to be supporting the team and the players, as opposed to the owner, the better,” says Paul Ellix, one of 621 Reading supporters in attendance.</p> \n<p>“The owner has made a right mess of this, whether he has done it deliberately or not, when he realised he could not make the Premier League after he took over. I think protests are right, I don’t think they are going to make the slightest bit of difference to the owner. I think at the end of day the owner is going to do nothing and we are going to have to create a phoenix club somewhere down the line.”</p> \n<p>The players deserve the backing from the stands, watching a spirited second-half display at Wigan, worthy of a draw, but Thelo Aasgaard settled the result with a fine curling shot just after the half-hour. Amid all the chaos, Reading had lost one of their previous nine league matches. There is quality in the team but fans fear more players being sold before the window closes and potential additional sanctions from authorities which will make it almost impossible to survive.</p> \n<p>“I can completely understand why the fans have taken the action they have,” says Reading supporter Mike Pendlebury. “How else would we get our voice heard? Dai Yongge has previous – he has put a Chinese and a Belgian one [club] out of business and I fear we will be the third.”</p> \n<p>Last week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/13/reading-match-abandoned-as-fans-occupy-pitch-in-protest-against-owner\">home game against Port Vale was abandoned</a> after Reading supporters invaded the pitch to protest against the owner but objections were more restrained in Greater Manchester, using words to make their point; “Stand up if you hate Dai Yongge” was repeated in the North Stand, not that Dai will listen. Fans fear this could be their final season watching the club as they know it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“I think it would be tragic, not just for Reading but the whole of Berkshire if we went out of business,” Ellix says. “I don’t mind if we get relegated, I would prefer if we didn’t. I want him to sell, someone to take over that has the club at heart, not someone that is looking to make a club profit.”</p> \n<p>Defeats hurt but nothing compares to the pain being felt by Reading fans fearing a football oblivion. There is plenty of spirit in the stands and on the pitch but they are all relying on the whim of one man. Football is not about owners, it is about fans and they deserve the final word: “Get out of our club”.</p>",

While the UK may no longer be part of the EU, London is, and always will be, a European city.”</p> <p>Khan wants new rules to allow young people to study, travel and fill vacancies in key sectors of the economy. This would apply to Londoners wanting to go to EU countries and young EU citizens wanting to come to London.</p> <p>Last July, former Tory cabinet minister and leading Brexiter George Eustice backed a similar idea, calling on Rishi Sunak’s government to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/08/tory-brexiter-george-eustice-visas-young-eu-workers-labour-shortage\" title=\"\">open bilateral negotiations with EU nations immediately</a>, with a view to offering young Europeans under 35 the right to two-year visas to work in this country.</p> <p>Eustice said the deals should be reciprocal, so that young UK citizens under 35 would be able to live and work for two years in the same EU member states with which deals were struck. This, he said, would be part of a much-needed “post-Brexit reconciliation” with our European neighbours.</p> <p>The Home Office has said it is looking at the possibility of some form of youth mobility scheme.</p> <p>It is understood that Khan believes a new scheme could be of particular benefit to sectors such as hospitality, which is historically reliant on EU workers, who do not meet the criteria for a visa under the new points-based immigration scheme.</p> <p>The hospitality sector has seen some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/08/hiring-boom-fading-but-three-quarters-of-uk-firms-still-struggle-to-find-staff\" title=\"\">highest worker shortages post-pandemic</a>.</p> <p>Naomi Smith, chief executive of the internationalist thinktank Best for Britain, said polling by her organisation showed clear support for such a move, as more and more people concluded that Brexit was restricting young people’s life chances and harming the economy.</p> <p>“A reciprocal youth mobility scheme with the EU is win-win, giving young Brits the chance to live, work and travel across the continent while throwing a lifeline to UK businesses still suffering from acute labour shortages made worse by Brexit,” she said.</p> <p>Charles Owen, managing director of Seasonal Businesses in Travel, a trade body that represents many holiday companies, said: “The UK has some of the best-loved pubs, clubs, hotels and restaurants in the world but the pandemic, food inflation, the energy crisis and labour shortages has hit the industry hard. A youth mobility scheme is not a magic bullet; but it could relieve some of the pressure on labour shortages and save some from pulling down their shutters for good.”</p> <p>A recent independent report by the analyst Cambridge Econometrics, commissioned by City Hall, showed London has 290,000 fewer jobs than if Brexit had not happened, with half the total 2m job losses nationwide coming in the financial services and construction sectors.</p> <p>The report found that the average Briton was nearly £2,000 worse off in 2023, while the average Londoner was nearly £3,400 worse off last year as a result of Brexit. It also calculates that there are nearly 2m fewer jobs overall in the UK because of Brexit, with almost 300,000 fewer jobs in the capital alone.</p>",

We also work together, which should be a nightmare but isn’t. It is rare to find a man in showbiz happy to be the wind beneath your wings. He plays guitar and characters in all my shows but never wants the spotlight himself. He’s a rare find – an artist who genuinely just wants to do the job because it is a nice job to do.</p>    <p>After every show people tell me they loved it but they <em>really</em> loved watching Tim watching me. “You can just see how much he loves you,” they say, to which I want to reply: “He is a trained actor so he could just be very good at his job.” Still, I’ve never known a more generous man on or off stage.</p> <p>He smiles for photos on the red carpet and he warmly entertains the important people whose names I can’t remember in theatre foyers. When my manager worries I might be burnt out, she asks Tim rather than me because he knows me better than I know myself. When I finish a season he tricks me into stopping and reflecting with a cup of tea and a bath. He is my assistant, my partner, my collaborator. My best friend (yuck!).</p> <p>And he is – most importantly – very silly. As I write this, he has come to interrupt me twice to show two versions of the lightning storm he’s watching, through dance. He is not a dancer.</p> <p>When I am sure a new show is the worst thing I’ve ever written, he looks me dead in the eyes and says: “Shut the fuck up and have fun.” He holds my hand backstage before every opening night and helps me find my place when I lose my lines. He activates girly mode and gossips with my friends about their romantic escapades. He lets me blame my farts on our dog. These gentle, silly moments every day – these are when I know.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michelle Brasier’s show <a href=\"https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/events/michelle-brasier-average-bear\">Average Bear</a> is at the Sydney Theatre Company, Wharf 1 Theatre, on 25-26 January as part of Sydney festival.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Would you like to share your love story for the moment I knew?

He had just enough time to move his cars under canvas sails, sparing them from damage.</p> <p>Plowright isn’t alone in having little warning before wild weather during Australia’s seemingly relentless summer of extremes.

It counts local councils and big insurers among its customers.</p> <p>Private businesses have long offered services based on data from BoM or agencies such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). But Early Warning Network is starting to test artificial intelligence models that promise to make a lot more weather information available both rapidly and at low cost.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“You have to pay a bucket load for [ECMWF] data,” Plowright says. “We don’t need now a supercomputer to go and run a forecast that will be extremely accurate up to 10 days, especially for extreme weather.”</p> <p>Artificial intelligence “is going to be absolutely phenomenal with weather and ultimately climate too, once it gets there”, he predicts.</p> <h2>How AI can help us prepare for weather extremes</h2> <p>Juliette Murphy, a water resources engineer, is similarly excited. She founded FloodMapp to give communities more time to prepare after monitoring devastating floods in Queensland’s Lockyer region in 2011 and then in the Canadian city of Calgary two years later.</p> <p>FloodMapp uses machines that learn from each model run as well as traditional physics-based hydrology and hydraulic models. Even relatively basic computers can comb through “really large datasets” quickly to identify likely effects of a flood, she says.</p> <p>Her clients include Queensland’s fire and emergency services. Its results complement BoM’s, helping authorities decide which homes to evacuate and which roads to close. “That’s important not least because almost half of flood deaths involve people in cars,” Murphy says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/20/flood-warnings-prompt-evacuations-in-nt-as-queensland-braces-for-incoming-cyclone\">Flood warnings prompt evacuations in NT as Queensland braces for incoming cyclone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A BoM spokesperson says the bureau had been “proactively and safely engaging with artificial intelligence capabilities for several years”.</p> <p>“This area of research is one of many initiatives the bureau actively pursues to improve its services to government, emergency management partners and the community,” she says.</p> <p>Justin Freeman, a computer scientist, ran BoM’s research team which was working on machine learning before he left in in late 2022 to set up his own firm, Flowershift.</p> <p>Flowershift is building a geospatial model trained on existing observational data. “We would be filling in gaps around what the current forecast products are”, such as providing forecasts in remote regions of Australia or beyond, Freeman says.</p> <p>“There’s a lot more flexibility to be able to explore things [outside BoM] and use technologies which are very new,” says Freeman, who still does contract work for the bureau. “We’ve got this whole new different class of models which are completely different to what [the bureau had] been running for the last 50 years.”</p> <p>There are many potential uses for models that can analyse data cheaply and then supply localised information. Farmers, for instance, could ask, “Should I spray my crops this week?” and be told why or why not, Freeman says.</p> <p>“It hasn’t been that long that we’ve had access to something like ChatGPT,” he says. “Look forward like another two years, five years – it’s just going to accelerate and get better and better.”</p> <h2>The limitations of AI</h2> <p>Some BoM and climate researchers, though, caution how much AI-based models, such Google’s GraphCast or Nvidia’s FourCastNet, can improve on numerical models that churn out a range of probabilities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/19/mark-zuckerberg-artificial-general-intelligence-system-alarms-experts-meta-open-source\">‘Very scary’: Mark Zuckerberg’s pledge to build advanced AI alarms experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“For ‘simple’ weather forecasting and for downscaling physical model data I reckon [there’s] massive potential,” one bureau scientist says. “For warning us of real dangers when the atmosphere gets violent, I’d be very cautious.</p> <p>“And with climate change, we need to better understand things that are well outside the norm.”</p> <p>Sanaa Hobeichi, a post-doctoral researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, says there are still benefits despite the limitations.</p> <p>Existing climate models typically offer only “coarse” resolutions, such as estimating rainfall changes over areas 150km by 150km. In Sydney, for instance, a model that size would capture the city, mountains and a lot besides and so be of limited use.</p> <p>Google’s GraphCast forecast model has a resolution down to 28km by 28km, while Hobeichi says some AI can model just 5km by 5km.</p> <p>A challenge, though, is that machine-learning techniques inherit and potentially extrapolate imperfections of the traditional models they train on.</p> <p>Jyoteeshkumar Reddy Papari, a post-doctoral CSIRO researcher, notes that the ECMWF was initially sceptical of AI but has lately started <a href=\"https://charts.ecmwf.int/products/aifs_medium-mslp-wind850?base_time=202401151200&amp;projection=opencharts_australasia&amp;valid_time=202401241800\">its own experimental model</a>. It is also displaying several others on its website, including <a href=\"https://charts.ecmwf.int/products/graphcast_medium-mslp-wind850?base_time=202401161200&amp;projection=opencharts_australasia&amp;valid_time=202401261200\">Google’s</a>.</p> <p>“Countries that don’t have good meteorological organisations are relying on these machine learning models because they are super easy to learn and are publicly available,” he says. “So some of the African countries are using these forecasts.”</p> <p>Google researchers <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2336\">last year claimed</a> GraphCast “significantly outperforms the most accurate” operational systems in 90% of 1380 targets. Tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers and extreme temperatures were predictions it made which were better than traditional models and improvements are ongoing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/15/ai-jobs-inequality-imf-kristalina-georgieva\">AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality, says IMF head</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“One particular example we often mention was Hurricane Lee, because it was the first time that we observed in real time how GraphCast was predicting a hurricane trajectory that originally differed from the traditional systems, and eventually was shown to be the right trajectory,” said Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, a Goggle researcher. “It was detected in real time and it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WorldClimateSvc/status/1699500014991450509\">verified by independent sources</a>.”</p> <p>Current tracking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/21/queensland-weather-forecast-cyclone-kirrily-expected-to-develop-storms-flood-watch-northern-territory\">the potential cyclone in the Coral Sea</a> – to be named Kirrily if it forms as expected by Monday – will also be monitored to see how models compare.</p> <p>ECMWF’s machine learning coordinator, Matthew Chantry, says AI models are “a very exciting avenue as a companion system for traditional forecasting” although the latter retains some advantages.</p> <p>“Tropical cyclone intensity estimates are a good example,” he says. “It’s an open question whether these flaws are maintained as the technology matures – it is still very early days.”</p> <p>Authorities act based on the probabilities calculated by traditional models but that needs a very large supercomputer. “With AI forecasts, this is dramatically reduced, with some estimates suggesting a 1000-times reduction in the energy to make a forecast. Cheaper systems could therefore be a force for equality.</p> <p>“This reduced cost could also be invested into larger ensembles, meaning that we have a better idea of low-probability but extreme events that could occur.”</p> <p>And as for predicting effects of a heating planet?</p> <p>“The problem is significantly harder than weather forecasting, with less data,” says Chantry. “That said, in a changing climate, where evidence suggests an increase in extreme events, then any help with predicting these events has significant value.”</p>",

Her observations include children being kept four to a cell, stacking up foam mattresses for privacy. Some refused to shower due to a lack of privacy. Guardian Australia reported several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/26/queensland-watch-houses-laws-kids-teens-strip-searches-suicide-attempts\">similar concerns</a> raised bythe youth organisation Youth Empowered Towards Independence (Yeti) last year.</p> <p>“I am not a noisy outlier,” Bates says in her letter. “The observations and the harms I’m about to highlight here within, have been raised many, many times by our workforces across government and by Yeti.”</p> <p>Katherine Hayes, the chief executive of the Youth Advocacy Centre, says the issues that emerged amid overcrowding in watch houses were “completely foreseeable” and that authorities had a duty of care to look after young people in custody.</p> <p>“The override of the Human Rights Act has given an implicit endorsement to disregard the proper treatment of these kids and almost assist in the ongoing dehumanising of them,” she said.</p> <p>“We’ve had many instanced of officers using food and access to family as behaviour management measures.”</p> <p>Asked about the situation at a press conference on Wednesday, the police minister, Mark Ryan, acknowledged there were “capacity constrains across the custodial network” but said police were meeting the needs of people in watch houses.</p> <p>“But there is an observation here,” Ryan said. “When you have stronger laws with harsher penalties, you end up with more people in custody. Many in the community have asked for those stronger laws and harsher penalties.”</p> <h2>‘A death in custody waiting to happen’</h2> <p>In August last year the youth justice minister, Di Farmer, sent a <a href=\"https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/98507\">statement</a> defending the suspension of the Human Rights Act to keep children in police custody.</p> <p>“It is necessary to keep some young people in a watch house – for their safety, for the safety of our staff and the safety of the community,” Farmer said.</p> <p>Farmer did not address questions this week about whether – having cited those concerns for urgent changes to state laws – she felt any obligation to act now, amid mounting and credible concern that the situation inside watch houses presented a serious risk to young people, workers and others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/19/very-little-has-shifted-watch-house-case-a-major-concern-for-first-nations-group-advising-queensland-police\">‘Very little has shifted’: watch house case a major concern for First Nations group advising Queensland police</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bates said conditions had led to “increasing assault rates against QPS [Queensland police service] staff, increasing risk to clinicians and increasing risks to the mental health and wellbeing of our collective workforces in this space”.

It is an incredible risk. It is an unacceptable risk. And I am in fear that it’s a death in custody waiting to happen.”</p> <h2>System broken</h2> <p>Last year the Queensland Family and Child Commission (QFCC) released the findings of a watch house study titled, <a href=\"https://www.qfcc.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-12/FINAL%20-%20Watchhouse%20Review%20-%20Who%27s%20Responsible%20-%20November%202023.pdf\">Who’s responsible</a></p> <p>The conclusion: “No one.”</p> <p>“We heard from courts, police, youth justice and legal providers about how each other was responsible for the causes of and solutions to this issue,” the report said.</p> <p>“The separation of responsibilities across police, courts and youth justice means no one is directly responsible or accountable for how long a young person spends in a watch house, and while demand and capacity pressures occur across multiple systems it is the young people that are left without an effective response.”</p> <p>The QFCC principal commissioner, Luke Twyford, said there had been a “shocking escalation” in the amount of time children spent in watch houses.</p> <p>In 2022 21 children were detained in a watch house in Queensland for 15 days or more. In just the first six months of 2023 108 children were held for more than two weeks.</p> <p>“The tragedy is there are many good people in all our departments and all our services trying to get all the right outcomes, but the system is leading us to detain young people for up to seven weeks,” Twyford said.</p> <p>“There’s a deep frustration that we’re not being effective in our response.</p> <p>“Watch houses are an inappropriate place to keep any young person for an extended period of time. They’re not a place to meet young people’s needs.”</p> <p>In her letter Bates said the “multi-agency” approach adopted by the state government was like “an orchestra with no conductor”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/15/police-cannot-meet-expectations-for-children-in-custody-amid-cairns-watch-house-overcrowding\">Police ‘cannot meet’ expectations for children in custody amid Cairns watch house overcrowding </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Those of us working in the field are being effectively silenced and forced to play on while the Titanic sinks.”</p> <p>Asked about concerns with the multi-agency approach, Farmer said: “The management and operation of Queensland watch houses is the responsibility of the Queensland police service.”</p> <p>Farmer said the department assessed all young people in watch houses daily and that additional access had been granted to support services and youth justice staff.</p> <p>“In addition to three meals a day provided, [the Department of] Youth Justice are providing additional food for young people, including morning and afternoon tea,” Farmer said.</p> <p>Twyford said reports about the Cairns watch house were “especially concerning” and needed to be addressed urgently.</p> <p>In her letter Bates said she and others had already been driven to the point where they could not continue.</p> <p>“The sad indictment of the situation that we all find ourselves in currently is that good people, who have only the best of intentions for our cohort, are passionate about social justice and do their best to support their colleagues, walk away broken with despair,” she said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When Sam Bailey was a teenager, he understood farming as a job for the fit and able-bodied. It was also the only job he could see himself doing. After high school, Bailey left his family farm at Croppa Creek in north-west New South Wales to work as a jackaroo in big stations in northern Australia.</p> <p>Then the vehicle he was travelling in rolled on the Barkly Highway, and “in a heartbeat my whole life was shot down another road”.</p> <p>Bailey returned home a quadriplegic. It was 1987 and the then 19-year-old did not know what to do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/14/australia-weather-el-nino-rain-drought-impact-farming\">Doubt and flooding rains: how an unusual El Niño has affected Australian farmers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Farming is in my blood and I’ve had dirt under the fingernails since day one, but I never imagined I’d arrive home in a wheelchair,” he says.</p> <p>Bailey was advised by medical staff to consider an office job in town. “But I just couldn’t come at that,” he says. “So, against their advice Mum and Dad picked me up and we went home to the farm at Croppa Creek.”</p> <p>With no connection to others in similar circumstances and no internet to research their predicament, Bailey and his family were forced to work out how to make wheelchair adaptations on their farm by themselves.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Freedom and mobility for Bailey returned first with a four-wheel bike. Then came a hand-controlled car and modified farm machinery. To access tractors and headers the family, with help from a bush mechanic in Warialda, devised a motorised hoist fitted with a plastic kitchen chair and mounted on the back of a HiLux.</p> <p>Bailey, now retired to an 80-acre (32-hectare) property near Tamworth, says technology such as drones, which can be used to check stock and water, and autonomous agriculture make life easier for those in wheelchairs. “But I think it’s kind of sad if you just want to farm from your phone inside your house,” he says. “Half the pleasure is going out and seeing the echidna cross the road and the birds flying.”</p>    <h2>Changing the industry</h2> <p>Glen Clarke became a paraplegic after a truck accident in 2003 and, like Bailey, had been advised not to return to his previous life on the family farm at Kempsey, on the NSW mid-north coast.</p> <p>“We were advised to sell the farm and get a job in town but we struggled through with family and changed our operation from cows and calves to steers to make it less labour-intensive,” he says.</p> <p>Like Bailey, Clarke found himself isolated in his new life. There was no network for those with a disability in agriculture.</p> <p>Even off-farm, there were accessibility issues. “I had to use the grains storage ramp to get into the produce store,” Clarke says.</p> <p>Clarke was already married with four children aged between five and 13 at the time of the accident. “The biggest challenge in the early stages was learning acceptance and patience, but I’ve always said you can either lay down or get up and do something about it,” he says.</p> <p>His youngest daughter, Josie, is now undertaking a PhD in agriculture. After one particularly wet season, when Clarke’s wheelchair bogged in the sodden black soil, the pair had a long conversation about support and accessibility issues in agriculture. In 2021 Josie Clarke launched <a href=\"https://abilityagriculture.com/\">Ability Agriculture</a>, a not-for-profit organisation aimed at providing support for people with disabilities in agriculture.</p>    <p>“I wanted to share stories of people with disabilities in agriculture to challenge traditional views, raise awareness, create opportunity and provide a supportive community,” she says.</p> <p>A 2023 survey commissioned by the organisation found that 81% of respondents were not aware there were rehabilitation programs for agricultural workers who were injured in an accident and 61% did not think there were transparent career pathways for agricultural workers with a disability. It also found that 72% of employers said they would modify or adapt their workplaces to make them more accessible – and that number rose to 80% if there were grants or subsidies available.</p> <p>The federal government administers the <a href=\"https://www.jobaccess.gov.au/employment-assistance-fund-eaf\">employment assistance fund</a> to aid workplaces make modifications but Clarke says a lack of clear information about the grant criteria leads to 80% of people with disabilities funding adaptations themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/07/beer-bread-and-beyond-the-mind-blowing-potential-of-australias-mountain-rye-and-other-perennial-grains\">Beer, bread and beyond: the ‘mind-blowing’ potential of Australia’s mountain rye and other perennial grains</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“People may want to modify stockyards, for example, and don’t think that would be covered by a grant,” she says. Self-funding adaptations “can lead to people leaving agriculture because of financial restraints”.</p> <p>Ability Agriculture publishes an accessibility checklist for agricultural events and businesses. It also sponsors young people with disabilities to take part in agricultural shows and hosted a seminar with SafeWork NSW in Wagga Wagga in October on adapting in agriculture, which provided an opportunity for people with disabilities to talk about their experiences in the industry.</p> <p>“It creates a space for businesses to come and ask questions and that’s really important in building disability confidence in the industry,” Clarke says.</p> <p>She says technological improvements and a more inclusive approach from industry could make agriculture a more welcoming place to those with disabilities.</p> <p>“One thing I learned from Dad being in a wheelchair was that it was OK to be vulnerable and it’s OK to be frustrated when you can’t do certain things,” she says. “Together we can figure out a different way to do them.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Mandy McKeesick is a writer from central Queensland</em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter</a></em></p></li> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/guardianaustraliaruralnetwork\">Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community</a></em></p></li> </ul>",

They call those discretionary purchases, or impulse buys – things like chips, and other junk food.”</p> <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics has conducted research showing how much supermarket promotions can affect purchases, with sales of discounted products increasing by many factors from their typical level.</p> <p>While consumers typically spend five times as much on a product when it is discounted, in some instances this can escalate much higher.</p> <p>Guardian Australia analysis of the ABS research found consumer expenditure increased 70-fold when a premium brand of olive oil was discounted.</p> <p>The ABS data, retrieved from supermarket scanner figures collated by the agency, provides an insight into shoppers’ attraction to promoted items, which is even more exaggerated during times of rising living costs.</p> <p>Jana Bowden, a professor of marketing at Macquarie University, said a limited quantity of discounted products puts consumers into a temporary state of psychological limbo by creating an irrational sense of fear of missing out.</p> <p>“We are manipulated by these tactics because our behaviour is driven by our pre-existing goals,” Bowden said.</p> <p>“If our goal is to save money, then seeing a deal makes us feel good, and that in turn operates as a reward signal. It’s a domino effect.”</p> <h2>The temptation of treats</h2> <p>Woolworths is Australia’s biggest supermarket chain, slightly ahead of rival Coles. Combined, the chains control about two-thirds of the market, although that rises to 90% in some locations where there is limited competition.</p> <p>Promotions are usually funded through an agreement between a supermarket and food manufacturer, with multinationals that sell less healthy items usually wielding the biggest marketing budgets.</p> <p>Promotional activities will feature in the upcoming parliamentary inquiry, according to the terms of reference, which is scheduled to start its public hearings early this year.</p> <p>Cameron said the upcoming scrutiny on supermarkets gave policymakers an opportunity to look at junk food marketing, given rules in Australia lag those imposed in comparative markets.</p> <p>UK regulations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/03/supermarkets-in-england-blatantly-disregarding-rules-over-where-they-place-crisps-sweets-and-fizzy-drinks\">restrict promotions and govern store placement</a> for foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt or sugar.

Here are four.</p> <h2>‘Deportation, Mr Djokovic’</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2024/jan/15/australias-greatest-sporting-moment-poll-entry\">Australia’s greatest sporting moment poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Novak Djokovic could not have picked a worse time to pack his bags, log on to Instagram and announce he was heading to Melbourne. In early 2022 the city was so divided, with Covid case numbers in the tens of thousands. Melburnians were so worn down that a mass brawl broke out at a supermarket, with one shopper whacked over the head with a saucepan. Then Novak sauntered in with his wacky ideas on vaccination, his sloppy paperwork, his 20 grand slams and hundreds of millions of tennis earnings. He didn’t have a prayer.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/jan/10/how-novak-djokovics-visa-controversy-has-unfolded-so-far-video\">saga over medical exemptions, visa bungles and entry permissions</a> dragged on and on. The smirking mug of “No-Vax” led the news every night. His supporters were singing Balkan folk songs outside his hotel. His visa appeal was a circus. The live streaming was bedevilled by lengthy dropouts, porn, spamming and bootlegging.</p>    <p>The Guardian’s Jonathan Liew noted how Djokovic treated it all like a tennis match, “with an unshakeable and messianic belief in his own supremacy. He contested his deportation as if it were a crucial break point – as if it were his last stand against total oblivion.” The problems, Liew wrote, “arise when you begin to conflate the hard, white lines of the tennis court with the messy compromises of the world at large”.</p> <h2>Essendon go the jab</h2> <p>It was driven “by incompetence rather than malevolence”, according to Chip Le Grand in his book The Straight Dope. That’s being generous. The Essendon supplements scandal enmeshed a prime minister in an election year, the most powerful and defensive sporting organisation in the country, mysterious new drugs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/23/afl-essendon-supplements-scandal-explained\">warnings of susceptibility to organised crime</a>, an underfunded peak anti-doping body, a haughty AFL boss, a rabid press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/26/afl-essendon-stephen-dank-banned-for-life\">controversial sports scientists</a>, senior bureaucrats, crack silks, human rights experts, golden boys, conspiracy theorists and flag wavers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2024/jan/19/cathy-freemans-2000-gold-was-a-landmark-in-every-measure-of-australias-history\"> Cathy Freeman’s 2000 gold was a landmark in every measure of Australia’s history | Jonathan Horn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a perfect sporting shitstorm and the scandal needed a face. For months, it was James Hird’s ashen visage plastered all over the front and back pages. The AFL, as always, sought to control the narrative. Essendon countered with anaesthetic press releases and lame hashtags. The natural inclination, whether you were a columnist, a tweeter, a keyboard thumper or a water cooler bore, was to take as strident a stance as possible. It netted some Walkley awards. It cost others Brownlow medals. It sent some mad and drove others from the sport. Few can explain with any clarity what the hell actually took place. Essendon has never been the same since.</p>    <h2>Fine Cotton is subbed out</h2> <p>There had always been ring-ins in horse racing. In the 1970s a gentleman named Rick Renzella – who the journalist Andrew Rule called “a man of many parts, most of them stolen” – orchestrated a series of successful stings. The key, Renzella realised, was that the nags had to vaguely resemble one another. But the Fine Cotton/Bold Personality ring-in was a misbegotten shambles. It featured a cast of chancers, charlatans and crackpots, most of whom were untroubled by intellectual concerns. For a start, Bold Personality was a full shade lighter and half a furlong quicker than Fine Cotton. He also had a big white star on his forehead. The application of dye and peroxide didn’t help. A half-smart sixth grader could have concocted a more effective scam.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/18/ash-bartys-2022-australian-open-win-was-a-defining-moment-for-blak-women-in-sport\">Ash Barty’s 2022 Australian Open win was a defining moment for blak women in sport | Laura Murphy-Oates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What’s fascinating about the Fine Cotton affair is that it was never fully explained or resolved. The Waterhouse family, while not accused of being involved in the ring-in itself, were found to have prior knowledge of the switch. Bill Waterhouse, Rule wrote, was “a liar, cheat and a bully”. When he and his son Robbie were found to have known about the ring-in they were “warned off” every racetrack in the world. But the Sydney racing world forgives all trespasses and Robbie eventually returned to bookmaking. Big Bill himself, with a straight face, a nice turn of phrase and not a shred of shame, published a book What are the Odds? and took his truth to the grave in 2019. Robbie went on to marry wife, Gai, who’s horses won all over the world, and his son Tom’s ads constituted approximately 75% of all advertising on Australian television.</p> <h2>The underarm incident</h2> <p>The little girl tugged on Greg Chappell’s arm. “You cheated!” she cried. “You cheated!” On an atrocious MCG pitch, in 41C heat, he’d made 90 and bowled 10 overs. Now, with one ball remaining in the limited overs clash against New Zealand,the series all square and the Kiwis needing a six to force a replay, the Australian captain sat on his haunches at mid-off. The spectators – adhering to the MCG’s two-slab maximum and living in a pre-ozone layer world – were having a whale of a time. But Chappell was in complete mental disarray. He was craving a day off. He later called his biography Fierce Focus. At that moment he was focused on two things – rest and the brick outhouse making his way to the crease.</p> <p>Brian McKechnie was a double All Black, having represented New Zealand in rugby league and rugby union. As a batsman, he made a good fullback. But he was a big lad. If anyone was going to hit a six, Chappell convinced himself, it was this bloke. He asked his brother Trevor: “How are you at bowling your underarms?”</p>    <p>It was the sort of thing you could only ask a younger brother. Trevor was no world beater but he rolled a nice grubber. McKechnie flung his bat in disgust and all hell broke loose. The New Zealand prime minister called it “an act of true cowardice and I consider it appropriate the Australian team were wearing yellow”. In the dressing shed, Mark Burgess threw his teacup against the wall – a very Kiwi tantrum. Greg Chappell retreated to his hotel bolthole, slept properly for the first time in months and was booed into the SCG several days later. He then received a standing ovation after his match-winning 87.</p>",

And the show has garnered an average of <a href=\"https://variety.com/vip/the-power-of-tiktok-on-taylor-swift-eras-tour-1235752739/\">380m views a day on TikTok</a>, owing to the endless neatly packaged loops of the tour so far. </p> <p>I have tried to avoid them all.</p> <p>For Swifties in Australia, 2024 is really just the beginning of the Eras tour. Shows start back up again in early February in Tokyo, then move on to Melbourne and Sydney.</p> <p>For me the past 10 months have been an exciting yet excruciating battle of self-control. My naivety, in hindsight, didn’t predict how overwhelmed the media would be by Swift – dating the NFL star Travis Kelce, Time’s person of the year, her sexuality in the spotlight. And while everyone else has reached saturation point with her as a topic, I’ve been avoiding as many articles and videos as possible. No easy feat.</p> <p>You see, terrified of spoiling (arguably) the greatest live performance of my generation, I decided last year to forgo reading the 44-song set list and forbade myself from watching anything on social media.</p> <p>It’s been a tough time.</p> <p>The real exercise of self-constraint started right after that dreadful week in June 2022 when tickets went on sale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/jan/12/taylor-swift-green-little-lies-dress-58-pounds-scottish-designer\">Taylor Swift’s £58 dress choice leaves Scottish designer ‘gobsmacked’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Never seen Taylor Swift live before? Overwhelmingly, Eras was the only time to do it, which meant buying tickets was one of the most stressful times of my life. I wasn’t just competing with other super fans – I was competing with almost everyone, and their aunt, uncle, mother, and friend of a friend who only discovered All Too Well through Sadie Sink.</p> <p>By that point I’d proudly logged off TikTok. Goodbye algorithms, hello productivity. But on what I thought was the safer app of Instagram disobedient reels started popping up with sparkly bodysuits, split-second stage-dives and cruel summer intros.</p>    <p>Then the fear really set in: how was I going to make it through months without seeing anything Eras-tour related?</p> <p>My iPhone’s volume. I might not be able to control visuals but I can control volume, which now remains almost always off whenever I am on Instagram, for fear of ruining the set list and surprise songs – oh how I wish to go back to when I didn’t even know that was a thing. Sadly too many cocktails with a friend will reveal Eras secrets.</p> <p>Now, I must preface that my friends have (jokingly) respected my more than a decade-long obsession with Swift. They semi-get where I am coming from.</p> <p>They have listened to me retell the story of my 16-year-old self weeping beside Andrea Swift – the singer’s mum, for those who don’t know – after a friend and I were selected from the crowd of her Sydney Red concert in 2013, to be The Lucky Ones and join a VIP section. Taylor, with her transitional straight blond hair and red and white sequined costume, high-fived me, with my fearlessly loyal curls and 22 inspired T-shirt, as she went by.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/12/why-obsess-over-taylor-swifts-sexuality-when-there-are-more-openly-queer-musicians-than-ever\">Why obsess over Taylor Swift’s sexuality when there are more openly queer musicians than ever? | Rebecca Shaw </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Friends get why I would want to try to replicate a sliver of surprise at her show, when the above moment was one of the most shockingly surprising moments of my little life.</p> <p>But then came the texts from friends who wanted to see the Eras movie with me. They were overjoyed I’d managed to win the Swift lottery and snag tickets but also wanted me to ruin the entire show by going to the cinemas to pre-watch it? I’d entered an unexpected danger zone, and politely declined to multiple sources. I’d made it this far.</p> <p>When I told a colleague about my set list goal she was shocked. She absolutely needed to know the entire concert so she could carefully plan a toilet break and not miss out on anything huge. I felt a nostalgic pang in my bladder from when I couldn’t dare leave the mosh at a Dua Lipa concert. I hadn’t thought about the dreaded toilet break … would I be able to hold on?</p> <p>Now I am writing with only six weeks to go and I still don’t know the full, ordered set list. I know more then I would’ve hoped but I am proud of how far I’ve come.</p> <p>Because still not knowing what Swift will say, about which song and when, is how I have entered all her concerts since I was 13.</p> <p>It’s something I don’t want to risk not feeling.</p>",

I use the example of parenthood – we know the incidence of peri- or postnatal depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges that can come along with becoming a parent are more likely to impact this age group, relative to other age groups,” Hitchcock said.</p> <p>Hitchcock said the elevated mental health difficulties of women during the pandemic could indicate they took on more of a burden at home, with other research demonstrating that new mothers were particularly affected by the pandemic.</p> <p>The study’s findings which show that women and LGBTQ+ people were more vulnerable reflects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/05/abs-national-study-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-report-results-released-young-people-australia-bureau-statistics\">data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> and previous research that showed patterns of poor mental health in these groups even before the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/30/chloe-is-happy-living-with-her-parents-but-staying-at-home-longer-hurts-some-australians-mental-health-report-finds\">Chloe is happy living with her parents – but staying at home longer hurts some Australians’ mental health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors acknowledge the limitation of the study’s sample not being representative of the Australian young adult population, as well as the lack of pre-pandemic data limiting the understanding of whether Covid necessarily caused any worsening in mental health.</p> <p>Georgia Evans, now 19, said her feelings of depression and anxiety began around the pandemic, at the same time as she started exploring her identity and sexuality. Evans, who uses she/they pronouns, came to identify with the LGBTQ+ community in 2021.</p> <p>“I didn’t really have a support system to work through that with. I was … struggling to accept myself in the beginning, and I was confused about how other people were going to accept me as well,” she said.</p> <p>Evans said her friends proved to be supportive when she came out to them, and her symptoms of anxiety and depression have since improved. But she adds: “I’m still dealing with the ongoing repercussions, still trying to get a good work-life balance. I want to get back to studying at some point.”</p> <p>Luke Mitchell, who is a peer leader at the mental health charity Youth Insearch alongside Fogg, said it was important for young people in the LGBTQ+ community to be connected with each other. The vulnerability of queer people to mental health problems during the pandemic was exacerbated by the lack of social interactions during lockdowns, Mitchell said.</p> <p>Linda Williams, the clinical lead at youth mental health organisation ReachOut, said young adults often experienced financial challenges and, for those under 25, the brain was still developing, leading to challenges in terms of relationships and social development.</p> <p>“It’s important to realise that it’s not like you turn 18, and you’ve magically got everything all sorted.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, the crisis support service <a href=\"https://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> is 13 11 14.

It rests on two theories: that Baldwin either caused Hutchins’ death as an “involuntary manslaughter by negligent use of a firearm”, or as involuntary manslaughter “without due caution or circumspection” – a charge that will require prosecutors to prove that Baldwin caused Hutchins’ death as “an act committed with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others”.</p>    <p>“We look forward to our day in court,” the actor’s attorneys, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, said in an email to <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/santa-fe-grand-jury-indicts-alec-baldwin-on-new-manslaughter-charge/article_05b5bc9a-b700-11ee-b312-77b2f98dec41.html\">the Santa Fe New Mexican</a>.</p> <p>According to legal experts, the indictment gives prosecutors an opportunity to win a conviction based on Baldwin’s obligations as a co-producer on the film.</p> <p>“We don’t know exactly what their theory is,” John Day, a Santa Fe-based defense attorney and former prosecutor, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/grand-jury-indictment-alec-baldwin-opens-paths-prosecutors-106534541\">told ABC News.</a> “It could be that they’re including his role as basically CEO of the production … not having a safe workplace and somebody dies and you’re at the top of the pyramid.”</p> <p>Rust Movie Productions, the company behind the film, paid a $100,000 fine to state workplace safety regulators after a report into safety failures included testimony that managers of the production took limited or no action after there were two earlier gun misfires on set.</p> <p>The Santa Fe county sheriff, Adan Mendoza, noted soon after the accident that 500 rounds of ammunition – a mix of blanks, dummy rounds and suspected live rounds – were found.</p> <p>The film resumed production in Montana last year, 18 months after it was halted following Hutchins’ death.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Rahmani said in an email to the Guardian that Baldwin’s advantage could be that “jurors love celebrities, and that’s why celebs are often acquitted at a higher percentage than other members of the public”, but also disadvantaged because “prosecutors also like to go after celebrities and make a name for themselves”.</p> <p>The charges against Baldwin follow charges against Rust’s assistant director, David Halls, and the film’s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. Halls pleaded no contest to a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for six months of probation. Gutierrez-Reed is scheduled to go to trial next month.</p> <p>Court filings made public on Friday indicate that the Rust prop master, Sarah Zachry, has signed an agreement to cooperate with special prosecutors in return for leniency.</p> <p>Los Angeles litigator and defense attorney Kate Mangels told ABC that Baldwin’s defense team will probably watch Gutierrez-Reed’s trial closely for clues to prosecutors’ strategy and the testimony of witnesses who are also likely to be called in their client’s case.</p> <p>“It could offer a preview of the prosecution’s approach and potential witness testimony,” Mangels said.</p> <p>It is believed Hutchins’ death was caused when live rounds and dummy ammunition were mixed up on the set. Baldwin initially claimed the gun had gone off after the pulled back the hammer but not the trigger, a claim that is subject to competing theories about the gun and its condition that now look set to be tested at trial.</p> <p>In October, prosecutors looking at the case said additional facts had come to light that the state believed showed Baldwin could have “criminal culpability” in Hutchins’ death and Souza’s wounding.</p> <p>Baldwin’s indictment, said Los Angeles attorney Miguel Custodio, “is one more factor that will accelerate the trend in Hollywood of phasing out real guns on set”.</p> <p>Custodio predicted that whatever the outcome of Baldwin’s prosecution, insurance companies “will have to assess the risk of another tragedy if real guns are used on any set” and that the “public backlash from this case is making guns on sets less acceptable”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The full-time whistle blows at the Emirates: the trigger for roughly 400 coaches, stewards, broadcasters, support staff and various other items of football’s background scenery to swarm the pitch. Roy Hodgson folds his glasses into a coat pocket and stands on the touchline, gazing bleakly out into the maelstrom, looking – as he often does these days – like a man reminiscing about a sandwich he once had in 1962. A cameraman spots the opportunity for the perfectly framed shot; he wheels around Hodgson and captures him from behind, staring out at a distant banner in the Crystal Palace end:</p> <p>WASTED POTENTIAL </p> <p>ON AND OFF THE PITCH </p> <p>WEAK DECISIONS </p> <p>TAKING US BACKWARDS</p> <p>The natural tendency here, at least for the professional storyteller, is to superimpose some kind of human narrative on this confected tableau, to peer inside Hodgson’s brain and empty its contents on to the page. Was he contemplating the end? Wondering whether this great weathered career had finally run its course? Perhaps even absorbing one last ray of footballing daylight, making one last memory, before disappearing down the tunnel and into the sweet embrace of oblivion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/20/roy-hodgson-understands-frustration-and-anger-of-crystal-palace-supporters\">Roy Hodgson ‘understands frustration and anger’ of Crystal Palace supporters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alas, no. “I was waiting for the players to come off the pitch,” he said when asked what was going through his mind at the time. Which for Hodgson is of course an immaculately, flawlessly on-brand response. He has frequently admitted that there is a streak of arrogance to him, and the idea of being decrypted or read – the idea that you, a person who is not Roy Hodgson, could ever truly comprehend the mind of Roy Hodgson – seems positively to offend him. In any case, if he really had been reflecting on something poignant and meaningful, he would scarcely have deigned to share it with the likes of us.</p> <p>In the current Premier League coaching landscape, with its cast of therapists and televangelists, this kind of thing stands out a lot more than it used to. Hodgson has no interest in feeding you sugar‑coated bromides or taking you on a magnificent journey. He’s not trying to tell you a story or sell you a vision. He doesn’t even really buy into one of football’s most sacrosanct lies: that fans are the cherished lifeblood of the game whose whims and motivations must never be questioned, let alone challenged. “They wouldn’t understand why I took Eze off the field,” he said of the fiesta of boos that greeted his decision to take Eberechi Eze off in Wednesday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/17/everton-crystal-palace-fa-cup-third-round-replay-match-report\">FA Cup defeat at Everton</a>.</p>    <p>All of which is probably going to get Hodgson sacked sooner rather than later. The wins have dried up – just one in all competitions since the start of October. The football is in gentle decline. A lot of the thrust and energy has gone out of the machine, and a Hodgson team without thrust and energy is basically indistinguishable from a square dance.</p> <p>Most crucially the fans have had enough, and at this juncture it is no kind of defence at all to argue that Palace are still well on track to stay up, particularly when you factor in the weakness of the three promoted teams and the possibility of points deductions to Everton and Nottingham Forest. Nor is it worth pointing out that this is their 11th consecutive season of Premier League football, a period during which they have never finished in the bottom five or gained fewer than 40 points, and that in historical terms means we are basically living through a Palace golden age.</p> <p>None of this really matters. Football, at the popular level, is not really an empirical exercise but a torrent of feelings, and the sense of staleness and stasis that has set in at Selhurst Park is not the kind of thing you can really argue your way out of. Particularly when you have a genial but frequently grouchy manager who, in his more unguarded moments, describes the fans as “spoiled”, grumbles that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/i-am-absolutely-sick-roy-hodgson-laws-refereeing-crystal-palace-liverpool\">“won’t miss anything”</a> when he’s gone, and when asked what his message is to the players after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/20/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">a humbling 5-0 defeat</a>, responds with the simple, uplifting words: “They’ve got to stick with the work they have been doing.”</p> <p>And frankly, if Palace’s board pull the lever on Hodgson now, then nobody can have too many complaints. Here the defending at set pieces was abysmal, the attacking strategy threadbare, the space available in behind the Palace defence – well before the two late counterattacks from which Gabriel Martinelli scored – the sort of thing that makes opposition analysts pause the tape and hunt feverishly for a notebook.</p> <p>But consider, too, that this is a squad that has had precious little investment or refreshment over the past few years, forcing Hodgson to spend the last few months negotiating a cataclysmic injury crisis. The experience and invention of Wilfried Zaha has been inadequately replaced. And what is often described as a “long-term build” looks a lot like a disparate ownership that, with one eye on a potential sale, has begun to abandon ambition for stasis.</p> <p>Afterwards, Hodgson is asked whether he still has the support of the board, and of course he knows what the question is really about. “In the scenario you’re envisaging,” he said, rolling the “r” with relish, “that has to be a question for them, hasn’t it?” And there’s a little smile there: as if the only thing worse than being sacked is having to&nbsp;explain himself.</p>",

          "fields" : {
            "body" : "<p>When the mid-60s oeuvre of the Shangri-Las is discussed, attention often focusses on the input of their producer, George “Shadow” Morton. You can see why. From the moment you dropped the needle on the New York City girl group’s first hit, 1964’s Remember (Walking in the Sand), Morton’s production style was hard to ignore. Working, so he claimed, without any experience or musical ability, he was not a man at home with subtlety or good taste. He drenched everything in echo and slathered on dramatic sound effects: screaming gulls and crashing waves, thunderclaps, the whistle and clatter of departing trains, the squeal of tyres and the crunch of vehicles colliding at speed.</p> <p>Perhaps Morton thought you needed to stand out in a US pop world that had just been turned on its head – Remember (Walking in the Sand) was recorded a few months after the Beatles’ first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show and released into a Hot 100 where the British invasion was in full swing: six singles by the Beatles, two by the Rolling Stones and the Dave Clarke 5, hits for the Searchers, the Animals, Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield – in which case his plan worked. Remember (Walking in the Sand) was the first in a string of Shangri-Las hits over the next two years.</p> <p>But the Shangri-Las’ de facto leader, Mary Weiss, who sang lead on all but one of the band’s hits, managed to stand out amid the sonic bedlam. She and her bandmates – her sister Betty and identical twins Marge and Mary Ann Ganser – had been discovered singing together at talent shows and school hops in the city, but it wasn’t until they hooked up with Morton that their singles clicked.</p> <p>Weiss was 15 when Remember (Walking in the Sand) was recorded, and looked rather sweet: blonde and possessed of an “angelic little face”, as songwriter Ellie Greenwich put it. But her voice told a different story. It was hard and piercing and a little nasal, a sound capable of cutting through Morton’s more-is-more productions. It was audibly the product of Queens (“I’m wokkin’ out that dohr!” she cries on Never Again), albeit a nicer neighbourhood than you might have imagined from listening to her.</p> <p>She had quite an emotional range – distraught on Never Again, stoical on The Train from Kansas City, sweetly lovestruck on Heaven Only Knows, consumed with lust at the end of Give Him a Great Big Kiss – but always sounded tough and streetwise: far from the matching gowns worn by her fellow girl groups, you somehow got the feeling she might be chewing gum or filing her nails as she sang. Perhaps that lent her voice a certain realism that accounts for the emotional impact of the Shangri-Las’ singles.</p> <p>The arrangements were high camp and the lyrical teen melodramas could become faintly ridiculous – on 1965’s Give Us Your Blessings, a lovestruck couple meet their end in a car crash, so blinded by tears at their parents’ refusal to let them marry that they don’t see a road-closed sign – but they almost always packed an emotional punch regardless. They were, the critic Greil Marcus once noted, “records [that] left wounds in their listeners”: Amy Winehouse called their 1965 single I Can Never Go Home Anymore “the saddest song in the world”.</p>    <p>Certainly, Weiss’s voice was the perfect vehicle for the Shangri-Las’ oeuvre, in which parents were defied, unsuitable boyfriends were relentlessly pursued (“he’s good-bad, but he’s not <em>evil</em>,” shrugged Weiss in response to an inquiry about her sweetheart’s character on Give Him a Great Big Kiss) and people died horribly: usually, although not always, in road accidents. “Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out!” screamed Weiss as biker beau Jimmy sped angrily off into the night, and to a grisly fate, on their extraordinary 1964 No 1 Leader of the Pack: should anyone have wondered what exactly became of him, Morton was on hand with his sound effects to underline the point.</p> <p>They weren’t the first girl group to lust after a wrong ’un – the Crystals had a huge hit with He’s a Rebel in 1962 – nor the first to suggest they were rather more steely and tough than the matching outfits suggested: the Angels’ New Jersey-born vocalist Peggy Santiglia sounded not unlike Weiss on 1963’s My Boyfriend’s Back, the perfect fit for a song that essentially spends two minutes warning someone that the titular boyfriend is going to beat the shit out of them. But the Shangri-Las made parent-baiting toughness their raison d’être, shifting the dial of what was permissible from girls in pop in the process.</p> <p>Their bad boys weren’t really misunderstood like the hero of He’s a Rebel, they were attractive precisely because they were bad. “Dirty fingernails!” Weiss sings, delighted on Give Him a Great Big Kiss. “Oh boy, what a prize!” Their worldview might be best summed up by 1965’s Out in the Streets, a big ballad on which Weiss announces that her love has tamed her former gang-member boyfriend. Rather than express satisfaction at this turn of events, she’s distraught: “He don’t do the wild things that he did before,” she complains. “He don’t wear those dirty old black boots no more … I wish I’d never met him.”</p> <p>There’s something telling about the fact that their hit-making career drew to an end with 1966’s Long Live Our Love, on which they were required to salute a boyfriend conscripted to fight in Vietnam to the strains of When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again: “Something’s come between us and it’s not another girl / But a lot of people need you – there is trouble in the world.” It wasn’t just that releasing a patriotic, ostensibly pro-war song was a questionable idea in 1966, although it was: the anti-war movement and the counterculture alike were burgeoning. It was that the song seemed so antithetical to the image the Shangri-Las had built up over the preceding couple of years: the lyrics, the leather outfits, the stories about Weiss carrying a gun, or getting in a fight with police after using a bathroom designated for black women at a segregated Texas venue where they were supporting James Brown, or indeed about Marvin Gaye being nearly brained backstage at Brooklyn’s Fox theatre after wandering out of his dressing room straight into the Shangri-Las “letting off steam” by throwing crockery at each other. What were they doing meekly waving their sweetheart off, rather than smuggling him across the border to Canada? And who was this sweetheart anyway? Surely The Shangri-Las should have been drooling after a long-haired draft-card-burner?</p> <p>Whatever the reason, that was more or less it for their career, although they had one more extraordinary record in them. Essentially a spoken-word monologue with a musical accompaniment based on Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, Past, Present and Future could be read as yet another song about a failed teenage romance, but between the portentous strings and Weiss’s soft, understated delivery lurks the implication that the problem isn’t merely being dumped, that something far worse has happened to the protagonist: “Take a walk along the beach tonight? / I’d love to / But don’t try to touch me / Don’t try to touch me / Because that will never happen again.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01YePzk29Mc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/01YePzk29Mc?start=3&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>The Shangri-Las: Give Him a Great Big Kiss (live in 1965) – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Perhaps understandably, a song that seemed to suggest its protagonist had been abused or raped failed to restore their fortunes and the Shangri-Las faded away: Weiss eventually went to work for an architectural firm. But their music declined to follow suit, despite presumably being intended as no more than disposable teen pop. The Leader of the Pack was a hit again in the UK in 1972, and again four years later. Not entirely unpredictably, they became the girl group of choice among the denizens of proto-punk and punk itself. The New York Dolls swiped Weiss’s sneering spoken-word intro to Give Him a Great Big Kiss – “when I say I’m in love, you best believe I’m in love – L-U-V” – for the opening of 1973’s Looking for a Kiss and, disastrously, employed Shadow Morton as the producer of their second album, Too Much Too Soon. The first British punk single, New Rose by the Damned, began with singer Dave Vanian asking: “Is she really going out with him?”, a line stolen from the spoken-word intro of Leader of the Pack. Their influence hung over Blondie, who covered Out in the Streets, and paid homage to their sound on their debut single, X Offender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/16/popandrock1\">The leader of the comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, punk-era interest led to a brief Shangri-Las reformation – they played a solitary gig at CBGBs, backed by a band that included Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye, and started work on a new album which was left unfinished. Nevertheless, by the mid-80s, they were being hailed as an influence by the Jesus and Mary Chain and covered by glam metal band Twisted Sister. Amy Winehouse was a huge fan – interpolating live performances of Back to Black with lines from Remember (Walking in the Sand) – and so, apparently, were Abba: Agnetha Fältskog covered Past, Present and Future on her 2004 album My Colouring Book. In fact, Shangri-Las fandom is the linking factor between some unlikely artists: Lana Del Rey, Sonic Youth and Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour; Bette Midler and Belle and Sebastian.</p> <p>Eventually Weiss broke cover, releasing a well-received solo album, Dangerous Game, in 2007. She gave a few interviews, which didn’t reveal much – journalists struggled to square the middle-class professional they met with the voice of Out in the Streets or Give Him a Great Big Kiss. Perhaps it was an act all along, but it doesn’t really matter either way: Mary Weiss’s voice still cut through.</p>",

The 19-year-old arrives having made 35 first-team appearances for Boca.</p> <p>David Weir, the club’s technical director, said of the Argentinian: “We have been aware of Valentín for a long time and have been impressed with the progress he has made at domestic and international level.</p> <p>“We’re delighted to welcome him to the club, and we are looking forward to seeing how he progresses and develops under Roberto [De Zerbi]. He has played predominantly on the left side, as a full-back, wing-back or winger, but also shown his versatility with Boca, playing across the midfield.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A few hours after his second-round match on Thursday at the Australian Open, Alexander Zverev conducted his mandatory press conference. The only English question posed to him was related not to his victory but a rather more pressing issue: whether he would be attending his trial in May for domestic abuse in person.</p> \n<p>Zverev was visibly disgusted: “Wow,” he said. “That’s a question. I just played four hours, 40 minutes. That’s not the first question I really want to hear, to be honest. I’ve got no idea.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/20/iga-swiatek-loses-unseeded-teenager-linda-noskova-at-australian-open-2024-tennis\">Iga Swiatek stunned by unseeded teenager Noskova at Australian Open</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Monday, a day before his first-round match in Melbourne, the Tiergarten district court in Berlin announced that Zverev would undertake a public trial.</p> \n<p>In October, Zverev was issued a penalty order and fined €450,000 for allegations of him physically abusing a woman, his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, and “damaging her health” during an argument in Berlin in May 2020.</p> \n<p>In Germany, a penalty order carries the option for the accused to contest the charge, with a public trial likely to follow. Zverev denies the charge and he accordingly lodged an objection.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, the ATP announced Zverev as a new member of the ATP player council, which is voted for by other players. In Melbourne, those peers have maintained a wall of silence when asked whether Zverev is an appropriate representative for them on the council.</p> \n<p>Stefanos Tsitsipas said he does not know the situation: “I’m completely unfamiliar with it. I have nothing to comment on it,” he said. Cameron Norrie said that it is “tough to comment” since he did not know details of the case.</p> \n<p>Asked whether it would be appropriate for him to remain on the council in light of his impending trial, Zverev responded: “Why would it not be?” He also said that he does not have a “reason not to believe” that he still has the support of the players.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, some on the WTA tour have been more forthcoming. While Iga Swiatek, the world No 1, said she does not know the full history of Zverev’s cases and so not in position to judge, she also noted: “I think it’s up to the ATP what they decide. For sure it’s not good when a player who’s facing charges like that is kind of being promoted.”</p> \n<p>Sloane Stephens, who was previously a member of the WTA player council, said: “The ATP beats their own drum. They do what they do on that side. Would that happen on the WTA Tour? Probably not.”</p> \n<p>Daria Kasatkina, an outspoken Russian, said: “That’s what I expected, unfortunately. For sure, there is an issue. In general, if there is a criminal [process] or something, I don’t think it’s the right thing to promote a person.”</p> \n<p>While Zverev wants his tennis to be the focus, the seriousness of his impending trial means this will continue to loom over the 26-year-old until it is resolved. While other sports, such as the NBA and NFL in the US, have constructed domestic abuse policies that would lead to the athlete being recused from the sport until legal matters are concluded, the ATP has none.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The small attention drawn at this grand slam is likely to be a fraction of what is to come. Zverev’s trial will intersect with some of the most significant dates on the tennis calendar. The trial is scheduled to begin on 31 May and continue over eight dates: 7, 11, 18 and 21 June, and 5, 12 and 19 July.</p> \n<p>The French Open takes place between 28 May and 11 June, and Wimbledon from 1-14 July, meaning Zverev’s trial is scheduled to intersect with both grand slam tournaments.</p> \n<p>There will doubtless be more uncomfortable questions to come.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Helen Oyeyemi, 39, was born in Nigeria and raised in London. One of Granta’s best young British novelists in 2013, she’s the author of 10 books, including <em>Mr Fox</em>, <em>Gingerbread</em> and <em>Peaces</em>, which was shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize for experimental fiction. Her new novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/parasol-against-the-axe-9780571366620\">Parasol Against the Axe</a> – </em>her first to be set in Prague, her home since 2014 – takes place during a weekend hen party involving a book whose text changes every time it’s opened. The Australian critic Beejay Silcox has called Oyeyemi “a bamboozler, a discombobulator, a peddler of perplexity… there are few writers who can match her creative glee”.<br><br><strong>Where did </strong><em><strong>Parasol </strong></em><em><strong>Against the Axe</strong></em><strong> begin?</strong><br>In other books. Being a writer isn’t my whole personality: when I packed up all my things and moved here, it was just where I wanted to live – as Helen, not as a writer, and not even really as a reader. But then I was given <em>Magic Prague</em>, a book by<strong> </strong>[Angelo Maria] Ripellino, this long, wonderful love letter to the city. Reading about the surrealists Breton and Apollinaire visiting the street next to mine, I saw I wasn’t an anomaly: a lot of people have become irrationally entwined with Prague out of the blue. Then when I read Vítězslav Nezval’s poems about the city, I knew I had to add to this body of work about Prague. But trying to persuade Prague to be written about wasn’t easy.<br><br><strong>What made it so challenging?</strong><br>Prague doesn’t want to be put into anyone’s story; so many people have come and tried to make it part of this or that empire, and it hasn’t worked. I had to say: “I’m not making a portrait of you, OK? I’m just going to tell some stories where you’re in the background.” The book began to form out of that negotiation. I felt almost at my limit with how much and how rapidly I was inventing, reeling off all this seemingly factual stuff with Borges-like conviction when it has no basis in actuality.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve looked at Amazon reviews. One said: 'How can a writer like this eat?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Did that feel different to how you usually work?</strong><br>I was nervous because I was addressing this place that I know I love when I don’t know how it feels about me. But that’s actually also how I feel about writing and literature: it’s what I want to do but I don’t know if I’m receiving any affection back! Every time I finish writing a book, I’m just like, OK, here come all the people running to say they don’t like it. Sometimes I’ve looked at Amazon reviews and there’s one that says: “How can a writer like this eat?”</p> <p><strong>The </strong><em><strong>Times Literary Supplement</strong></em><strong> likened the experience of reading </strong><em><strong>Peaces</strong></em><strong> to “babysitting an overindulged child”.</strong><br>A Czech friend was so delighted to show that to me. I prefer a nasty review if it’s built on some kind of understanding of the project’s parameters. When a negative Czech review of <em>Gingerbread</em> accused me of being obsessed with form over content, I felt seen. It sounds ungrateful but I prefer that to the kind of praise that’s like being patted on the head: “Oh, she does storytelling.” Well, yeah! I should hope so. Everybody writing fiction does that.<br><strong><br>A line in </strong><em><strong>Parasol </strong></em><em><strong>Against the Axe</strong></em><strong> says we can’t understand Prague without speaking Czech. How’s yours these days?</strong><br>I’ve already got enough on my plate with English! I can complain about a gas bill but living here has taught me to be OK with not really understanding that much or being understood, because I realised it translates to so many of my experiences in English as well. It’s weird being a human who likes other humans mediated through art; when actual humans are in front of me, I’m just like, nooo.<br><strong>Have you always felt that way?</strong><br>“When did you first realise you prefer people in art?!” Maybe reading José Saramago made me feel warm towards people. Also, watching <em>Doctor Who</em>: I love the idea of this alien, who actually has got nothing to do with us, consistently sticking up for humans. I’m like, “Why would you? <em>Why?”</em> But he can. It made me see things in a new light.<br><br><strong>As a reader, how do you know when a novel is for you?</strong><br>I avoid synopses: I just open the book and look at a few sentences to decide. Because – yes! – I <em>am</em> all about the way it’s told, not subject matter; anyone can tell me anything as long as they say it in a way I like. But that also makes me very impressionable in certain ways.<br><br><strong>So are there writers whose style you enjoy but who then leave you uncomfortable?</strong><br>Witold Gombrowicz [the 20th-century Polish author of <em>The Possessed</em>] is one. The sense of almost magnetic resistance as my mind is pushed and pushed makes for a really pleasurable reading experience, but I suspect the overall sentiment [of his work] is kind of hierarchical, where there are good and worthy people or states of being, and despicable ones to be ground under the heel; that’s not the way my own mind is organised. Kundera’s another. Sometimes he talks as if he looks down on people who watch a lot of TV. I’m like, “But that’s me!” And he’s like, “Yeah, you’re trashy minded.”<br><br><strong>What have you enjoyed reading recently?</strong><br>I had a lot of fun with <em>Practice</em> by Rosalind Brown [out in March, about a student writing an essay]. I think only she and Proust can get me into the space where I’m happy to read about someone walking across a room for all these pages. You’re reading about reading; you have to be really good to do that in a compelling way.<br><br><strong>Was there a book that inspired you to write?</strong><br>I talk about my moment with Ali Smith’s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hotel-world-9780140296792\">Hotel World</a></em> so much that I don’t want to embarrass her again. Just taking three days off sick from school to read it under the covers… the way it begins with an ending, ahhhhh!

The Tigers can still make the last 16 but will have to wait on the outcome of Sale’s match against La Rochelle to be sure. They can hardly argue, for all their industry, the Tigers were considerably short on imagination and Leinster had only to occasionally move through the gears to claim victory over Leicester for the third season in succession.</p> \n<p>It was an absorbing spectacle nonetheless, witnessed by a sell-out crowd at Welford Road, but if this is a harbinger for the Six Nations, as matches at this stage of the competition can be, Ireland are shaping up well considering all 15 of their starters have been named in Andy Farrell’s squad for the championship. They scored four tries – the consistently impressive Joe McCarthy scoring the first with Jordan Larmour, Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris adding the rest – ensuring another bonus point in a 100% pool stage record.

That was as good as it got for Tigers who failed to score a point thereafter. “I’m frustrated for [the players], I spoke about it being a Test match,” said Leicester’s head coach Dan McKellar. “The reality is we didn’t take opportunities at key moments and they did.”</p> \n<p>A Harry Byrne penalty in front of the posts got Leinster up and running but it was the excellence of Lowe that dragged last year’s losing finalists back into the match.

            "body" : "<p>Royal Mail could be allowed to end Saturday postal deliveries as part of Ofcom’s review into how the service may need to be reformed.</p> <p>Next week, Ofcom will publish a document outlining “potential options for the future of the universal postal service”.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ofcom said it would set out evidence and options on “how the universal postal service might need to evolve to more closely meet consumer needs”.</p> <p>They added: “We will be inviting views on this, not consulting on specific proposals.</p> <p>“It would ultimately be for the UK government and parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service.”</p> <p>In November, Royal Mail reported half-year losses of £319m.</p> <p>Ofcom <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2023/ofcom-to-produce-potential-options-for-the-future-of-the-universal-postal-service\">began examining options</a> to alter the universal service obligation (USO) in September.</p> <p>According to Ofcom, the USO requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week (Monday to Saturday) and parcels five days a week (Monday to Friday) to every address in the UK, “at affordable prices that are uniform throughout the UK”.</p> <p>Royal Mail has blamed the USO for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/05/first-class-uk-stamp-to-rise-by-15p-in-october\">rising stamp prices</a> and has been calling for urgent reform, one of which would be to reduce postal deliveries to five days a week – Monday to Friday only.</p> <p>However, last summer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/uk-government-reject-royal-mail-request-end-saturday-deliveries\">the government denied its request to stop delivering post on Saturdays</a> – a move which would have needed approval by MPs.</p> <p>Previously, Ofcom has said the move could save between £125m and £225m a year.</p> <p>Announcing the review, Ofcom said: “The last few years have demonstrated the importance of postal services, but the way people use them is changing, and we expect these trends to continue.”</p> <p>It added that the number of letters sent and received had declined 46% over the last decade, as people and businesses moved to digital alternatives. With the decline in the number of letters delivered each day it said “the cost of delivery is increasing”.</p> <p>This week, Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of Royal Mail’s owners, International Distribution Services, said in its trading statement: “With Ofcom due to publish options for the future of the universal service imminently, now is the time for urgent action.</p> <p>“We are doing all we can to transform, but it is simply not sustainable to maintain a delivery network built for 20bn letters when we are now only delivering 7bn.”</p> <p>In a letter from Seidenberg to Liam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade select committee, on 9 January he wrote: “Delivering the current universal service requirements – in a financially sustainable way – is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve as the mix and number of parcels and letters changes.”</p> <p>He added: “It is simply not sustainable to maintain a delivery network that was built for 20bn letters when we are now delivering only 7bn.”</p> <p>He suggested ways to “tackle this problem” including “significantly increasing prices, seeking a government subsidy, and/or reforming the universal service so that it is more reflective of the customer needs and market realities of today, not the needs of the past.”</p> <p>Last November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/royal-mail-fined-56m-by-uk-regulator-for-missing-delivery-targets\">Ofcom fined Royal Mail £5.6m</a> for failing to meet its first- and second-class delivery targets in the 2022-23 financial year.</p> <p>The regulator said at the time that Royal Mail missed the targets by a “significant and unexplained margin”, causing “considerable harm” to its customers.</p> <p>The company delivered more than a quarter of first-class post late. Only 74% of post arrived on time in the 2022-23 financial year, far below its statutory target of 93%.</p> <p>It also missed its target for second-class mail, delivering 91% on time compared with a target of 98.5%.</p> <p>Royal Mail has been contacted for comment.</p>",

Use. Repeat</em>.” Recovery relies on its own well-worn platitudes – rock bottom, one day at a time, “I’m X, and I’m an alcoholic.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/19/love-me-review-kristen-stewart-steven-yeun-sundance\">Love Me review – Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun explore love in oddball sci-fi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Outrun, the German director Nora Fingscheidt’s mesmeric adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-outrun-amy-liptrot-review-by-will-self\">Amy Liptrot’s 2016 memoir</a>, accepts such trite foundations as a point. Rona, played by a never-better Saoirse Ronan, has a familiar pattern of despair and renewal – broken relationships, destructive blackouts and blistering hangovers. Derailed by alcohol at age 30, she returns to Orkney, an archipelago of about 70 islands in the northest north of Scotland where she grew up, to find herself in sobriety. She is not the first to start this journey, and she won’t be the last.</p> <p>How Fingscheidt, working from a script co-written with Liptrot, renders this unglamorous process so beautifully, so specifically, and with such curiosity as to how a person learns to reconcile their past with their future, is a marvel to behold; The Outrun is the rare two-hour movie that made me forget to check the time. That it does so while avoiding the many cliches of the cinematic memoir adaptation – films that contort life’s sprawl into a clear arc of definitive scenes – is its own achievement, a testament to the source material and Ronan’s tremendous performance.</p> <p>And one drawing on every cinematic tool to approximate the experience of two lives: drunk and sober, city and country. The poles are evident from the jump, as footage of the seals from Orkney’s coast – the selkies of folklore, according to Rona in a voiceover that settles into the story – blends with her memories of clubbing in London. The first hour skitters through Rona’s psychological fragmentation, flipping liberally between the past and present (conveniently delineated by Rona’s hair, which she has a penchant for dying bright colors).</p> <p>There’s the routine circle of life on the Orkney farm run by her father (Stephen Dillane), an Englishman plagued by bipolar episodes since Rona’s birth; glimpses of her childhood reveal events that drove her soft-spoken mother (Saskia Reeves) to the mainland’s town, and to God. A job tracking the rare corn crake bird introduces her to new islanders and triggers memories of her biology master’s in London, of nights juiced with ecstasy, risk and the touch of her lost lover (I May Destroy You’s Paapa Essiedu). Of grief. A black eye, then a rehab program.</p> <p>It’s an incredibly effective portrait of a reeling mind, the visual language of intrusive thoughts and rabbit holes. Flashbacks accumulate like the bottles on Rona’s floor. There’s a familiar dread to her descent, as she confuses the repetitive loop of benders with freedom, extremity with living, and lashes out at anyone who tries to ground her. Sobriety would be the worst crime of all: boring. Flingscheidt stages Rona’s first few months in Orkney – gray, windswept, isolated – in great contrast to the vivid nightlife of London, memories of which are increasingly blotted, piecemeal and truncated by shame.</p> <p>And yet, as her story unravels, Orkney opens up; Rona moves even farther north, to the remote island of Papa Westray (population 70 or so), to weather the storm alone (but with wifi, and welcoming townspeople). The way Rona’s life is lightly yet still definitively shaped by the internet – tracking flights overhead and boats at sea, bombarded with her father’s mental illness via phone, telling her London friend on FaceTime that she’s better than she’s been in a long time – add to a convincing portrait of a real recovery.</p> <p>Not all of the choices work – I found an additional layer of animation more alienating than illuminative of Rona’s psyche, and the final swell a bit too grandiose – but the overall effect is startlingly visceral. Credit, too, to the remarkable sound design, which cuts between Rona’s headphones and Orkney’s pounding surf; electronic music and nature are wondrous intoxicants when you submit to them, Orkney and Hackney not so far apart.</p> <p>Ronan bridges the two seamlessly. She’s at once titanic and quiet, and utterly convincing even in the very difficult art of acting drunk. (Rona’s a believable mean one.) Recovery is a slog, and Ronan shows every note of it. Thankfully, The Outrun does not disavow the person she was before. The portrayal of her partying days doesn’t fall fully into the trope of smudged eyeliner and debauchery; the wonder that led her to dance open-armed in a night club crowd is the same that pulls her north, an instinct corrupted by alcohol but not inextricable from it. How do you hold on to the person who sought truth, connection, awe? How do you change? It’s cliche and truth: there’s no one answer, and I won’t forget watching Rona fumble toward it.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Outrun is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year</p></li> </ul>",

There was little outward dissent towards Hodgson but the sight of Graham Potter watching from the stands at the Emirates heightened the sense that alternatives are available.</p> <p>“It’s quite a detailed [message] and it’s aimed at probably everybody in the club, it seemed,” Hodgson said. “All I can say is that they are entitled to their opinion. I&nbsp;understand their frustration, anger and disappointment that things haven’t gone better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/jan/20/roy-hodgson-seems-cut-adrift-crystal-palace-gentle-decline-continues\">Roy Hodgson has few words to share as Palace’s gentle decline continues | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We can make our excuses that certain things have worked against us but the bottom line is that, if we are going to go forward and avoid relegation and do well, we need those fans with us. Hopefully we can do our best to keep them on board. We can only do that by winning matches and playing better than we did today.”</p> <p>A spate of injuries, the most costly of them affecting Michael Olise, have reduced Hodgson’s options and so has Jordan Ayew’s presence at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana. But a run of one win in 12 games, 10 in the league, raises longer-term questions and leaves Palace five points clear of the relegation zone having played more games than several of their rivals. There is a risk drift turns into something worse.</p>    <p>Asked if he had his board’s backing, Hodgson responded: “That’s a question for them isn’t it? If you’re asking me have I ever felt there is a lack of support from them, no I haven’t, they have been good. In the scenario you are envisaging, that has to be a question for them.”</p> <p>Mikel Arteta had far less to regret after a match that lifted Arsenal into third, two points shy of the leaders, Liverpool, having played a game more. He had faced questions of his own before their mini winter break but the outcome was never in doubt after Gabriel Magalhães’s 11th-minute opener. Arsenal have become set-piece wizards, topping the charts from corners and scoring their first two goals by that&nbsp;means.</p> <p>“We trained set pieces less in the last week than other aspects of the game, this is the beauty of it,” he said. “[I was] really pleased with the clean sheet, which is something that we’ve been lacking to win games. And sharing the goals as well, which I think is going to make a big impact on the team.“This is the second part of the season, and we want to tackle it with a lot of aggression and motivation.”</p> <p>Arteta confirmed Declan Rice and Gabriel both came off in the second half with discomfort, explaining there was no point taking risks given Arsenal’s winning position.</p>",

You get the drift. If you were a naughty geezer, getting your name on a <em>Gangster</em> series would be a sign you’ve definitely made it.</p> <p>This new series is slightly different.

And, yes, I realise that’s what phones do, but this particular £1,500 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/encrypted-messaging-system-used-procure-gun-encrochat\">EncroChat phone</a> can’t be bought in Carphone Warehouse. You can only get hold of an EncroChat phone if you have a friend in the criminal fraternity.</p> <p>The moment when Azhar acquires one (borrowed from the National Crime Agency) is great. It looks just like an ordinary Android phone, he says, and opens up exactly like one. But when he swipes down with his finger three times, the phone resets itself and another screen loads up with a messaging system. An EncroChat phone is simply the hardware for what Azhar calls: “A WhatsApp fraternity full of criminals.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>LBC listeners are red in tooth and claw, and it takes nous to know when to challenge and when to hold back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Exciting, right? But what’s even more exciting is that in 2020, French police managed to hack the EncroChat system. They sent a fake software update to all of the phones (60,000 users) and used it to get all of the messages. There were a lot. Thousands and thousands, all arriving at once. “It was like being in a room with them,” says one policeman. The French enlisted the Dutch and the British police forces, who worked 20 hours a day during lockdown, trying to make sense of the messages. The result? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/02/blow-for-uk-organised-as-command-and-control-network-is-hit\">The biggest organised crime bust in British policing history.</a></p> <p>This is a good yarn, and one of those rare true crime series that you don’t ever feel too scared or too icky about. The message-hacking leads to the arrest of a couple of violent wrong ’uns, plus a dodgy copper and his mate. Azhar even gets close to working out who actually created EncroChat. But the real delight is in the detective work, the working out who’s who from little clues in the messages, such as a picture of a girlfriend’s dog. Excellent.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/catchup/lbc/uk/b8FPjdd/\">Carol Vorderman</a></strong>, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/08/carol-vorderman-quits-bbc-show-social-media-rules\">quit her BBC Radio Wales show</a>, saying she would “not be silenced”, has been given her own slot on – surprise! – LBC. These days, any BBC presenter who’s politically opinionated on social media is almost certainly hopping over to Global. (The exception is Gary Lineker, who’s building his own podcasting house instead.) Vorderman has been given 4pm to 7pm on a Sunday, a cosy slot, though nothing on LBC is cosy, and her first show last Sunday wasn’t perfect but wasn’t bad.</p> <p>Her opening question was whether Rishi Sunak should have got parliament to vote on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/12/us-uk-houthi-strikes-attack-yemen-visual-guide\">UK bombing of Houthi military bases in Yemen</a>. The right topic, I think, and she handled her expert guests pretty well, but LBC callers are not as controllable and she was a little less certain in dealing with them. “Can I just interrupt you there?” she said to one, who carried on speechifying, regardless.</p> <p>It’s a far cry from Vorderman’s old Radio Wales gig, chatting comfortably in between music to guests such as Alison Hammond and Gyles Brandreth. LBC listeners are red in tooth and claw, and it takes nous, fluency and a lot of detailed political knowledge to know when to challenge and when to hold back. But this only comes with experience, and Vorderman is certainly smart, so I imagine that in three months’ time her show will be great.</p>    <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/catchup/classicfm/uk/46wcDcz/\">Stephen Mangan</a></strong>, curly-topped actor and genial <em>Celebrity</em> <em>Gogglebox</em>-er, has also been snapped up by Global, to host a Classic FM show at exactly the same time as Vorderman (Classic FM has had a revamp: Dan Walker is hosting the weekday breakfast show). Mangan’s definitely got the easier gig, chuntering mildly for a couple of minutes in between lengthy classical tracks. Easier, but more boring. I flipped between the two and spent much more time with Vorderman and the LBC shouties.</p> <p>After <em>Fixing Britain</em>, Louise Casey’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/06/fixing-britain-with-louise-casey-review-self-help-scottee-pet-classics-new-years-eve-colin-murray\">excellent recent Radio 4 series</a> on how to solve seemingly intractable political problems, the BBC World Service’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct5mbg\">The Documentary</a></strong> strand gave us a heartening show about Finland’s solution to its homelessness problem. Essentially, it decided to flip the system. Instead of making homeless people wait until they “qualified” for housing (by giving up alcohol, getting a job etc), they housed them first and sorted out their life problems later. It’s been a huge success, with 90% of those housed staying on and rebuilding their lives.</p> <p>Now some countries are trying out a similar approach – parts of Scotland, for instance – but others say that Finland is too different a society from their own for it to work. There are only 5.5 million people in Finland, and the public sector is well funded. “It’s a bit of a lack of courage,” says one Finnish expert. “You have all the pros [advantages] – what else do you actually need?” Well, quite.</p>    <p>Just time to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/12/annie-nightingale-obituary\">Annie Nightingale</a>, who died earlier this month and provided the soundtrack of my teenage Sunday nights (she was on at 7pm, straight after the Top 40). Much has been written about her being a pioneer for women on music radio, which she undoubtedly was, but she was also an exceptionally warm person in real life. You’d see her out, big hair, dark sunglasses, and she would always be fun, friendly and kind. There are many weird egos in broadcasting. Annie was never anything other than a delight.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>On a hot summer’s evening some years ago at a well-connected Parisian’s holiday home in Provence, I witnessed a French magic trick. There were a dozen of us gathered – eight of France’s intellectual elite and four thirsty Brits. The host produced a bottle of champagne and proceeded to pour out equal micro-measures into 12 coupes.</p> <p>The quartet from these islands looked on incredulously at how he achieved this extraordinary feat of rationing, promptly downed the meagre contents of our glasses the moment we were handed them, and then waited impatiently for the second bottle to be opened.</p> <p>As we eventually learned, to our great distress, there was no second bottle, yet the Parisians sipped at their champagne quite happily for what seemed an eternity, chatting and enjoying the glorious surroundings on that balmy August evening.</p> <p>I remember thinking, as I contemplated my terminally empty glass, that here was a different way of drinking, of savouring the wine, eking out pleasure with the habitual self-discipline of a squirrel hoarding nuts. And I also recall thinking that I wanted absolutely no part of it.</p> <p>But all of three weeks into my first dry January, I wonder if there isn’t something to be admired, even adopted, about Gallic restraint in matters of social drinking.</p> <p>It’s not just the well-aired health costs of consuming alcohol – said to be the fifth largest contributor to death and disease around the globe – that prompts this rotgut rethink. It’s also the crass aesthetics of excess. Chief among these are surely those fish bowl-size glasses in which you often see wine served in British pubs. They represent the very opposite of good taste, because you don’t have to be an oenophile to realise that a third of a bottle – 250ml – in your oversized glass is simply de trop.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/18/the-end-of-the-large-wine-experts-say-health-measure-would-not-harm-pubs\" title=\"\">A recent Cambridge University study</a>, conducted in a four-week trial in 21 bars and pubs, showed that by removing 250ml wine measures from the menu, it cut the total amount that people drank by 7.6%. It’s a classic piece of nudge psychology from the paternalistic school of behavioural economics and as such its findings will no doubt be ignored by the drinks industry – the people who supersized wine measures in the first place.</p> <p>After all, the more alcohol sold, the more profit. But it’s only short-term profit if the trend for pub closures continues. There were 46,800 pubs in the UK in 2020, down from 55,400 a decade earlier. Our drinking culture is changing. There has been a steady shift over the past half century from beer to wine, and from pubs to the home. Nowadaysm younger people, generation Z with its “sober curious” (interested in drinking less) or “Californian sober” (cutting out booze but micro-dosing on mushrooms or cannabis) designations, are less inclined than previous generations to drink alcohol or go to pubs.</p> <p>In terms of cancer prevention and liver preservation, it’s hard to see this rejection of booze as anything but a healthy development. But we should be wary about throwing the baby out with the beer swill.</p> <p>For there is a sound argument that says alcohol helped create civilisation. According to Edward Slingerland, a professor of philosophy, who outlined his case in his 2021 book <em><a href=\"https://www.edwardslingerland.com/drunk\" title=\"\">Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilization</a></em>, the fermentation of beer 13,000 years ago enabled us to switch off the self-interested focus of our prefrontal cortex, and in our temporarily altered state we could build trust and communal innovation. Drawing on anthropological data, Slingerland suggests that alcohol was not a byproduct of agriculture; rather, that agriculture was the result of our need to increase the production of alcohol. He also cites a study that shows the application for patents went down in the US after prohibition and only rallied with the establishment of speakeasies.</p> <p>Part of this drop in creativity he attributes to the inhibition of sobriety, but much of it to the absence of social interaction that the closure of bars caused. The problem is that nowadays people are increasingly drinking either with just one other person or alone, and they’re drinking stronger alcohol – as recently as the 1970s the ABV (alcohol by volume) of a bottle of wine was likely to be around 10%, whereas today it’s 13-14%.</p> <p>Since it was first made, alcohol consumption has been a heavily socialised ritual, not a solitary pastime. We tend to celebrate the bacchanalian booze, but these were exceptions instead of a way of life.</p> <p>To take the best of what alcohol has given us, while trying to minimise its worst side-effects, we need to create modern rituals or social rules that make sense in today’s world. One place to start may be to encourage the idea that drinking to excess – or drinking from an enormous glass – is, well, a bit uncool.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that people are increasingly drinking either with just one other person or alone, and they’re drinking stronger alcohol</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Moderation in all things – including moderation” is the old saying drunkenly attributed to everyone from the ancient Greeks to Oscar Wilde. It’s not a bad guideline by which to lead life: <em>boire avec modération</em>, with only the occasional slaking of a British kind of thirst. With that in mind, I eagerly look forward to 1 February.</p> <p>• Andrew Anthony is an Observer writer</p>",

            "body" : "<p>On a Tuesday afternoon in mid-January, a dozen older Asian couples twirled to classic Cantonese pop hits on the neon-lit dancefloor at Lai Lai Ballroom and Studio, a beloved venue in Alhambra. The studio emanated a lush serenity of retirement bliss: between songs, dancers dressed in casual sweaters and long skirts retreated to cafe tables to chat over water and hot tea.</p> <p>That the Lai Lai Ballroom remains a refuge for immigrant Asian seniors felt like a quiet miracle to some. One year ago, on 21 January 2023, a gunman opened fire at the nearby Star Ballroom and Studio, killing 11 people in the worst mass shooting in modern Los Angeles county history. All but one of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/us/monterey-park-shooting-victims-what-we-know/index.html\">the shooter’s victims</a> were in their 60s or 70s. The shooter, Huu Can Tran, went to Lai Lai next, where its third-generation co-owner Brandon Tsay tackled and disarmed him. Despite the horror, many survivors have resumed dancing, both as a way to heal and an expression of defiance.</p> <p>After he survived the shooting at Star Ballroom, Lloyd Gock, 67, didn’t wait long before returning to Lai Lai. Five years earlier, he had fallen into a severe depression as business suffered at his clothing company, Montana Jeans. One night, his friend took him swing dancing, where he felt such an extraordinary sense of relief that he kept going back week after week. He lost 30lbs, which helped keep his diabetes under control. To this day, he said dancing is the only thing that keeps him sane. “My deep depression never came back because I kept dancing,” he said. “If I were to stop because of this one idiot, who knows where I would be?”</p>      <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I were to stop because of this one idiot, who knows where I would be?</p> <footer> <cite>Lloyd Gock</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ballroom dancing has long been part of the Asian immigrant community in Los Angeles. Europeans and Americans brought ballroom dancing to Asia starting in the 1920s through colonialism and militarism, said Yutian Wong, a professor of dance studies at San Francisco State University. In the 1980s and 1990s, the phenomenon began to take off in the US among ageing, college-educated Chinese and Taiwanese immigrants, as well as south-east Asian refugees, who were looking for spaces to socialize. “Ballroom dancing has always had this aspiration element to it,” she said. “There’s a sheen of respectability and a class element to it.”</p> <p>For Valentino Alvero, a Filipino immigrant who was killed during the shooting, dancing was a way to connect with the homeland he left behind, said Alvero’s daughter Kristenne Reidy. The revival of swing dancing in 1990s Philippines and the rise of the disco band VST &amp; Company reached Filipino immigrants in the US. Reidy said her parents caught the fever and enrolled in a class, where they fell in love with swing, foxtrot and cha cha. “Something about dancing that appealed to Dad was that you really forgot about all the troubles and negative encounters you had throughout the day,” she said.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Brandon Tsay at Lai Lai Ballroom in Alhambra, California on 13 January 2024.</p></li> </ul>      <p>Lai Lai and Star were “two sides of the same coin”, said Tsay, who became a national hero for his actions. The studios served roughly the same clientele, but where the latter has closed for good, the former has become an anchor for those hoping to find joy and hope after tragedy.</p> <p>Paul Cao, a decade-long customer at Lai Lai and Star Ballroom, said the shooting had no impact on his desire to dance because his passion for the activity outweighed his fear. But he said some of his friends and fellow dancers took several months off. A few still haven’t returned to the ballroom.</p> <p>Cao and his wife, Millie, were the subjects of the 2019 Oscar-nominated short documentary Walk Run Cha Cha, which followed their love story from Vietnam to Lai Lai Ballroom. “It’s a big struggle for me to learn anything because my memory is not good anymore,” he said. “Dancing takes me back to the old days when I was in high school, to the joy of still being able to teach your body new things.”</p>      <p>For some former patrons at Star, though, the terror that the shooting caused was difficult to overcome. Yalin Faulk, who was the part-time assistant and bookkeeper at the venue, said she’s stopped ballroom dancing altogether after the shooting. For more than a decade, she’d spent the entirety of her Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons working and socializing with friends at Star. Faulk, 63, said she now spends that time alone at home, dancing only once a week on Saturday at a private studio. “It’s been very lonely and sad,” she said.</p> <p>Last Saturday, to commemorate the shooting victims and share mental health resources, Tsay organized a community dance at Lai Lai, which his grandparents opened more than three decades ago. More than 100 people showed up, far exceeding his expectations. Separately, Tsay has also started an organization, the Brandon Tsay Hero fund, to raise awareness about mental health among seniors.</p>    <p>The first months after the shooting, Tsay said, had felt like “a nail in the coffin”. During the month-long closure that followed, his family thought about selling the business, worried that the shooting would compound the losses they incurred during the pandemic. But Tsay said they realized Lai Lai played such a vital role in shaping the livelihood of the hundreds of seniors who file through its doors every week. Before reopening, Tsay said he spent roughly $30,000 hiring guards and installing security upgrades, including new lights and cameras, so that patrons can feel safe to return. “I want them to be able to enjoy their golden years of retirement,” he said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Twenty-first century cookbooks are dangerously seductive, their gorgeous, pouting covers and soothingly whispered reassurances inducing an instantaneous culinary swoon. This book, you think, is about to change my life. But alas, only rarely is this so. Confession time (no shame in this column). Last year, I kissed more than a few new cookbooks, each one more devastatingly handsome than the last – and yet only in one case did a serious relationship bloom.</p> <p>And so it was that I decided to begin January with an old and rather less glamorous lover in my arms in the form of Jane Grigson’s <em>English Food</em>, a book that will be 50 years old this year. My copy of this classic is rather plain looking – a few tiny woodcuts are all it offers in the way of illustration – and its author’s tone, though not unkindly, is of course sometimes rather stern (NB I mean this in a strictly non-kinky way). But to wrestle with it, whether in the kitchen or in the boudoir, is nevertheless a fully satisfying experience. This is a book so good, even when it’s at its most old-fashioned, it still seems modish: exciting, even, if you’re in the right mood.</p> <p>I’ve often wondered why Grigson, who was the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/15/jane-grigson-her-life-and-legacy\" title=\"\">Observer’s </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/15/jane-grigson-her-life-and-legacy\" title=\"\">cookery writer from 1968 until 1990</a>, is still much less well known than her friend and supporter, Elizabeth David. But never more so than right now. While her influence is, to take just one example, all over Jeremy Lee’s award-winning keeper of a book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/21/sardines-toast-pork-chop-apple-tarts-recipes-jeremy-lee-quo-vadis\" title=\"\">Cooking: Simply and Well, for One or Many</a></em> – among other dishes, they both love the layered flavours of a salmagundi – her own writing somehow remains the province only of middle-aged, slightly nerdy types like me, who favour a little learning with their recipe for potted shrimps (according to Grigson, potted shrimps only became popular outside Lancashire in the 1930s, when a shop called Young’s in Beauchamp Place in Kensington began selling them).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Reading her, you come to feel that the best English food combines the high and the low</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What I would say to those who are chary of her – or who don’t (shock, horror) know her books at all – is that not only do Grigson’s recipes work; she’s also, at this point, the perfect antidote to a certain kind of jadedness. Charred hispi cabbage be damned! <em>English Food</em> is bulging with things that, now half or even entirely forgotten, suddenly seem wonderfully new without being at all faddish or insubstantial. If, say, I was running the kind of good but rather safe gastropub where the only sweet thing on offer is inevitably an almond tart, I would flip through it immediately in search of ideas. For instance: Isle of Wight pudding. Ever since I read the recipe in bed the other night, I’ve been vaguely preoccupied with this fat but inexpensive sausage of loveliness, a dough of flour and butter (or lard) spread with blackberries and honey that is rolled like a roly-poly, covered with single cream, and baked in the oven. “The most delicious juice emerges,” writes Grigson, succinctly. It sounds perfect: a rescue mission par excellence for the sad punnet of blackberries we all have lurking somewhere in the freezer at this time of year.</p> <p>There is luxury in <em>English Food</em>: an immaculate crab tart; little pots of chocolate flavoured lightly with rosemary. But there’s a plainness in it, too – one that feels just right for now, when things are so hard for so many. It isn’t only that Grigson, who grew up in Sunderland, is necessarily attentive to foods that are filling, tight budgets and leftovers. Her writing reminds us that cooks have always had to make do; that toad in the hole was originally made, not with sausages, but with the remains of the joint.</p> <p>Reading her, you come to feel, perhaps reassuringly, that the best English food combines the high and the low, in all sorts of different ways. Those who hanker, as I will until the end of my days, for the great Rowley Leigh’s parmesan custards – the London pop-up in which he briefly revived this most famous of his dishes is now sadly closed – might like to try Lady Shaftesbury’s toasted cheese, a bubbling combination of butter, grated cheddar, cream and egg yolk, named for the wife of a Victorian earl who was perennially broke. Serve in small ramekins with toast soldiers, and eat with gratitude – to Jane and to all who still sail in her. </p> <p><em>@MsRachelCooke</em></p>",

Every corporation worldwide would be turned into a giant unpaid tax policeman. It had the potential to radically reduce the scope for bad actors to exploit legitimate businesses. A compelling answer to the accusation that the City of London was the “dirty money capital of the world”.</p> <p>The CFA followed the successful model of the Bribery Act. That also created an automatic criminal offence for corporations, with one single defence that incentivised them to get their house in order. And people take the Bribery Act very seriously indeed – all the more so after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/airbus-to-pay-record-3bn-in-fines-for-endemic-corruption\" title=\"\">Airbus had to pay £830m</a> in the UK to settle a bribery prosecution in 2020, and Entain had to pay a £615m penalty last year.</p> <p>People took the CFA equally seriously at first. We all awaited the first prosecutions: in 2019 HMRC announced it had nine live investigations, then 13 in 2020. But nothing happened. Each year, more investigations were announced; each year, no prosecutions.</p> <p>And so, bit by bit, the CFA has ceased to become scary. It is now 2024 and there have still been no prosecutions. Those clients who paid for exhaustive work across their global business probably feel like chumps. Some of their rivals, who winged it, probably feel vindicated. Even the best anti-tax evasion processes need regular updating – but who’s going to spend serious money updating their 2017 work now?</p> <p>So that valuable protection against tax evasion is, year by year, becoming less valuable. Certainly all that talk about other countries following the UK’s lead has melted away.</p> <p>It’s possible that the reason no company has been prosecuted under the CFA is that not a single UK company has facilitated tax evasion since 2017. That, however, doesn’t feel terribly likely. The more plausible reason is that when evidence has come to light of tax evasion being facilitated, HMRC has quietly assessed penalties behind the scenes, and the matter has been resolved quietly.</p> <p>This likely makes sense from a raw economic perspective. HMRC gets to collect tax without the time, expense and risk of a prosecution. But in the long term it’s a serious mistake. It neuters what was once a powerful tool.</p> <p>A law that’s not publicly enforced may as well not exist. Only saints will comply with it. The rest – the people we really want to comply with it – won’t bother.</p> <p>If we want to drive tax evasion out of the corporate world, we don’t need new rules – we just need to enforce the ones we have.</p> <p><em>Dan Neidle is a former head of tax at Clifford Chance and founder of Tax Policy Associates.</em></p>",

It introduced “strict liability”, meaning that a company cannot plead ignorance of the wrongdoing to evade a criminal charge, and prosecutors do not have to prove intent in order to secure a conviction.</p> <p>It also threatened unlimited fines in the case of established wrongdoing. Companies can avoid punishment if they have reasonable procedures in place to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion.</p> <p>The law both made criminal prosecutions easier to pursue and strengthened the penalties. In April 2016, in response to the leak of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\" title=\"\">the Panama Papers</a> which revealed how companies and the rich exploited tax havens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/david-cameron-corporate-money-laundering-offence-anti-corruption-summit\" title=\"\">David Cameron, then prime minister</a>, said: “Under current legislation it is difficult to prosecute a company that assists with tax evasion. But we are going to change that.”</p> <p>But critics say the refusal to charge a single company has cast serious doubts on the landmark legislation.</p> <p>“The lack of any Corporate Criminal Offence prosecutions is quite serious,” said Dan Neidle, founder of Tax Policy Associates and formerly head of tax at Clifford Chance. “A deterrent that you never use is no deterrent.”</p> <p>Criminal penalties were the only reliable way to change behaviour, while the over-reliance on civil penalties and fines often failed to curb serious wrongdoing, Neidle said. “If you disarm yourself and don’t use the criminal tools that you have available, then you are missing the trick.”</p>    <p>A spokesperson for HMRC said: “Corporate criminal offences were introduced to encourage organisations to put preventative measures in place to stop tax evasion. Our efforts have helped drive a corporate culture shift towards anti-tax evasion awareness, which has led to new procedures across business sectors.”</p> <p>HMRC said it has 11 live investigations and is looking into a further 24 possible cases. It has also reviewed and rejected an additional 94.</p> <p>Hodge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax, said: “We are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, and tax evasion is costing our economy billions each year. So it is appalling that HMRC has failed to prosecute a single enabler of tax evasion.</p> <p>“We know that there continues to be a whole industry that supports those who don’t want to pay their fair share of tax. We cannot drive cultural change in that industry if its members are under the impression that this offence is just a paper tiger.”</p> <p>HMRC prioritises the recouping of money lost to tax avoidance and evasion through civil settlements, rather than prosecutions, according to Robert Palmer, the director of Tax Justice UK. He cited the risk and cost of prosecuting powerful opponents with deep pockets.</p> <p>“HMRC is routinely outgunned by the private sector,” he said. “It’s a real problem, because the minute you go against someone who’s rich, they can lawyer up and drag things out. HMRC are outmatched … particularly when it comes to the professional enablers and facilitators.”</p> <p>Other legislation with similar “failure to prevent” clauses has resulted in charges and convictions. The UK Bribery Act 2010 made it a crime to fail to prevent bribery and has led to high-profile prosecutions, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/04/petrofac-fined-bribes-to-secure-middle-east-contracts\" title=\"\">the oil and gas company Petrofac in 2021</a>.</p> <p>The realistic threat of criminal prosecutions means “the Bribery Act continues to be taken very, very seriously,” said Neidle, “whereas<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/06/crackdowns-finance-government-laws-regulation-pandora-papers\" title=\"\"> the Criminal Finances Act</a> is dropping off the radar.”</p> <p>Susan Hawley, director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “Legislation only has a deterrent effect for so long without any meaningful enforcement.</p> <p>“The government urgently needs to get to the bottom of whether this lack of prosecutions is related to failures of political will or resourcing issues at HMRC, or deeper problems with the wording of the offence.”</p> <p><em>Edward Siddons is a reporter at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>Christian Dior would have loved the fashion dominating this award season’s red carpets. The designer’s much-quoted remark – “After women, flowers are the most divine creations” – must have been pinned to the mood boards of the stylists and designers of many of the outfits seen this month at the Golden Globes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2024/jan/16/emmys-2024-red-carpet-arrivals-fashion-style-looks-succession-white-lotus\" title=\"\">Emmys</a> and Critics Choice Awards, where florals were the main look.</p> <p>Last week alone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss\" title=\"\">Kate Moss</a> celebrated her 50th birthday in a vintage black floral lace dress; at the Emmys, actor Ali Wong wore a Louis Vuitton look with beaded flowers; and <em>Saltburn</em> actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/16/ive-always-felt-like-an-outsider-rosamund-pike-on-class-shame-and-her-blistering-turn-in-saltburn\" title=\"\">Rosamund Pike</a> chose a Simone Rocha dress with long-stemmed roses sewn into its pockets for the Bafta tea party.</p> <p>They are the latest stars to step out in flowers as the awards season – which culminates with the Oscars on 10 March – kicked off. </p> <p>While flowers are a perennial favourite for fashion designers, this crop of red-carpet creations is unusually diverse. Some are ultra-feminine, made of tulle and sequins, while others are stylised. <em>White Lotus</em> actor Simona Tabasco wore a Marni dress at the Emmys with flowers collaged like a primary school art project. Representing for trouser suits, <em>The Last of Us</em> actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/oct/13/being-in-my-20s-feels-disgusting-bella-ramsey-on-fame-fear-and-daddy-pedro-pascal\" title=\"\">Bella Ramsey </a>wore a toile patterned Thom Browne suit to the Critics Choice Awards, and musician and actor Donald Glover accessorised his Emmys embroidered Bode suit with a pair of opera slippers. The sling that actor Pedro Pascal wore for his broken shoulder featured a black corsage.</p>    <p>Amy De La Haye, professor at the London College of Fashion, and author of <em>Ravishing: the Rose in Fashion</em>, says that, historically, the cultural connotations of flowers varied widely. “In Ancient Rome, it was men who wore flower-scented perfumes; women preferred stronger scents. It was not until the 19th century that flowers became gendered feminine. This coincided with the evolution of haute couture and mass-production fashion industries.”</p> <p>Dresses have been spectacular this award season. Cailee Spaeny, star of Sofia Coppola’s film <em>Priscilla</em>, showed that wallpaper-esque ditsy florals – courtesy of Miu Miu – look good on the red carpet. The Dior outfit worn by <em>Wednesday</em> actor Jenna Ortega to the Emmys was embroidered with a silver trellis and wisteria, roses and clematis made of silk and sequins.</p> <p>Emily Blunt also wore a dress inspired by flowers climbing a trellis last week – but hers was in leather, by Oscar de la Renta.</p> <p>Audrey Taillée, editor in chief of lifestyle magazine <em>Lula</em>, says: “Floral can be a risky choice for print on the red carpet, but as embroidery or lace it gives a very delicate silhouette – such as Emma Stone’s sequinned Louis Vuitton dress or Riley Keough’s Chanel at the Golden Globes.”</p>    <p>Beyond the celebrity world, flowers are on trend for this year’s spring fashion. Roses appeared in many 2024 fashion week shows. Unusually, the long-stemmed rose, thorns and all, cropped up in many collections, twisted into handbags, earrings and decorative motifs.</p> <p>Human affiliation with nature is often referenced as a creative influence – it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/jan/14/prada-milan-fashion-week-autumn-winter-menswear-collection\" title=\"\">cited by fashion designer Miuccia Prada</a> at her latest menswear show – but the fascination with plants is as old as time. “Humans have always worn natural flowers,” says De La Hay. “They have ornamented the body with flower artefacts since at least Ancient Egyptian times, when rose petals were charred to darken brows and the first artificial flowers – known as permanent botanicals – were crafted.”</p> <p>Or, as Miranda Priestly, <em>Vogue</em> editor in <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>, says in a line quoted as often as Dior’s: “Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.”</p>",

Below is a summary of the latest developments to get you up to speed.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Russia has accused Ukraine of being behind a drone strike that sparked a huge inferno at an oil depot in western Russia on Friday, the latest in a series of escalating cross-border attacks. </strong>Russian officials and news reports said four oil reservoirs with a total capacity of 6,000 cubic metres (1.6m gallons) were set on fire at the oil refinery after the drone reached Klintsy, a city of 70,000 people located about 60km (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Air defences electronically jammed the drone but it dropped its explosive payload on the facility, the Bryansk regional governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said. There were no casualties, he added. The strike is the second on a Russian oil depot in as many days, part of what Kyiv has called “fair” retaliation for Moscow’s strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Separately, a fire tore through the Ryazan oil refinery, Russia’s third largest, on Friday, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said, quoting emergency services. The fire at the oil refinery, south-east of Moscow and is controlled by Rosneft, has been put out and there were no injuries, RIA news agency reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US aid to Ukraine remains deadlocked in Congress</strong> despite Joe Biden signing on Friday a measure to keep the US government funded. Hard-right House Republicans, led by the speaker, Mike Johnson, are ensuring that the chances of more money and weapons for Kyiv in its fight with Moscow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/19/biden-signs-government-funding-ukraine-aid-frozen\">hinge on negotiations for US immigration changes</a>. After a Wednesday White House meeting, Johnson told reporters: “We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine. But the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security.” Many observers suggest Republicans do not want a deal, instead using the issue, and the concept of more aid for Ukraine, as clubs with which to attack Biden in an election year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Russian court in Siberia on Friday sentenced a man to 19 years in prison for shooting a military enlistment officer</strong>, while prosecutors in St Petersburg asked for a 28-year sentence for Darya Trepova, a woman charged in the bombing of a cafe last April that killed a prominent military blogger, reports said. The developments underscore the authorities’ determination to harshly punish anyone who acts against President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, especially those committing acts of violence, in the run-up to the presidential election in March that the incumbent is all but certain to win.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The European Union said on Friday it would drastically increase ammunition production this year</strong> in response to Ukraine’s growing pleas for support in its war against Russia, which prompted the French ambassador to protest against the country’s “growing involvement” in the conflict. The EU will be able to produce at least 1.3m rounds of ammunition by the end of this year, the EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said on a visit to Estonia. “We are at a crucial moment for our collective security in Europe, and in the war of aggression run by Russia in Ukraine, Europe must and will continue to support Ukraine with all its means,” he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Landmines once again surround the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine,</strong> which is in Russian hands, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. Europe’s largest nuclear facility fell to Russian forces shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of planning an incident at the site. “Mines along the perimeter of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) ... are now back in place,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nato will launch its biggest military exercises in decades next week, with about 90,000 personnel set to take part in months of drills </strong>aimed at showing the alliance can defend all of its territory up to its border with Russia, top officers said on Thursday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Finland does not see any immediate military threat from Russia, the country’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said</strong> on Friday at a press conference with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Britain brushed off a Russian plan to ban UK ships from fishing in Moscow’s waters on Friday as an example of Russia’s “self-imposed isolation”</strong>, while an industry body said it would have no impact because Britain’s fleet doesn’t fish there anyway.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU has started discussions on a new sanctions package for Russia</strong> that it aims to approve by 24 February, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>About 160 people who applied for asylum at Finland’s eastern border last year have since disappeared</strong>, amid a sudden surge of asylum seekers arriving via Russia, Finland’s immigration authority said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin said on Friday there was no prospect of reviving the Black Sea grain</strong> <strong>deal</strong> and that alternative routes for shipping Ukrainian grain carried huge risks, Reuters reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Police in the central Russian republic of Bashkortostan on Friday arrested more protesters incensed over the jailing of local activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/17/hundreds-of-protesters-clash-with-police-in-russian-republic-of-bashkortostan\">Fail Alsynov</a>,</strong> who campaigns for the protection of the Bashkir language, as a court sentenced nine demonstrators to short jail terms, reports AFP.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-20T10:37:36.471Z\">at 10.37am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

            "body" : "<p>It was plain long before the 7 October attacks that Israel badly needed a change of leadership. That need is now urgent. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/15/netanyahu-israel-western-allies-religious-coalition\" title=\"\">should have resigned</a> over the security failures surrounding the Hamas massacre, when about 1,200 Israelis were murdered. Instead, he has blamed others. Netanyahu argued the crisis required him to stay and lead a war to destroy the terrorists. He has repeatedly promised “total victory” and the freeing of Israeli hostages. But he has repeatedly failed to deliver.</p> <p>The ongoing violence is unprecedented, Hamas is undefeated, many innocents remain in captivity, and government and country are split over tactics and a long-term settlement. Netanyahu must go.</p> <p>The invasion and occupation of Gaza, launched in late October, is turning into a disaster for Israel. It already is a disaster for Palestinians, nearly 25,000 of whom have been killed, according to local health ministry figures. The UN warned last week that 2.2 million people face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/us-food-medicine-aid-gaza-un-famine-warnings-israel\" title=\"\">famine conditions</a>, exacerbated by Israel’s unceasing attacks and obstruction of humanitarian aid. Most homes in the north are uninhabitable. Gaza is now termed the most dangerous place on Earth for children. Such misery is indescribable and a reproach to all.</p> <p>The disaster engulfing Israel has unfolded more slowly following the immediate shock of 7 October – but, in many ways, is no less existential. The public no longer feels safe, President Isaac Herzog admits. Confidence in the country’s political leadership, already low, and its security forces and intelligence agencies has been <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-19/ty-article/.premium/netanyahus-government-gets-more-delusional-as-israels-campaign-in-gaza-grinds-on/0000018d-1e3d-dd75-addd-fefd93760000\" title=\"\">severely shaken</a>. Netanyahu’s “total war” in Gaza has stoked conflict in the occupied West Bank, with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israel now faces a multi-arena struggle that may last for months and result in many more deaths.</p> <p>Netanyahu’s war has set back the Abraham accords normalisation process between Israel and Gulf Arab states. It has isolated the country internationally to an extraordinary degree, judging by recent votes at the UN general assembly. Israel stands accused in the Hague of committing acts of genocide, which it denies. Relations with friendly European countries, whose impassioned calls for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza it rejects, are badly strained. Significantly, Netanyahu is now in open <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-and-netanyahu-have-finally-talked-but-their-visions-still-clash-for-ending-israel-hamas-war\" title=\"\">dispute with the US</a>, Israel’s most important ally, aid provider and arms supplier.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is plain to almost everyone that his reliance on far right extremist ministers is distorting sensible decision-making</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many Israelis are appalled by Netanyahu’s selfish, destructive behaviour. Internal pressure for a change of prime minister and a change in Israel’s war and post-war strategies is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/14/shin-bet-ami-ayalon-calls-on-israel-release-intifada-leader-marwan-barghouti\" title=\"\">building rapidly</a>. Opinion polls suggest the public no longer trusts Netanyahu and wants him gone. The standing of his Likud party has plunged, too. It is plain to almost everyone that the prime minister’s reliance on far right extremist ministers to hold his coalition together is distorting sensible decision-making. Opposition parties are clamouring for early elections.</p> <p>This necessary and overdue domestic debate reached a new level of intensity last week following a dramatic intervention by Gadi Eisenkot, an observer member of the war cabinet and former army chief of staff. Eisenkot said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/israeli-minister-says-only-ceasefire-can-free-hostages-as-cabinet-rift-deepens\" title=\"\">release of the remaining hostages</a> must be the immediate priority, and for this to happen a ceasefire was required. He accused Netanyahu of misleading Israelis by claiming Hamas could be eliminated. Urgent attention should be paid to the shape of a post-war political settlement, he said.</p> <p>Ehud Barak, a former Labour prime minister, noted the US had presented Netanyahu with a post-war plan but had hit a brick wall. Under the proposal, an “inter-Arab force” would oversee security in Gaza under the auspices of a “revitalised” Palestinian Authority, whose right to govern would be recognised internationally. Rebuilding would be underwritten by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. “The American proposal is the only practical blueprint; in exchange, Israel will have to take part in future talks toward a two-state solution,” <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2024-01-18/ty-article-opinion/.premium/israel-needs-an-early-election-before-its-too-late/0000018d-1e42-db77-ad9f-df72b59c0000\" title=\"\">Barak wrote</a>.</p> <p>Without such a solution – meaning establishment of a sovereign, independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel – there would be no long-term peace and security, Barak said. “In the absence of a realistic goal, we will end up mired in the Gaza quagmire, fighting simultaneously in Lebanon and in the West Bank, eroding the American backing and endangering the Abraham accords and the peace agreements with Egypt and with Jordan... One can argue the US proposal is bad; one cannot keep it from being discussed.”</p> <p>This is the nub of the matter. The US supports a two-state solution in principle. Its final shape remains up for discussion. So, too, do the Palestinians and most other countries. It is, by general agreement, the best available route forward. Yet, at this critical moment, what did Netanyahu do? Deliberately, and with a large dose of self-interested political calculation, he chose last week to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/world/middleeast/netanyahu-palestinian-state-israel-gaza-war.html\" title=\"\">explicitly restate his unyielding opposition</a>. “In any arrangement in the foreseeable future... Israel must have security control over all the territory west of the Jordan,” he said. A sovereign Palestine was not an option. It would never happen.</p> <p>Perhaps Netanyahu genuinely believes a two-state solution could not work. Perhaps he hopes, by adopting a hardline stance, he can persuade Israelis that he, despite leading them into disaster, is still their best hope of future security. Perhaps he thinks this will save his job until a second Trump presidency comes to his rescue. He’s wrong on all counts. Netanyahu is no partner for peace. He is its enemy. Now is the moment for the Biden administration, Britain and all of Israel’s friends to tell him to get out of the way. Now is the moment for Israelis to throw him out.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Power, the documentarian Yance Ford’s clinical inquiry into US policing, isn’t trafficking in new information. The 86-minute project billed as an “essay-film”, which premiered at Sundance and will stream on Netflix later this year, has clear eyes on the past, synthesizing the work of several academics with a robust archival record to examine the origins, structure and impact of police power in the United States.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/18/girls-state-mock-government-documentary-review\">Girls State review – compelling follow-up to hit documentary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That doesn’t mean it’s unnecessary; the film makes cogent, sweeping sense of the record for perhaps the most illuminative, swift and damning case against the institution of policing – the real fourth estate, as one subject puts it – of the many investigations conducted in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. But there’s a dryness to its procedure. Though more visually elegant and poetic (almost to a fault, owing to Ford’s at times ponderous narration) than a Netflix Explained entry, Power basically has the same function as a nonfiction explainer. Perhaps owing to its ample use of academics to supply the exclamation points and through-lines to a truly remarkable collage of archival footage, the film has the feel of a very deluxe college lecture. (A visual metaphor linking policing power to an atomic bomb, while mesmerizing to look at, never fully lands.)</p> <p>Ford, who previously directed Sundance breakout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/26/strong-island-review-yance-ford-documentary-murder-brother\">Strong Island</a> about the murder of his brother, smartly structures Power not by chronology but theme. Among them, social control, status quo and global uprising, starting with the three primary origins of policing in the US: the expansion into the frontier, which forced the removal of Indigenous people; the evolution of slave patrols in the south, which monitored the movement of Black bodies; and the municipal policing of workers across the country, which disrupted organized labor. All three, as numerous academics point out, hinged on the control of perceived threats to the social hierarchy and order through the harassment of an other.</p> <p>Power moves seamlessly through the past and present, connecting the formation of corrupt police departments and the colonialist origins of paramilitary tactics to the crackdowns, persecution and abject violence perpetrated by modern US police officers, often caught on cellphone or body cameras and blasted across media. Numerous subjects – among them the journalist Wesley Lowery, who has extensively covered the state of US policing amid the Black Lives Matter movement, and Redditt Hudson, a Black former police officer turned police reform activist – make the point that police are imbued with unchecked power. That they wield the power to end lives without accountability. That most of the harm caused by policing in the US is perfectly legal. That policing has always been more about maintaining social hierarchies than actual safety.</p> <p>All of which is known, if you’ve been paying attention. That many Americans still don’t alone justifies the Netflix distribution. But room remains for Power to delve beyond unassailable structural arguments into individual complications – the type of experiences that lead people to continue supporting police as is, or what makes federal funding for law enforcement a promise politically impossible to break. The film’s one on-the-ground source is Charlie Adams, a Black longtime police officer in Minneapolis; his precinct is six miles from the one where George Floyd was murdered in 2020.</p> <p>In the film’s standout scene, Adams meets with Black community advocates to discuss better policing. Adams, who has first-hand experience with police racism and has advocated for more Black officers, notes a streak of routine carjackings by Black youth in the precinct, an issue he attributes to a revolving door of arrests. The advocates note no one is seeking a rehabilitation plan or second chances; Black youths are deemed disposable in the eyes of the justice system – they’re “setting all of us up to fail, and this shit doesn’t happen in Edina”, one says, referring to a predominantly white, wealthy suburb nearby.</p> <p>It’s a tricky, specific conversation, one I wish the film included more of, and of the kind Lowery and others call for when discussing real reform of a system that evidently harms so many. Power easily makes the case that that system was corrupt all along, from 18th-century slave patrols to 19th-century strikebreakers, 20th-century Jim Crow to 21st-century police shootings. The film ends with a quote by Frederick Douglass: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.” Power gives deep contextual grounding to a demand for change. How to make it is a question for another time.</p> <ul> <li><p>Power is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released on Netflix later this year</p></li> </ul>",

As governor of South Carolina, she appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012. “We need a president who understands that the American people are sick and tired about being sick and tired,” Scott told a Trump rally in the state on Friday. “We need a president our foreign adversaries are afraid of and our allies respect.”</p> <p>The broad backing of Trump at such an early stage of the nomination process is uncharacteristic of presidential election campaigns, when battles for the placement can often drag out into the summer. But Trump’s crushing victory in Iowa on Monday night has accelerated the race.</p> <p>“It’s time for us to unite our party so that we make sure that the only target we’re talking about is firing Joe Biden,” Scott <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6345214995112\">told Fox News </a>after formally backing the frontrunner.</p> <p>But that unity has not been on display in recent days as Haley, who is running about 20 point points behind Trump among Republican primary voters in the state, according to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/19/trump-new-hampshire-primary-poll-00136565\">polls released this week</a>, is hoping independent voters will lift her primary challenge in the vital state.</p> <p>Trump laid into the former South Carolina governor at rally in her home state, saying he is “probably” not choosing Haley as his running mate. “She is not presidential timber,” Trump said.</p> <p>“I know her very well. She’s not tough enough. She’s not smart enough. And she wasn’t respected enough. She cannot do this job. She’s not going to be able to deal with President Xi. She’s not going to be able to deal with Putin.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Haley struck back. “Americans aren’t stupid to just believe what he says,” <a href=\"https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2024/01/18/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-donald-trump-primary\">Haley told reporters at an event in the state this week.</a> “The reality is: who lost the House for us? Who lost the Senate? Who lost the White House? Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Nikki Haley will win every single one of those back.”</p> <p>Haley’s TV ads in the state have also attempted to mine deep voter dissatisfaction with the likely candidates in November’s election. “The two most disliked politicians in America? Trump and Biden. Both are consumed by chaos, negativity and grievances of the past,” a voiceover says in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eLzZ4Zy1F0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">an advertising spot</a>. “The better choice for a better America? Nikki Haley.”</p> <p>Haley spent Friday campaigning with New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu. At a campaign event she accused Trump of “telling a whole lot of lies”.</p> <p>“If he’s gonna lie about me, I’m gonna tell the truth about him,” she added.</p> <p>Their political slug match has intensified as Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, humbled in Iowa, mired in the single-digits in New Hampshire and trailing badly in South Carolina, the next state to hold a primary contest, signaled that he is washing his hands of the 2024 election and focusing on 2028.</p> <p>Meanwhile, with both Trump and Biden seemingly in position for a November rematch, Democrats appear ready to adapt their messaging from Trump’s threat-to-democracy approach to combine it with the issue of reproductive rights.</p> <p>Abortion politics and opposition to the overturning of federal abortion rights proved a winner for the party in 2022’s midterm elections.</p> <p>“Democrats will keep it as a core part of their messaging heading into the fall because it’s such a clear contrast to the Republican position, which is out of step with where the American people are on this issue,” <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4418310-democrats-abortion-politics-2024/\">Democratic communications strategist Katie Grant Drew told the Hill.</a></p> <p>The Biden campaign is also homing in on abortion with campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez circulating a memo on Friday saying that when Americans go to the polls, “they will go knowing that the fate of every American woman’s freedom to make her own health care decisions is on the line”.</p>",

The ball had bobbled into touch in Quins territory. André Esterhuizen retrieved it, looked up and saw Nick David gesticulating. He simply lobbed him the ball, and the Quins wing ran it home while Ulster scratched their heads.</p> \n<p>David was sent to the sin bin a couple of minutes later for a deliberate knock-on. This was Ulster’s period of greatest pressure, Nick Timoney tearing into the home defence time and again. The visitors levelled the score when Robert Baloucoune picked a superb line to combine with John Cooney and Mike Lowry, who sent David McCann over out wide.</p> \n<p>At that point, the smart money might have been on the bristling Irishmen but Lynagh changed all that. Marcus Smith called a mark and Lynagh shouted in his ear. Smith fed him and Lynagh was off from his 22. He ran clean through Billy Burns, then chipped into Ulster’s 22. A wicked bounce denied the covering Jacob Stockdale and sat up sweetly into Lynagh’s arms for a fabulous solo score. He was at it again a few minutes later. Not quite so spectacular perhaps, but the determination of his chase, after Esterhuizen’s hacking-on of a loose ball, was rewarded when Baloucoune misread the bobbling ball. The Ulster wing tried to fall on it, but missed, and Lynagh was able to scoop up for his second.</p> \n<p>That helped Quins to a 21-7 lead at the break. Danny Care jinked and jived his inimitable way over for the fourth, early in the second half, which earned the bonus point that put Quins into second place. By now, Quins’ scrum was waxing too, and Ulster were up against it. Esterhuizen crashed over on the hour, after Care tapped a penalty, and then came a length-of-the-field counter in classical Quins tradition. Tyrone Green fielded a clearance and fed Smith, who broke. Green took the return pass much further upfield, and David appeared on his shoulder to run it home.</p> \n<p>Will Evans scooped up another loose ball for Quins’ seventh in the 73rd minute, but tries in the last 10 minutes by Stuart McCloskey and Stockdale gave the visitors fleeting hope of a bonus point at least.</p> \n<p>It was not to be for them, but Quins’ hope lives on.</p>",

And that was the end of that: never touched alcohol again.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I showed my husband West Indian and Jamaican dishes, and now he smashes them better than me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Tea is my drink. </strong>Black tea in the morning, and then as the day goes on it’s the green teas, it’s the mints or chamomile or ginger or whatever.

Now people just find it fun and quirky and, yeah, definitely Bev.</p> <p><strong>I moved to London in 1995</strong> and<strong> </strong>experienced food and a level of cuisine I’d never had before.

But a whole world opened up to me and I loved it.</p> <p><strong>My husband is an ex-chef, </strong>so he tends to take over the kitchen – lucky me! I showed him West Indian and specifically Jamaican dishes, and now he smashes them better than me, which really annoys me. But he’ll tell you himself, he is a bit of a nightmare in the kitchen. Because he’ll stand there and watch you: “Oh, I wouldn’t have done it like that …” He’ll tell my mum! My mum, who’s 75 and has been cooking since she was six. She’ll be like, “Get out of my kitchen!” in the best and most bantery way.</p> <p><strong>Prince was a brilliant host, brilliant.</strong> He invited me to Los Angeles in 2008 to perform at his Oscars party and I remember vividly walking into his house and him saying: “Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat?” I knew Prince didn’t eat meat, but he had a chef in and I got salmon and salads. And it was … it was a spread. I don’t know why I remember that salmon so much, but it was gorgeous. </p> <h2>My favourite things</h2> <p><strong>Food<br></strong>Ackee and saltfish, all day long.

On <em>Hirondelle</em> they ally their acoustic folk with two other traditions: that of Provençal, represented by Tant Que Li Siam, a trio who champion the polyphony of the Occitan dialect, and Trio Mythos, a classical three-piece led by Scottish viola player and composer Sophie Renshaw, founded to explore the connections between baroque and folk.</p> <p>Its title is French for swallow (as in the bird), and the album was cut in a week in an East Lothian cottage. The strings of Trio Mythos add piquancy to the two folk outfits; they are mournful on the Gillespies’ Golden One, a Wordsworthian memoir of freedom found in nature, and more jaunty on the Provençal group’s tales of old Aragon and the might of Mont Ventoux. Their own piece, Carolan’s Cup, is sweet and elegiac. The Gillespies get the lion’s share; Tina’s Song is an elegant protest against fracking (“to crack the earth’s bones to make dollars and pounds”<em>),</em> and two odes to Northumberland are yearning and poetic.

            "body" : "<p>Welcome or not, a breaking wave of screen sex is upon us. Television dramas are chock-full of intimate encounters and now cinemagoers have been warned to fasten their seatbelts, since many of the new films up for prizes in the next couple of months feature unusually graphic moments.</p> <p>In fact, this could well be “the sexiest awards season in years”, or at least the one with the most sex scenes in it. So says the producer and film expert <a href=\"http://www.jasonsolomons.com/\" title=\"\">Jason Solomons</a>, and for him it is a pleasing change of gear, coming after a mildly puritanical phase in entertainment.</p> <p>“There was a kind of prudishness for a while, or a fear of upsetting people, that has gone away,” he said. “We do need sex in films, after all. If Greed was Good in the 80s of the film <em>Wall Stree</em>t, then Sex is Good now.”</p> <p>Audiences have so far been offered lessons on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/05/how-to-have-sex-review-two-stars-are-born-in-a-searing-study-of-consent-molly-manning-walker-mia-mckenna-bruce\" title=\"\">How to Have Sex</a></em>, courtesy of the British director Molly Manning Walker in a sensitive debut charting a young woman’s initiation, and they have learned about “<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/nov/18/may-december-review-todd-haynes-natatlie-portman-julianne-moore\" title=\"\">May December</a></em>” relationships in Todd Haynes’s film starring Julianne Moore as a woman who has had a relationship with an underage boy. Even <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/18/oppenheimer-beats-barbie-as-bafta-nominations-announced\" title=\"\">Barbie</a></em> and Ken have poked fun at sex, while Christopher Nolan’s camera lens has travelled under the bedcovers for the first time in the Bafta-nominated <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/22/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-volatile-biopic-is-a-towering-achievement-cillian-murphy\" title=\"\">Oppenheimer</a></em>.</p> <p>And showing in cinemas now are <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/saltburn\" title=\"\">Saltburn</a></em>, a sinister sexual jaunt about class, the bold sci-fi romp <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/poor-things-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone\" title=\"\">Poor Thing</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/poor-things-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone\" title=\"\">s,</a> in which Emma Stone plays a promiscuous woman with a baby’s brain, and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/all-of-us-strangers-review-romance\" title=\"\">All of Us Stranger</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/all-of-us-strangers-review-romance\" title=\"\">s</a>, a film about sex and grief, in which actors Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal offer each other physical and emotional comfort.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, Kristen Stewart promises her upcoming thriller, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/06/sundance-film-festival-lineup-2024-kristen-stewart-saoirse-ronan-steven-yeun\" title=\"\">Love Lies Bleedin</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/06/sundance-film-festival-lineup-2024-kristen-stewart-saoirse-ronan-steven-yeun\" title=\"\">g</a>, contains a shocking sex scene in a bathroom between her and co-star Katy O’Brian. Probably more shocking, though, is Stewart’s admission that she enjoyed filming it. “It was really sexy. And I don’t mean from an outsider’s perspective. I felt turned on by it and it was cool to have people witness that,” she has confessed about the film, directed by Rose Glass and out in Britain in April.</p>    <p>Yet some things are still judged beyond the pale. Among various intimate scenes featured in the Golden Globe-winning Poor Things, one was cut down in the final edit. The Board of Film Classification balked at the length of a sequence in the Golden Globe-winning Poor Things which showed two boys watching sex in a Paris brothel. So, by dint of the Protection of Children Act 1978, the censors ruled that an 18 certificate would only be granted if these frames were edited. It turned out director Yorgas Lanthimos had already made these changes in the final edit.</p> <p>“There has always been a lot of sex in films,” said veteran programmer Jane Giles, who selected adventurous titles for London’s legendary Scala cinema and has battled censorship in the past. “It has ebbed and flowed, but it sells, of course, and it is part of life and of drama. And I don’t think anybody would not see a film because a critic said it had too much sex in it.”</p> <p>The current spate of screen sex is notable partly because it contrasts with all the sex-less, hi-tech violence of Hollywood’s endless superhero franchises. But just as remarkable is the way sex is being framed for a contemporary sensibility. It is now often there to shock, amuse or confuse, rather than to titillate or denote romantic love.</p> <p>Directors, from Haynes to <em>Saltburn</em>’s Emerald Fennell, seem as interested in communicating distaste as in providing an erotic thrill. In <em>May December</em> when Natalie Portman’s Elizabeth makes her illicit moves on Charles Melton’s Joe there is little sense of joy, and the disrupting serial seductions of Barry Keoghan’s Oliver in <em>Saltburn</em> are more sabotage than spice.</p>    <p>Giles has watched the graphic depiction of sex move from the arthouse into the chain cinemas, but she celebrates the curiosity of those young teenagers who once used to sneak into the Scala to watch forbidden treasures. Many of them appear in her acclaimed documentary, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/02/scala-review-heartfelt-tribute-to-an-icon-of-independent-cinema#:~:text=Review-,Scala!!!,an%20icon%20of%20independent%20cinema&amp;text=If%20any%20British%20movie,and%20Guardian%20writer%20Ali%20Catterall.\" title=\"\">Scala!!!</a></em>, testifying to the way it broadened their outlook.</p> <p>The censorship of screen sex loosened up in Britain in the early 2000s as the result of a series of public consultations. But rows did flare up, such as when Michael Winterbottom’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/feb/20/features.magazine\" title=\"\">9 Songs</a></em> was released, with its “authentic” sex sequences. “Sex is different to other things an actor is asked to do,” said Giles, acknowledging the element of simulation that has always intrigued. “If they are asked to run, they just run. With sex, they pretend.”</p> <p>So have we finally grown up about sex? Are film directors at last in sync with their audiences, content with both naked male and female bodies, and with the gay sex that crops up on popular shows such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/05/white-lotus-season-three-thailand-parker-posey-jason-isaacs\" title=\"\">White Lotus</a></em>? After all, even the Pope has relaxed on the subject. Speaking in the Vatican last week he described sexual pleasure as “a gift from God”, although he is still not keen on “the demon of lust”.</p> <p>A recent Ofcom survey revealed that British viewers are generally in favour of the changes in how sexual relationships are shown on television. They repeatedly noted that shows were “less likely to include gender stereotyping, objectification of women or uncritical depictions of exploitative relationships” and welcomed the way “intimate scenes are less likely to be portrayed from an exclusively male perspective by default.”</p> <p>It is possible, of course, that these apparently heartening responses merely reflect the inuring effect of all the crass sexual imagery available on the internet, as well as the increasingly explicit content of video games. </p>    <p>In good drama the sex is there to tell the story, but it remains far from free of shame and politics. Even the liberated stars of <em>All of Us Strangers</em>, Andrew Haigh’s acclaimed British film, have admitted a degree of embarrassment about their intimate scenes.</p> <p>Speaking to the BBC, Mescal indicated his concern about giving tickets to his relatives. “They have seen my bum before but there is a little more going on in this movie!’ he said, while his co-star Scott confessed: “I don’t want to be there when my parents watch it!”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston recently incurred the wrath of younger women when she was dismissive about the modern requirement for an “intimacy coordinator” on set for sex scenes.</p> <p>Lanthimos is on the record as happy to have had Elle McAlpine working in this professional role for the stronger sexual content of <em>Poor Things</em>. “She made everything much easier for everyone,” he recognised. And for many female viewers it seems to have worked. His film was nominated this month for a Girls on Film podcast award, which rewards “excellence in woman-focused films in the fields of diversity, inclusion and the representation of women and people of marginalised genders”.</p> <p>Running neck and neck for nominations with Stone’s Bella Baxter for this particular awards event next month is Barbie, played by Margot Robbie. And the two characters make an interesting duo, with clear screen parallels. Both are childlike naifs, let loose in the cruel world, encountering philosophy and male oppression as they go. For some viewers this element makes the sex, or “furious jumping”, shown in <em>Poor Things</em> tricky to accept, despite the fact it is all based on an acclaimed Scottish literary classic by Alasdair Gray. “I felt queasy in those scenes,” said Solomons. “I understand Bella is meant to be a proto-feminist, but she is basically a child having sex in the early scenes and, although I was not offended, I felt these were choppy waters for Lanthimos.”</p>    <p>The sexual agency of Stone’s infantile character was also questioned on BBC Radio 4, with particular reference to the brothel scenes. The actor, also a co-producer, defended the portrayal of Bella, telling <em>Front Row</em>’s Samira Ahmed she is supposed to be “completely free and without shame about her body”.</p> <p>Whatever the sexual and social politics, the entertainment industry is clearly moving away from deploying sex scenes as an obligatory component, like a car chase. No longer do these bits of choreographed action simply go through the motions, with audiences as relieved as the characters once it is over. The sex-by-numbers era was depressing and did not mark much creative progress from the repressive Hays Code days of Hollywood, when even married characters were required to keep one foot on the floor in the bedroom. Back then somehow, perhaps because of the restrictions, sex was fun; nice as well as naughty. In the 1934 romantic comedy <em>It Happened One Night </em>a spoiled heiress, played by Claudette Colbert, is forced to spend the night in a hotel room with Clark Gable, a man she has met on a bus, separated only by a sheet hung as a screen between them. The sexual tension has crackled down the decades.</p> <p>By the 1970s the bedlinen was permanently raised and nude sex was de rigueur. Not all of it was nice though. Giles still cannot watch the brutal killing of the sexually adventurous woman in 1977’s <em>Looking for Mr Goodbar</em>, and points out the “feelbad” sexual dynamic of popular box office hits, including <em>Saturday Night Fever</em>.</p> <p>The 1980s saw increasing fears about the impact of “video nasties” and the pornography suddenly available in the home; something that peculiarly happened in tandem with the overt linking of erotic sex and murderous violence in mainstream cinema hits such as <em>Fatal Attraction</em> and <em>Basic Instinct</em>.</p> <p>While the latest brand of film sex is sometimes weaponised, there seems a wiser acceptance of its moral ambiguities and destabilising power.</p> <p>Among the acclaimed new releases, perhaps only <em>All of Us Strangers </em>shows physical intimacy as a potentially healing force. But it chiefly satisfies the demands of the story, rather than merely emitting an erotic charge.<br><br></p>",

            "body" : "<p>The key question raised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/13/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office-why-it-took-a-tv-series-to-bring-the-post-office-scandal-to-light\">Horizon story</a> is whether it’s a scandal or a crisis. Why is that important? Simply this: although scandals generate controversy, shock, anguish and anger, they don’t result in significant change. After a while, the public becomes bored, the media caravan moves on – to the next story, the next scandal; politicians piously declare that “lessons have been learned” (though heads rarely roll), and so on. Crises, on the other hand, <em>do</em> lead to systemic change, at least in working democracies. Laws change, institutions are closed or radically reformed, culprits go to jail… life does not go on as before.</p> <p>There’s no question that the Post Office’s inhumane treatment of sub-postmasters constituted an egregious scandal. And initially there were indications that it might actually have become a crisis. Just a week after <em><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/watch/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office/10a0469\">Mr Bates vs </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/watch/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office/10a0469\">the Post Office</a></em> aired on ITV, for example, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-67926661/page/3\">the prime minister announced</a> that the government would be introducing a new law to quickly exonerate and compensate the victims of “one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history”.</p> <p>A whole new law, eh? Maybe this scandal <em>is</em> a crisis after all. Not so fast. Although we don’t know the detail yet, it will just be a piece of legislation to right a specific wrong – a bit like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Dogs_Act_1991\">Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991</a>, say. But it will do nothing about the systemic problems that led to the mistakes and injustices in the first place.</p> <p>First, there’s clearly something radically wrong with the corporate governance of the Post Office, whose senior executives, having signed off on the purchase of a flawed software system, then persisted in denying that it was flawed, and that any discrepancies that it logged must be because of criminal behaviour by users.</p> <p>Then there’s the legal precedent that places the burden of proof upon a defendant to demonstrate why the output from a computer should not be relied upon as a true statement of fact. “The presumption,” as <a href=\"https://barristermagazine.com/evidence-from-computers-the-unreliable-legal-presumption-that-without-more-it-can-be-relied-upon/\">one barrister puts it</a>, “effectively ‘magics’ computer output into truth – a privilege rarely accorded other species of hearsay evidence.”</p> <p>Speaking of the law raises another issue: why has there not been legal action against Fujitsu, the supplier of the flawed system? In the Commons on Tuesday, Paul Patterson, the company’s Europe chief executive, was in full damage-limitation mode. Fujitsu was “truly sorry” and had a “moral obligation” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82d8ebc7-5fbc-4bc0-8f8b-9f4d18f49d5e\">to help fund</a> redress for sub-postmasters. Aw, shucks. Kevin Hollinrake, the postal affairs minister, said that negotiations with Fujitsu would take place following the conclusion of a public inquiry.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The British state has been hollowed out to the point where it is so dependent on corporations, it dare not rein them in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Good luck with that: the government has a dismal track record in such negotiations. Fujitsu, you see, is a key “<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-suppliers/crown-representatives-and-strategic-suppliers\">strategic supplier</a>” to the government. It makes around £100m a year from this work, and has <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2024-01-08/fujitsu-has-won-more-than-150-government-contracts-since-horizon-scandal\">won 150 new contracts</a> worth £2.04bn since the 2019 court ruling that Fujitsu’s Horizon IT system caused accounting errors that were blamed on the unfortunate sub-postmasters. Clients for these lucrative contracts include the Home Office, HMRC, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Work and Pensions. And then of course there’s the £2.4bn lifetime contract Fujitsu has with the Post Office for the Horizon system.</p> <p>Fujitsu has been lucratively sucking on the government’s teats for quite a while. The <em>Financial Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b5c9a75-72e7-45bc-a202-7172d35e9f54\">reports</a> that sometime during the 2010-2015 coalition government, the Cabinet Office “pushed to formally exclude Fujitsu and other companies from bidding for government deals on the basis of their performance in previous contracts, according to three current and former Whitehall insiders”. Another insider told the paper that “Project Sushi”, a bid to blacklist a group of IT giants regarded as having performed poorly, had focused heavily on Fujitsu. But the push was ultimately unsuccessful because “government lawyers advised that it would not be legally possible to discriminate against companies based on their past performance”.</p> <p>So you can perhaps see why Rishi Sunak might be reluctant to sue Fujitsu for compensation for the sub-postmasters whose lives have been wrecked by their flawed system. The truth is that the British state has been hollowed out to the point where it is so dependent on the corporations to which it has outsourced critical services and functions that it dare not rein them in. And, as if to underscore the point, Fujitsu, which in 2016 was awarded a £4.6m contract to run the country’s flood warning system, this month <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/04/fujitsu_flood_contract_extension/\">got a £2m extension</a> after the Environment Agency experienced difficulty finding a replacement supplier.</p> <p>So it looks as though the Horizon scandal was just that – a scandal. Sad but inevitable in a neoliberal world.

            "body" : "<p>The bed was covered with baby clothes neatly arranged with milestone cards for future events such as “coming home” and “Easter”. They were the outfits for all the special occasions Tara Maguire thought she would miss with her daughter Maisie, then just two weeks old. Downstairs her husband and mother-in-law were waiting to drive her to be admitted as an inpatient at the Bluestone psychiatric unit of Craigavon Area hospital in Northern Ireland. “It was really hard,” recalls Tara, wiping away tears.</p> <p>Tara had postpartum psychosis, one of the mental health conditions that affect 10-20% of mothers either during pregnancy or the year after – the “perinatal” period. They include depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis. Many factors make women more vulnerable to mental illness during this period, from changes in hormone levels and the brain, physical and psychological stress and traumas during birth, the sheer magnitude of this life event, or a potential genetic vulnerability.</p> <p>While treatment can be vital to limit the impact on the mother, her baby, her partner and other children, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/05/huge-delays-to-access-maternal-mental-health-care-in-england-called-a-scandal\">accessing it can be a postcode lottery</a>. Hence there was cautious optimism in October when the Northern Irish <a href=\"https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/news/update-community-perinatal-mental-health-services\">Department of Health announced</a> Belfast City hospital as the site of Northern Ireland’s first mother and baby unit (MBU). There are <a href=\"https://www.app-network.org/get-help/mother-and-baby-unit/\">19 MBUs in England</a> where mothers can be admitted for mental health treatment with their newborns, two in Scotland and one in Wales.</p> <p>“We know that the existence of MBUs are the first things that women want, they are the most important things for rapid recovery,” says Dr Jess Heron, a senior research fellow in perinatal psychiatry at the University of Birmingham, who set up <a href=\"https://www.app-network.org/\">Action on Postpartum Psychosis</a> (APP), a national charity that campaigned for the new unit. However, she adds: “We need to know a timeframe; we need something to happen now.”</p>    <p>Postpartum psychosis is one of the more severe mental health conditions affecting one to two in every 1,000 who give birth. It can manifest as depression, mania, severe anxiety, confusion, catatonia, or a mixture of these symptoms, but it is the hallucinations, delusions and loss of touch with reality that define the condition. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder before pregnancy or among immediate family members is the strongest known risk factor, but as Heron explains, for half of the women who experience the condition, “The first episode comes out of the blue with no history at all.”</p> <p>Tara had been “buzzing” in the days after her daughter’s birth, when she was readmitted to the hospital’s maternity unit for anaemia. Although she mellowed during visits from her husband, Chris – rare because of Covid restrictions – her complete lack of sleep and manic behaviour had her flagged for possible postpartum psychosis when she was discharged into the care of the mental health team that supports people within the community. No one in her family had any inkling of the suspected condition, and when the mental health team left Chris an emergency contact number for psychiatric help he stuffed it in the pocket of the chair, thinking he would never need it. It wasn’t until Tara nudged Chris awake at night that he realised something was definitely wrong. “Is it time?” she had asked. “To smother the baby?” Tara’s head was filled with choirs of angels telling her Maisie was too good for this world, but knowing she could not bring herself to kill her baby she had thought she could enlist Chris. He reached straight for the emergency number.</p> <p>For many women and their families in the UK, help is available. In 1997-1999, the then Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) included suicides in its report for the first time. Although incomplete, the data, supplemented with figures from the Office for National Statistics, suggested <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/suicide-the-leading-cause-of-maternal-death/7D7D78E8E7F515E2749C21366BF00C71\">suicide was the leading cause of death</a> in the first year after pregnancy. This is still the case, though focus on maternal mental health has gradually increased over the subsequent two decades with the launch of initiatives such as APP and the <a href=\"https://maternalmentalhealthalliance.org/\">Maternal Mental Health Alliance</a>. Outside the UK, including many states in the US and Europe, maternal deaths from suicide are often still not counted.</p> <p>“We’ve done loads of educating over the last couple of decades to improve the knowledge in the health professionals, primary care professionals, midwifery, health visiting, obstetrician, social care and mental health specialists,” says the consultant adult and perinatal psychiatrist and registrar of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Trudi Seneviratne. Specialist perinatal mental health teams now operate in every locality in the UK, compared with just 40% of <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/suicide-the-leading-cause-of-maternal-death/7D7D78E8E7F515E2749C21366BF00C71\">localities in Scotland </a>and just 15% <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/perinatal-mental-health-services-supporting-pregnant-women-and-new-mothers\">in England 10 years ago</a>.</p> <p>When Heron set up APP in 2010, postpartum psychosis accounted for 43% of maternal suicides, yet fear, shame and stigma were preventing women from speaking out about inadequate support. More than a decade on, after work by charities such as APP, <a href=\"https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/assets/downloads/mbrrace-uk/reports/maternal-report-2022/MBRRACE-UK_Maternal_MAIN_Report_2022_UPDATE.pdf\">psychosis is now rarely a cause of death</a>. In the 2023 APP peer support survey, 46% of respondents said: “I might not be alive if I had not found APP’s peer support services.” However, deaths because of other causes have increased.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women who die by suicide have often contacted different bits of the health service in mental distress several times</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Marian Knight</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The CEMD – now run by Mbrrace-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk Through Audits and Confidential Enquiries), based at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) at the University of Oxford – released new figures for 2019-2021 last October, which state that of the more than 2 million women who gave birth, 572 died during or within a year of pregnancy. Of those deaths, 39% were caused by psychiatric conditions, including drug or alcohol abuse, and 19% were because of suicide,<strong> </strong>still the leading cause of death between six weeks and a year after pregnancy.</p> <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-for-england-2023-to-2028/suicide-prevention-in-england-5-year-cross-sector-strategy\">five-year suicide prevention strategy</a>, announced last September, specifically targeted pregnant women and new mothers, noting that “the high risk compared with other causes of maternal death (most of which are rare) and the potential long-term consequences on children’s development mean we must take action to prevent suicides in this group”.</p>    <p>Chris still struggles, two and a half years later, to understand how Tara could have been discharged without anyone mentioning that the consultant suspected postpartum psychosis. Nor was it mentioned in their antenatal classes – they had never heard of it before. “We were completely blind,” Tara says. Although all the NHS workers involved “bent over backwards” to try to help, “the left hand just did not know what the right hand was doing”, says Chris.</p> <p>This, according to Prof Marian Knight, the director of the NPEU, “is regularly identified as a challenge”. She adds: “Women who die by suicide have often contacted different bits of the health service in mental distress several times and nobody’s picked up the overall pattern of deteriorating mental health.”</p> <p>Suicide or, in extremely rare incidents, infanticide are the worst-case scenarios, but other long-term impacts remain. “There are association studies between depression and anxiety and the child subsequently developing cognitive problems, behavioural problems, IQ deficiencies,” says Seneviratne, adding that the children themselves can go on to develop psychological problems.</p> <p>A 2014 report put the <a href=\"https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/59885/1/__lse.ac.uk_storage_LIBRARY_Secondary_libfile_shared_repository_Content_Bauer%2C%20M_Bauer_Costs_perinatal_%20mental_2014_Bauer_Costs_perinatal_mental_2014_author.pdf\">net long-term cost of perinatal depression, anxiety and psychosis at £8.1bn</a> for each one-year cohort of births in the UK; 72% of this related to adverse outcomes for the child. However, Seneviratne says the associations are complex. “We don’t want parents to feel guilty.”</p> <p>When the economy suffers, people suffer more. Depression (often accompanied by anxiety) affects roughly 15% of mothers during or within a year of pregnancy, but among disadvantaged communities the proportion is significantly higher.</p> <p>While people come to Dr Cerith Waters, an NHS perinatal clinical psychologist and researcher at the University of Cardiff, for therapy – which is happening more and more during the current cost of living crisis – he has found himself directing them to where they can access safe housing, baby clothes or a buggy. “Supporting people to get their social and basic needs met is increasingly an issue for our most vulnerable families before they’re ready for, and have the head space to engage in, psychological therapy,” he says.</p> <p>Studies have also shown that people respond well to treatment during the perinatal period, which benefits the child as well. A 2020 analysis of 16 studies identified <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/abs/review-and-analysis-of-the-components-of-potentially-effective-perinatal-mental-health-interventions-for-infant-development-and-motherinfant-relationship-outcomes/73FC3D26B833FE33BAE80A35D0A0BF9F\">eight interventions that led to improvements for the infant and the infant-mother relationship</a>, highlighting the apparent benefits of interventions that encourage positive interactions between mother and infant, for example, helping mothers to understand their infant’s perspective.</p>    <p>“It represents a wonderful opportunity to make a difference,” says Waters. Treatments can include talking and creative therapies, and improving diet, exercise and sleep. Medications such as antidepressants can also help, although the <a href=\"https://www.birminghamhealthpartners.co.uk/healthy-mum-healthy-baby-healthy-future-report/\">lack of clinical trials</a> in pregnant or breastfeeding women makes it harder to balance the risks and benefits of medicines <a href=\"https://www.birminghamhealthpartners.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Final-Healthy-Mum-Healthy-Baby-Healthy-Future-Report-AW_Accessible-PDF-REDUCED-FILE-SIZE.pdf\">to mother and baby</a>.</p> <p>For Tara, medication was not enough. Feeling she was no longer safe at home, Chris had her admitted. Had Tara gone into an MBU with her newborn as soon as red flags of potential postpartum psychosis were noted, much subsequent trauma might have been avoided, she suggests. These units admit the mother and baby together so that the mother has access to the psychiatric and psychological treatment she needs alongside postnatal physical care, with nurses on hand to care for the baby and support bonding and parenting behaviour. Being among other mothers of newborn babies in an MBU can also be a support.</p> <p>As it was, Tara was admitted into a general psychiatric unit. “It looked like a prison cell with a hospital bed,” says Chris.</p> <p>Heron says: “Being forcibly separated from your newborn can be terrifying, especially when mentally unwell, and this can impede treatment and recovery.”</p> <p>Despite improvements in recent years, many still fear the reaction of friends, families and even social services if they make their experience of postpartum psychosis or other mental illnesses known. This poses a barrier not just to public awareness but also access to support and treatment. “You’re only going to get better if you’re properly treated,” says Knight. “That means speaking up.”</p> <p>One of the striking characteristics of postpartum psychosis is how well people do recover. Speaking to Tara now, there is little trace of the severe condition she experienced. But, she says: “What I’m worried about is that mummies take their own lives to protect their kids because they’re terrified of their own minds.”</p> <ul> <li><p>In the UK, the charity <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a> is available on 0300 123 3393 and <a href=\"https://www.childline.org.uk/\">Childline</a> on 0800 1111.

But when they applied for the children’s visas, the applications were rejected.</p> <p>In refusal letters seen by the <em>Observer</em>, the Home Office questioned why the children could not stay permanently with their grandparents or other relatives. In other cases, it said there was no reason why they could not go to live with their fathers, even though their mothers had sole custody or the fathers had not seen the children for years. Many of the letters, addressed directly to the children, conclude: “It was your mother’s personal decision to depart for the UK and you have not provided sufficient evidence to grant your visa on serious or compelling grounds.”</p> <p>The cases have come to light weeks after the government announced a plan to slash immigration by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/04/five-point-plan-to-cut-uk-immigration-raises-fears-of-more-nhs-staff-shortages\" title=\"\">placing restrictions on the dependants </a>of migrant healthcare workers. Under controversial rules expected to be introduced this spring, care workers coming to the UK will be barred from bringing family members, while other health workers will have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/22/revised-salary-threshold-uk-visas-families\" title=\"\">earn £29,000 a year, rising to £38,700 in 2025, to be permitted to do so</a>.</p> <p>But scores of applications from such workers are already being quietly refused. The <em>Observer</em> has examined 10 cases, and been alerted to 140 more, where migrant women, all single mothers, have had visas for children denied in the past 18 months.</p> <p>The applications have not been rejected because the Home Office doubts they are genuine or that the women are the children’s primary caregivers. Instead, they have been refused under a Home Office rule that a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has “sole responsibility”.</p> <p>The policy means single parents are required to prove not only that they have sole custody but that the other parent is not involved in their child’s upbringing – something experts say can be hard to do.</p> <p>If the sole responsibility threshold is not met, the Home Office can still grant applications if it believes there are compelling or compassionate grounds. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/11/why-home-office-visa-plans-nail-in-coffin-uk-hospitality\">Why Home Office visa plans will be ‘nail in the coffin’ for UK hospitality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as yet, it has declined to do so in the women’s cases investigated by the <em>Observer</em>, which has seen extensive evidence to support the mothers’ claims that they are their children’s sole caregivers.</p> <p>In many cases, the women gave the Home Office court documents and custody papers proving they were the sole custodian, as well as bank statements, insurance policies, photos and letters of support from schools, doctors and church leaders.</p>    <p>Many also have signed consent letters from their children’s fathers, but in some cases this has been used against them. One mother, Getty, had a visa for her six-year-old daughter denied. The care worker from Zambia says she and the girl’s father separated when she was pregnant and she has always been her sole caregiver.</p> <p>Shortly after she arrived in Britain in March, Getty, 36, submitted an application for her child to join her. She supplied documents including a court order linked to her separation and an affidavit from the girl’s father saying it would be in the child’s best interests to come to Britain. But the Home Office refused the child a visa, saying the fact her father had provided a consent letter was proof he was still in her life and could therefore look after her.</p> <p>Getty said the separation had taken a huge toll, adding: “My daughter asks me every day when her papers are going to be ready. I have to be honest with her and tell her: ‘I’m still waiting.’ She is only used to living with me. It’s really, really hard.”</p> <p>In another case, an NHS nurse who provided the Home Office with a court document proving she had sole custody for her two daughters, aged four and 13, was told there were no “serious or compelling reasons” why the girls needed to join her. “It’s heartbreaking. How can I sleep at night?” she said. “I am the mother of the children and I have always looked after them.”</p>    <p>Patricia Chinyoka, chief executive of the Women of Zimbabwe project, which is supporting many of the women, described the refusals as “absolutely appalling”.</p> <p>“Some of the women have supplied an amazing array of proof and then they still get a letter saying: ‘We don’t believe you.’ They have sold properties, left jobs – they’ve sold up and come here and this is what they are now faced with,” Chinyoka said. “They don’t know what to do.”</p> <p>It is not the first time the sole responsibility test has faced scrutiny. In November, a Kenyan expert in world literature at Bristol University was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/11/kenyan-expert-bristol-university-denied-visa-daughter\" title=\"\">refused a visa for her six-year-old daughter</a>. The decision was later reversed. In 2019, two other similar cases were also reversed.</p> <p>Sairah Javed, a solicitor at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said a helpline the campaigning charity runs with the Unison trade union had seen a “categoric rise” in such refusals in recent months, with about 20 last year compared with five in previous years.</p> <p>Most related to single mothers in the healthcare sector. “We’re seeing a lot of pain and heartache for people who have come to the UK in accordance with all our rules,” Javed said. “It’s quite inhumane. It’s just another form of assault on family values.”</p> <p>Liberal Democrat peer Sally Hamwee, chair of the justice and home affairs committee in the Lords, called for the policy to be revised. Lady Hamwee said: “It does not recognise how families operate in the 21st century and is causing huge distress and harm to adults and children who are swept up in it.”</p> <p>The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases. It said: “The sole responsibility rule is a long-term government policy and all visa applications are carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with immigration rules.”</p>",

Other days, the younger girl, aged four, asks difficult questions like, “When can you send the aeroplane to come and get us, Mummy?” “It’s heartbreaking,” Yvonne says. “I don’t know what to do.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/20/inhumane-home-office-denying-visas-to-children-of-migrant-health-workers\">‘Inhumane’ Home Office denying visas to children of migrant health workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yvonne is one of dozens of migrant women who have been refused permission for their children to join them in Britain. Despite current rules permitting healthcare workers to bring family members, single mothers, many of them recruited to work in the NHS and care sector, are routinely having their applications denied.</p> <p>The applications are being refused under a decades-old Home Office rule that a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has sole responsibility. Many of the approximately 150 women who have come forward so far have supplied extensive evidence showing they are the children’s primary caregivers. But the applications have still been refused.</p> <p>Yvonne says she moved to Britain to improve her family’s future. “We’re searching for greener pastures, to give our kids a better life,” the 34-year-old says. Before departing, she says, her employer reassured her that it should be simple enough for her daughters to join her.</p> <p>So in March 2023 she left the girls in the temporary care of a nanny and boarded a flight. Two months later, after securing accommodation and starting her new job, she applied to the Home Office for the children’s visas.</p> <p>Documents shared with the <em>Observer </em>show she explained that she had always cared for the girls, they had always lived with her, and supplied references from their schools, doctors and grandmother, along with consent letters from the other parent.</p> <p>The application was rejected on the grounds that the girls could live with other relatives, and that Yvonne had not provided “compelling reasons” for them to come.</p> <p>Ten months after she arrived, she is still battling the Home Office to reverse its decision. The girls are in the care of their grandparents, but Yvonne says this is not a long-term fix. “My parents are both in a bad position physically. They can’t carry the burden of looking after a four-year-old,” she says. “I have looked after my children all their lives. And now to be told I don’t have reason to live with them … that is the most painful thing.”</p> <p>Another mother, Juliet Mupeni, said her 13-year-old son had been traumatised by the decision not to let him come. Mupeni, 37, a former university lecturer in cybersecurity, who moved from Zimbabwe in May to work as a live-in carer, supplied detailed evidence showing she is the boy’s sole caregiver, including a letter from the Zimbabwean authorities stating she has, and always has had, sole parental responsibility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/29/uk-ministers-considering-limit-foreign-care-worker-dependants-migration\"> UK ministers considering limit on foreign care workers’ dependants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She also supplied letters from his school, doctor and church pastor, and a consent letter from the boy’s father, who she says she separated from a decade ago. But the Home Office rejected the application, questioning why the boy, who is staying with a family friend, couldn’t live with his dad.</p> <p>Mupeni submitted a fresh application with further proof, but this, too, was refused. In a cruel twist, the rejection letter said the fact the child had been without his mother since she moved to Britain was proof he did not need to come. “My son feels I have abandoned him. After the second refusal he was very very emotional. He was crying for several days,” she says. “I moved here specifically for his future. If I thought he couldn’t join me I wouldn’t have come.”</p> <p>In another case, a mother who was refused permission for her son to join her was told that as the boy’s father had contact with the child “occasionally and sporadically”, this was proof he could stay with him. The Home Office also said a letter saying the child’s grandmother had “chronic conditions” and could not care for the child long-term was not detailed enough, concluding there were no “compassionate and compelling circumstances” to grant the visa.</p> <p>In other cases, women were asked to provide further evidence to support their applications so applied for court documents in their home countries. They had not needed them before as their separations or custody arrangements were informal. But the Home Office said that as the documents were dated recently, they had only been obtained for the purposes of securing a visa and refused the applications.</p> <p>Carol, 39, a care worker also from Zimbabwe, who has been denied a visa for her 17-year-old daughter, said: “I don’t know why they are doing this. It is like we are not human beings. It’s like our families don’t mean as much as the families we are coming to look after.”</p> <p>Lawyers and charities are calling for the cases to be reviewed, and the Home Office approach to be modernised, so that caseworkers give more weight to what is in the children’s best interests.</p> <p>Current Home Office guidance does allow for exceptions, telling caseworkers that even if the sole responsibility test is not met, they can still allow visas if there are compassionate grounds to do so.</p> <p>It explicitly says that a consent letter from the other parent would count in favour of their case. Yet many of the women providing such evidence are still having their children’s visas declined. Applicants can apply for a review but these can be costly, take several months and look only at whether administrative errors were made.</p> <p>Sacha Wooldridge, head of immigration at law firm Birketts, said the sole responsibility test was intended to protect the other parent’s rights, but that it did not recognise “today’s modern society” and could be a “very blunt instrument”.</p> <p>The Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association says the “sole responsibility” test is “completely out of step with current best practice”. Last year, the cross-party peers on the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs committee said the policy was tearing apart families and should be revised.</p> <p>Another mother, Amara, who moved from South Africa to Cheshire to work as a live-in carer, urged the Home Office to review the decisions and “show compassion”.</p> <p>She has been fighting since July for her daughters, 12 and 14, to join her. “When I heard about the UK needing healthcare workers I thought, ‘OK, I would love to go and help out there.’ But it feels like the UK doesn’t care about us,” she said. “I would love the Home Office to be considerate and empathetic. I would ask them to put themselves in my shoes.”</p>",

Just six days earlier, Brooks had been enjoying a game of golf in eastern Spain in bright sunshine near his home. He sought treatment the next day for shoulder pain, and was given a painkiller injection of the drug metamizole at a local clinic.</p> <p>Two days after the injection, he was admitted to hospital in the town of Torrevieja in Alicante province with suspected depleted white blood cells. Three days after the jab, he was in intensive care with failing organs. Five days after it, he was dead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/26/painkiller-banned-in-uk-linked-to-britons-deaths-in-spain\">‘They thought I had cancer’: painkiller banned in UK linked to Britons’ deaths in Spain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The whole thing is a blur, like a bad dream,” said Moses, 38, who is now left to raise their four-year-old daughter, Aurora, on her own as the sole earner. “I couldn’t believe how this happened in less than a week. He was bouncing around, excited about the golf, and then he’s gone.</p> <p>“How could this have happened? No one should be dying after a shoulder pain from golf. It’s senseless. He had everything to live for, and we’ve been left to pick up the pieces. It’s not just Mark’s life. It is our lives as well.”</p> <p>With the help of the campaign group the <a href=\"https://www.adafspain.org/\" title=\"\">Association of Drug Affected Patients</a> (ADAF) in Spain, Moses obtained the medical notes. On the first page of the documents seen by the <em>Observer</em>, it states: “apparent allergic reaction to metamizole”.</p> <p>The case is the latest death involving metamizole in Spain, where it is sold under the brand name Nolotil. One Spanish regional health department has already warned that it should not be a first-choice painkiller, because of the risk of adverse side-effects. It is already banned in more than 30 countries, including Britain.</p> <p>ADAF is taking legal action over the use of the drug in Spain and briefed a British consul from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on the case in November.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/26/painkiller-banned-in-uk-linked-to-britons-deaths-in-spain\" title=\"\">investigation by the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/26/painkiller-banned-in-uk-linked-to-britons-deaths-in-spain\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em> in November revealed concerns over adverse reactions to the drug. There have been more than 40 deaths in Spain in which metamizole may have led to or contributed to death, including those of many Britons. Case reports in medical journals suggest certain populations may be more susceptible to the side-effects.</p> <p>Brooks, 42, a handyman and gardener who lived in Ciudad Quesada in Alicante and was originally from Chesterfield in Derbyshire, suffered a suspected reaction after the metamizole injection at a local clinic. When he got home, a rash developed at the injection site on his left buttock, his skin was starting to blister and there was swelling around his shoulder.</p> <p>Moses was so worried she took him to the accident and emergency unit of the local hospital. The medical notes record blistering and swelling around the buttock area. “Blood tests show a tendency towards leukopenia [associated with a low white blood cell count] with signs of kidney failure, in addition to liver failure.”</p> <p>Brooks rapidly deteriorated. By Thursday, he had slipped into a coma, and on Friday, Moses was told it was only the life support systems that were keeping him alive. “They said it was caused by an infection and the injection was the catalyst, but no one could tell me why,” she said.</p> <p>Brooks died on Friday 20 October last year. The death certificate records the causes as multiple organ failure, septic shock and cellulitis.</p> <p>His death is just the latest case of British and Irish people in Spain<strong> </strong>where metamizole is known or suspected to have been a contributory factor. Others include:</p> <p>• Mary Ward, 59, originally from Harlow, Essex, who was administered Nolotil in 2001, wiping out her white blood cells. She was on a ventilator for eight months, destroying her throat, and suffered from complications for years before dying in March 2006.</p> <p>• Susan Earwaker, 62, who lived in Murcia, south-east Spain, who was given Nolotil after breaking her leg in a horse accident. She died in January 2015 of sepsis and organ failure, with medical files recording an adverse reaction to the drug.</p> <p>• Billy Smyth, 66, a keen cyclist, from Mullingar, Ireland,<strong> </strong>who died in Spain from an adverse reaction to Nolotil in April 2016. He died of organ failure.</p> <p>• Lorna Vincent, 75, who went to hospital for a bowel operation and was given metamizole. Her white cells were depleted and she died in April 2018 of organ failure. The family believes the drug was involved and is seeking her medical records.</p> <p>Spain’s medicine and health products agency, the AEMPS, says the risk of agranulocytosis from metamizole, in which white blood cells are severely depleted, is very rare, in the range of one to 10 cases per million users. It says the benefits of the popular painkiller outweigh the risk.</p> <p>There are, however, significant variations in these estimates. When the drug was withdrawn in Sweden in 1999, regulators estimated the risk of agranulocytosis at about one in every 2,000 prescriptions, with a mortality rate of 26%, concluding that the benefit-risk profile was unfavourable.</p>    <p>The reasons for these variations are unclear, but some research has suggested certain populations may be more susceptible to adverse reactions. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19457324/\" title=\"\">A 2009 study</a> at the Costa del Sol hospital in Marbella concluded: “Dipyrone-related agranulocytosis is an adverse effect more frequent in [the] British population, and its use must be avoided.”</p> <p>Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes Nolotil, says other adverse side-effects, including infections, are listed on the drug information sheet. It says the current prescribing information “adequately addresses current knowledge about risks”.</p> <p>“Every drug has a risk, but it’s not clear enough for people to make a decision on it,” said Derek Smyth, 49, the son of Billy Smyth. “There has not been enough reporting done on it, especially if there is a category of people who are at higher risk.”</p> <p>The drug should only be available in Spain on prescription, but in November the <em>Observer</em> was able to buy two packets of Nolotil at a chemist in Jávea on the Costa Blanca for less than €4, without a prescription. “They hand this drug out without any questions even though it is banned in many other countries,” said Graeme Ward, 81, who lost his wife, Mary, who took the drug. “It should be banned.”</p> <p>Vicente Palop Larrea, a doctor specialising in fibromyalgia who helped set up the Valencia region’s pharmaceutical safety authority in the 1980s, said: “Metamizole continues to be dispensed without a prescription. It is prescribed in doses higher than those recommended, without taking into account the greater susceptibility of some people to suffer from agranulocytosis.” He said he was concerned that adverse drug reactions were under-reported.</p> <p>He added: “Do not prescribe it to patients from other countries where the drug has been withdrawn because of the increased risk of agranulocytosis associated with metamizole in those groups.” He said the Spanish health authorities also needed to think about the intramuscular injections because of the reported risks of lesions, necrosis and sepsis.</p> <p>Cristina García del Campo, founder of ADAF, said there needed to be a comprehensive national study in Spain to establish the adverse side-effects of metamizole. “Most of the cases of adverse drug reactions from metamizole are never reported,” she said. “Until a proper study is done, they should withdraw the drug or only administer it under the tightest restrictions and with proper monitoring.”</p> <p>The Spanish ministry of health and the university hospital in Torrevieja, where Mark Brooks was treated, had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.</p> <p>Boehringer Ingelheim said: “Patient safety is our top priority, and we actively monitor the safety of our products on an ongoing basis and notify health authorities if new safety information becomes available.</p> <p>“The side-effect of agranulocytosis is addressed in the current product information. The product is available on medical prescription only so that therapy is under supervision of a physician.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 January 2024.

obviously the first two goals, the corner kicks, we can be a bit aggrieved about that because there was a potential foul in both of those … until the last 10, 15 minutes, at 3-0 we were staying in the game … of course the last two goals aggravate the score enormously and make everything look even worse than it was … we deserved to lose the game because we played against a much better team … we stuck at it … the last two goals lend a suggestion that we didn’t stick at it and that’s unfortunate … games tend to [unravel] if you’re 3-0 down and especially if you make substitutions and the players we put on are young or without experience … obviously I should be more careful and protect the 3-0 … we’re going through a very bad spell … we were hoping to kick on and that’s not happened … fans are always entitled to their opinions … they care and want to see a strong Palace team … today they were entitled to make their opinions felt … but I’m afraid there are times when we look at it from our position, the team and myself, and what more can we do with the people that we’re trying to put on the field … it’s not always that easy … managers always take the full brunt of it … it makes me feel a bit sad and disappointed because I feel we’re doing the best job we could possibly do … but I’m a manager of a football club that isn’t in a very good position so everything that happens to managers in that position will happen to me … first we’ve got to stay in the league … success will also be getting back to the type of football I know we can play … but we have to get some of the players back who help us enormously … the people who make decisions about whether we can bring more players in will have seen the game today … they will have seen the situation we find ourselves in …

place, level on points with Manchester City. But it’s nothing short of a disaster for Roy Hodgson. Already under pressure, his team have been utterly outplayed this afternoon, and he stands stock still, staring at the banner held up by his own fans eviscerating the state of Crystal Palace right now. He looks emotional. His team remain in 14th spot, but they’re only five points better off than Luton Town, who have a game in hand. They’ve got too much talent to get themselves involved in a relegation battle … but we’ve all heard that one before.

            "body" : "<p>Two decades after Scott Peterson was sentenced to death for the murder of his pregnant wife in a high-profile trial, the Los Angeles Innocence Project said this week that it had taken up the case.</p> <p>The development marks a significant breakthrough for the 51-year-old, who has long maintained his innocence and has claimed he received an unfair trial.</p> <p>In court filings this week, which were first reported by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/innocence-project-takes-case-notorious-killer-scott-peterson/story?id=106487571\">ABC News</a>, the project, which seeks to exonerate those who have been wrongfully convicted, argued that new evidence supports Peterson’s “claim of actual innocence” and “raises many questions into who abducted and killed Laci and Conner Peterson”.</p> <p>It is unclear what that newly discovered evidence is.</p> <p>The non-profit said that it was taking up Peterson’s representation and was “investigating his claim of actual innocence”.</p> <p>The case gripped America, drawing national attention almost immediately. Peterson’s wife, Laci Peterson, went missing from her home in Modesto, California, on Christmas Eve 2002, when she was eight months pregnant. The remains of Laci and her unborn child were recovered in April 2003 in the San Francisco Bay.</p> <p>Law enforcement officials quickly homed in on Peterson. It was revealed he had engaged in multiple affairs. One woman he had an affair with came forward publicly, saying Peterson had claimed he was a widower before his wife’s disappearance. It would became a central part of prosecutors’ case.</p> <p>During the closely watched trial, the prosecution argued Peterson smothered his wife around Christmas Eve in order to be with his mistress, and transported her body into a newly purchased fishing boat before dumping her into the bay.</p> <p>Peterson said his wife was alive when he left to go fishing in Berkeley on the morning of Christmas Eve. His defense team argued that Laci was kidnapped and Peterson was framed for the killing.</p> <p>Prosecutors had little forensic science evidence but were able to convince the jury with a wealth of circumstantial evidence. A jury sentenced Peterson to death after 12 hours of deliberations.</p> <p>The California supreme court overturned that sentence in 2020 after it found that potential jurors were erroneously dismissed for saying they objected to the death penalty, but ultimately upheld the conviction. Peterson was resentenced to life without the possibility of parole.</p> <p>In 2022, a judge rejected Peterson’s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-0a1f50714ef42ff1da8dfc9bf5024f0b\">request</a> for a new trial. Peterson had alleged that his trial was tainted by a juror who lied about her history of abuse.</p> <p>In the court filings this week, the Los Angeles Innocence Project said it was seeking evidence from the 2004 trial that it was unable to find among trial files from Peterson’s former counsel. </p> <p>“In the course of LAIP’s review and after some preliminary investigation, it became apparent to me that numerous items referred to throughout the police reports in Mr Peterson’s case were not included in the discovery that was provided to the defense at the time of trial,” Paula Mitchell, director of the Los Angeles Innocence Project, said in the court filing.</p>",

It’s a vast collection spanning seven decades and a beautiful narrative of Josh’s workflow, creative process and artistry.</p> <p>“Our goal is to increase and prolong Josh’s legacy, whether through a foundation or scholarship in his honour, expanding the product line, increased publicity and continuing to expose his works to gain more recognition for his impact on the art world – and that takes funding.”</p> <p>Whoever takes on the project will need fairly deep pockets. “It would have to be somewhere in seven figures,” says Liano.</p> <p>At the age of 22, Ronald William Kirby was commissioned to paint the portrait of the then mayor of Liverpool, Alderman Joseph Jackson Cleary.</p> <p>It was 1950, and Kirby by then was known as Josh, a nickname given to him during his six years at the Liverpool College of Art by fellow students who compared his work to Sir Joshua Reynolds, the 18th-century portraitist. But Kirby, born in Waterloo, Liverpool, in 1928, would leave both his home city and portrait painting behind as he moved to London to forge a career in book cover art – especially science fiction and fantasy.</p> <p>His first published painting was the cover of a now-forgotten science fiction novel by Dan Morgan, <em>Cee-Tee Man</em>, in 1954. Two years later he was commissioned to create a cover for the Pan paperback edition of Ian Fleming’s James Bond adventure <em>Moonraker</em>. During the 1970s, Kirby’s career flourished and he moved into film poster artwork, including for the <em>Star Wars</em> sequel <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p>    <p>From the mid-1960s until he died in 2001 at the age of 72, Kirby lived and worked in a former rectory in Norfolk, choosing a cramped space as his studio. Liano said: “He painted the majority of the time in a narrow space with a large window letting in north light. This space was literally a pantry off the dining room. There was enough room for his chair, easel, a little radio and one wall lined with many, many piles of sketches and reference material. There may or may not have been a skull residing at the top of one of the piles, which has appeared in more than one of Josh’s horror illustrations.”</p> <p>The estate has had lots of approaches to buy individual pieces from the hundreds of paintings, but it is keen to keep the collection together, perhaps spread out over several galleries, organised by theme.</p>    <p>Liano added: “We have intentionally kept the collection intact and would prefer it stay that way as much as possible because it’s rare to have a collection this large by one artist. It can be separated by genre – horror, sci-fi, Discworld, etc – without dilution and can live in perpetuity that way.”</p> <p>Liano said that the family is looking for a permanent home or homes for the collection – currently most of the paintings are in storage – so that the work can “inspire and impact more artists, and fans of his art can view it in person”. He added: “We are passionate about placing the works in scenarios where their stories can continue to be told within the context of the history of the genres that Josh helped to shape.”</p> <p>Fraser Scott, who runs the London-based A Gallery and also acts as an agent for artists, has been working with the Kirby estate on its search for a patron. He said: “A collection like Josh Kirby’s needs to be public because it such a broadly known part of our culture.</p> <p>“While it may be obvious in 2024 how Kirby’s works for <em>Star Wars</em>, Discworld, <em>Hitchcock Presents</em> or countless other examples are important, hundreds of years into the future that importance is tremendously magnified – when we look back at artefacts from the 1700s, we wish so much more had been preserved for history.</p> <p>“Here’s a chance to ensure one of the great artists of our time [has] his original paintings conserved and available to view for generations to come.”</p> <p>And if a philanthropist is not forthcoming? “We haven’t decided what will happen then,” said Liano. “But we would never sell it off in pieces to the point where the collection is completely diluted. Josh would never want that.”</p>",

The onset of labour coincides, almost to the moment, with a national disaster, the catastrophic breaching of London’s flood defences, which leaves the capital and much of the rest of the country submerged and uninhabitable. As supply chains disintegrate, civilisation starts to collapse into a snarling, semi-feral competition for resources.</p> <p>But what sounds like the setup for a generic, post-apocalyptic survival movie is actually far more intriguing and insightful. The film, adapted by Alice Birch (<em>Lady Macbeth</em>, <em>Normal People</em>) from a novel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/14/the-end-we-start-from-megan-hunter-jodie-comer-film-flooded-london-climate-crisis\">Megan Hunter</a>, uses environmental catastrophe – the moment-to-moment uncertainty, the sense of worlds torn apart – as a metaphor for the crisis mode that kicks in during new motherhood. And it’s not just the mother-child connection that the film captures, but also the intense female friendships that ignite between new mothers. Katherine Waterston bursts into the film like the sun finally breaking through the clouds, shifting the picture’s energy and giving the Woman a confidante and support system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/18/jodie-comer-i-feel-villanelle-would-suit-being-a-scouser\">Jodie Comer: ‘I feel Villanelle would suit being a scouser’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Belo’s intimate, tactile approach works terrifically well: cinematographer Suzie Lavelle draws us into the soft, cocooned space shared by mother and baby, even as violence rages on the edge of the frame. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZyWnu4hJrs\">Anna Meredith’s pulsing score</a> needles like a building panic attack.

            "body" : "<p>The idea that every business needs a messianic mission statement took hold in the 1970s, to “humanise” faceless global corporations. The management guru Peter Drucker was a prime mover of the idea. A good mission statement, Drucker said, should be “short enough to fit on a T-shirt”. Its message should be “broad, even eternal” and “every board member, volunteer, and staff person should be able to see the mission and say, ‘Yes. This is something I want to be remembered for’”.</p> <p>In the years since, the more high-minded that “eternal” statement has been, the more likely it will end up being referenced in criminal courts. Enron, prior to its $65bn bankruptcy and convictions of board members for fraud and insider trading, published its core value as being “To treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves”. The CEO of Lehman Brothers, who received $484m in salary in the seven years prior to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/11/lehman-brothers-collapse-where-are-the-key-figures-now\" title=\"\">biggest collapse in banking history</a>, lived by this pledge: “We are one firm, defined by our unwavering commitment to our clients, our shareholders, and each other.” And Purdue Pharma, under the Sackker family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/17/sackler-family-purdue-pharma-congressional-hearing-apology\">whose OxyContin drug</a> helped to fuel the opioid epidemic, that has killed more than half a million people, swore by this snappy mantra: Evolve to Excellence.</p> <p>Watching the performance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/19/post-office-inquiry-horizon-it-scandal-software-fujitsu\" title=\"\">Fujitsu executives giving evidence</a> to the Horizon inquiry last week, admitting their company’s utterly shameful role in withholding the evidence that would have saved hundreds of innocent subpostmasters from jail and disgrace, it comes as no surprise to learn their corporate vision declares: “Building trust in society through innovation”. Or indeed, despite everything, the Post Office still believes itself to: “Be here, in person, for the people who rely on us”. Rather than waiting for whistleblowers to come forward, investigators of corporate malpractice might keep an eye on company PowerPoints and look out for shouty slogans writ large on office walls. Any combination of the words “integrity”, “trust”, “honesty” or “responsibility” should set alarm bells ringing.</p> <h2>Stop the world</h2>    <p>In his forthcoming book, <em>The Allure of the Multiverse</em><em>,</em> science writer Paul Halpern looks at the history of humans imagining parallel realities. One reading suggests this ancient habit, which finds its contemporary expression in theoretical physics, has risen and fallen in correlation with general satisfaction at this particular cosmos. Some civilisations appear to have less need for alternative universes than others. No doubt, for example, the imminent prospect of another Trump election year will have half the world dreaming of a Sliding Door.</p> <h2>Unhappy feet</h2>    <p>An NHS video instructing people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/18/nhs-demonstrates-how-to-walk-like-a-penguin-in-icy-conditions\" title=\"\">waddle like penguins</a> to avoid slipping on icy pavements provoked outrage from the perpetually spluttering classes. Christopher Snowdon, at the Institute of Economic Affairs, the rightwing thinktank, insisted that “NHS mandarins seem more interested in creating silly slogans and preposterous videos than providing healthcare”. While Maxwell Marlow, at the rival Adam Smith Institute, took the two-minute internet clip as proof that, “as we have long argued, state-run public health is a slippery slope towards worse resource usage”.</p> <p>I couldn’t disagree more. As someone who has so far spent much of 2024 with a bag of frozen peas clamped to my elevated knee, having torn a ligament after sprawling inelegantly on a pile of wet leaves two yards from my front door, my only complaint is this: why didn’t the happy feet demo come a fortnight sooner?</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 January 2024. An earlier version said that the drug OxyContin was responsible for the death of half a million people. In fact this figure relates to the general opioid epidemic, not just to the drug OxyContin.</p> <p>• Tim Adams is an Observer columnist</p>",

For years, she was a fixture of the Nashville music scene, waiting tables and doing odd jobs while playing in various bands, before releasing her debut album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/17/margo-price-midwest-farmers-daughter-review-hands-of-time\">Midwest Farmer’s Daughter</a></em>, in 2016.

Martin Scorsese’s film was brilliant. It’s about the Osage nation, a tribe of Native Americans living in 1920s Oklahoma who became the wealthiest people in the US, which attracted some pretty evil people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/07/leonardo-dicaprio-lily-gladstone-interview-mark-kermode-killers-flower-moon\">Lily Gladstone</a> plays the lead and her performance was breathtaking. Fun fact: they asked me to audition for the role of Robert De Niro’s wife. I didn’t get it, obviously, but it was fun to be included.</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Hobby</strong></h2> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>dulcimer</strong></p>    <p>I started playing the dulcimer about a year ago and it’s been so fun. I started finding information online, figuring out chords, and I had one lesson, then I had the audacity to take this thing on tour with me and play it in front of people. It only has three strings and is actually quite easy to pick a melody out on. I see why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonimitchell\">Joni Mitchell</a> would travel with one: it’s small and lightweight, easier than lugging a guitar through an airport. I hope it inspires people over 40 to pick up a new instrument.</p>    <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Podcast</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast\">Ten Percent Happier</a></strong></p> <p>The host, Dan Harris, was a news anchor but got out of the media after having a panic attack and struggling with substances. He describes himself as a “fidgety sceptic” but it’s a Buddhist-leaning podcast: he interviews the Dalai Lama, monks, nuns and guests such as <a href=\"https://www.estherperel.com/\">Esther Perel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lasarmiento.com/\">La Sarmiento</a>. He speaks to people who have been through some pretty terrible things and lived to tell about it, which gives me perspective. He seems like an honest person and has a dark, dry sense of humour.</p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>Memoir</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dont-tell-anybody-the-secrets-i-told-you-9780593136492\">Don’t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You by Lucinda Williams</a></strong></p>    <p>I’m a disciple of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/01/lucinda-williams-reader-interviewer\">Lucinda Williams</a>. For me, she’s one of the greatest songwriters of our time. I listened to the audiobook because I love Lucinda’s voice – I could hear her talk all day. I loved how upfront she was about her childhood, not having her mom in her life. It was an inspiring story because she did not reach the peak of her fame until she was 51. As women, we have this preconceived notion that it’s all downhill after 30, so this made me have some wind in my sails and think that maybe I’m just getting started.</p> <h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>Restaurant</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.barcontinentalhifi.com/\">Bar Continental, Nashville</a></strong></p>    <p>I enjoy spending time at this restaurant, bar and vinyl listening room. My friend Sean Brock, who is a phenomenal chef and was a friend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/anthony-bourdain-obituary\">Anthony Bourdain</a>’s, has really changed the restaurant game in this town. They have a great menu – they do a prime rib that they cut at the table – and wonderful mocktails. There is also an incredible sound system: recently they did a Willie Nelson night and a Dolly Parton dance party. They have these old speakers that were used to mix <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Highwaymen_(country_supergroup)\"> the Highwaymen</a>’s last album – it’s a really cool little piece of Nashville history.</p> <h2><strong>6. </strong><strong>App</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://insighttimer.com/en-gb\">Insight Timer</a></strong></p>    <p>I was having a really hard time sleeping: my body can be tired but it can be difficult for me to find stillness at the end of the night, so about six months ago I started using this app for sleep meditations. I just put in headphones and listen to a 10 to 20-minute meditation and it helps shut my mind down. It has definitely improved my sleep. I also enjoy the self-compassion meditations because I am my own worst critic. They keep me down to earth and off my phone, doom-scrolling at night.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In recent years, Britain has been busy setting up the scaffolding of the country’s future low-carbon economy. But beyond the Westminster pledges and white papers lies a very practical challenge: where are the workers who will bring the government’s green agenda to life?</p> <p>Britain’s greatest industrial transformation since the Industrial Revolution will require a change on a similar scale: hundreds of thousands of jobs are expected to be created by the needs of a low-carbon economy. There are thousands of miles of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/25/race-to-get-uk-electricity-grid-ready-for-net-zero\" title=\"\">cables to add to the national grid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/20/britishvolt-britains-battery-startup-uk-car-production\" title=\"\">electric car battery factories</a> to build, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2023/dec/23/heat-pumps-science-visualised\" title=\"\">heat pumps</a> to install, and rising demand for wind and solar farms. Experts warn of a “critical shortage” of certified welders and electrical engineers, and fear that the government may have left it too late.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, says Britain is facing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild the economy. But the prime minister is “asleep at the wheel”, he says, while the Tories are “happy to let jobs and wealth that could rebuild Britain go overseas instead”.</p> <p>“Britain’s joiners, welders, engineers, technicians and construction workers are the people who are going to deliver a green future for this country,” Miliband says. “Yet under the Conservatives, far too many good jobs have gone overseas, as other countries get ahead in sectors like steel, electric car production, and clean energy.”</p>    <p>Analysts at the IPPR, a left-leaning thinktank, believe that as many as 1.6m new jobs could be created in the transition to a green economy. The looming skills gap is both a threat to the UK’s net zero ambitions and a big economic opportunity, according to Luke Murphy, an associate director at the IPPR.</p> <p>“We’ve done exceptionally well on the rollout of offshore wind, for example,” he says. “But we’ve failed to capture the economic opportunity the way other countries have.”</p> <p>The IPPR has found that the UK employs fewer people in renewable energy as a proportion of its working-age population than most other European countries. In wind, if the UK was performing as well as Denmark – home to offshore giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/12/hornsey-four-offshore-windfarm-given-green-light-after-five-month-delay\" title=\"\">Ørsted</a> – it could secure an additional 98,000 jobs, it believes. “Unless we have the industrial strategy and necessary skills in place to take advantage of the green transition, we risk missing our net zero targets, and failing to take advantage of the opportunity that lies ahead of us,” Murphy says. “The task ahead requires not only a net zero strategy but an industrial strategy alongside it.”</p> <p>Forecasts for the number of jobs required to realise Britain’s low-carbon ambitions vary. The government’s official climate advisers at the Committee on Climate Change have estimated that between 135,000 and 725,000 net new jobs could be created by 2030 in low-carbon sectors such as generating renewable energy, upgrading buildings and manufacturing electric vehicles.</p> <p>Welders and electrical engineers are in critically short supply, according to Phil Beach, the chief executive of Energy and Utility Skills, a trade association. He estimates that there are only “several hundred” certified welders currently in the UK but the country will need “several thousands” to get to net zero. There are similar concerns for the number of certified electrical engineers, who will be needed across the energy system.</p> <p>“We need to train as many electricians as we can,” Beach says. “This decade we’re expected to lose 20% through retirements – so we’re already looking to find 275,000 roles to be filled this decade. “It can take two to three years to become fully qualified, so we’re facing a critical shortage.”</p> <p>Ministers hope to increase Britain’s offshore wind capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2030, up from just over 10GW at present, and solar capacity fivefold by 2035. They also hope to build 24GW of nuclear power capacity by 2050, from just under 7GW at present. As a result, more than 600,000km of electric lines will need to be added or upgraded across the UK to connect these projects to the grid.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, in homes across the country, up to 600,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/23/heat-pumps-are-hot-property-in-europe-does-britain-have-cold-feet\" title=\"\">heat pumps</a> could replace gas boilers every year under government targets, and electric vehicle charging points are expected to appear along residential streets and motorways.</p> <p>Each element of this plan requires thousands of skilled workers. There is a “massive shortage” of qualified heat pump engineers, according to Nesta, an innovation charity. The current number of accredited heat pump engineers is estimated to be about 3,000 but Britain will need at least 27,000 by 2028 to meet the government’s target.</p> <p>At the same time, the number of people employed by the offshore wind industry will need to triple to just over 104,000 by 2030 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/06/powering-all-uk-homes-via-offshore-wind-by-2030-would-cost-50bn\" title=\"\">to meet current targets</a>, according to the Offshore Wind Industry Council. The Nuclear Industry Association has estimated power stations will require about 250,000 people, compared with their 77,000-strong workforce today.</p> <p>“The truth is, we’re likely to run out of people before we run out of money for the green transition,” says Andy Lane, who leads BP’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/27/bp-leads-energy-companies-preparing-two-major-uk-carbon-capture-projects\" title=\"\">carbon capture business in the UK</a>. The oil company’s planned carbon capture project in Teesside is expected to create about 5,500 jobs and the company is working with local colleges to help offer apprenticeships in a bid to develop a pipeline of engineering talent and green skills.</p> <p>The task of securing skilled workers had been largely regional in focus, according to Lane, who has also contributed to the government’s green jobs taskforce to help map out where skills are needed across the country.</p> <p>“It’s important to remember that this is an opportunity. These are good, secure jobs that have value and a purpose. We need to communicate the positive case for these jobs and inspire a more diverse workforce,” says Lane. “Historically, this industry has been filled with white males – and that won’t work in the future.”</p> <p>Labour has put forward a plan to make Britain a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/labour-unveils-plans-for-carbon-neutral-energy-system-by-2030s\" title=\"\">green energy superpower</a>” with a focus on delivering at least 500,000 skilled jobs across every region of the country. The plan includes a fund of £500m to provide capital grants to clean energy projects that win a government support contract and can prove that they will invest in building supply chains and jobs in Britain’s industrial heartlands.</p> <p>The partyLabour’s green prosperity plan, says Miliband, will “rebuild this country with proper jobs and apprenticeships that are well paid, secure, and bring prosperity to families and communities”.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said it had created 80,000 green jobs in the UK since 2020. “Our plan will attract £100bn of investment in green industries of the future and support 480,000 jobs by 2030.

            "body" : "<p>​This had always looked an appetising assignment for Arsenal to use as a reset and, sure enough, Crystal Palace were the most obliging of visitors. Nothing should be taken away from Mikel Arteta’s side, who reminded their title rivals that they are far from a lost cause and showed the benefits of a warm-weather training break in Dubai. They were nowhere near full tilt in easing clear by five goals and it pleased their manager hugely that Gabriel Martinelli, largely blunt this season, came on to crown their afternoon with two identical finishes in added time.</p> \n<p>Shortly after that, the uncertainties that have set in at Palace were laid bare. Upon the full-time whistle Roy Hodgson stared impassively towards an away section that held up banners reading “Wasted potential on and off the pitch, weak decisions taking us backwards” and “No shared vision, no structured plan, [Steve] Parish out, Yanks out”. His players had been present in body only, offering scant resistance in those moments when Arsenal turned up the heat, and a run of one win in 12 games across all competitions bodes ominously.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/jan/20/arsenal-v-crystal-palace-premier-league-live\">Arsenal v Crystal Palace: Premier League – live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So, perhaps, did the presence of Graham Potter in the Emirates stands. Should Palace’s owners, who came under far heavier fire than Hodgson, opt to make a change the former Chelsea and Brighton manager is probably the best out-of-work alternative. But there would be no quick fix in revitalising a group, albeit depleted by the absences of Jordan Ayew and Michael Olise, that look patently low both on morale and the quality required to consistently pick up results.</p> \n<p>When it mattered, Palace lost every battle going. Arteta could rightly be delighted that well-executed set-pieces offered up headers to Gabriel Magalhães for Arsenal’s first two goals, even if the second was attributed to Dean Henderson. On both occasions, though, Gabriel made mincemeat of his marker Chris Richards in textbook exhibitions of superior movement and aggression.</p> \n<p>It meant Arsenal have scored 10 times from corners this season, more than anyone else in the Premier League. Their third goal came from a lightning counter after Palace, who had emerged for the second half with a little more intent, squandered a corner of their own. Leandro Trossard finished the move, scoring in the league for the first time since 11 November; Arteta punched the air and it became an occasion for the recently goal-shy hosts to remember their lines.</p> \n<p>Arsenal had started sharply enough when Declan Rice, who came off in the second half complaining of muscle tightness, floated over a corner that openly invited an aerial battle. In the end it met no such competition: the only player straining every sinew to reach it was Gabriel, who completely outfought Richards and rose high before nodding to Henderson’s left.</p> \n<p>In the period before doubling their lead Arsenal had drifted slightly, David Raya redeeming a poor clearance by saving at full stretch from Jefferson Lerma. But there was never much sense of jeopardy and, after smart interplay between Martin Ødegaard and Bukayo Saka earned the latter an inswinger from the right, Gabriel ran around the back. He lost the hapless Richards again and, via a sizeable diversion off Henderson, found the net from an angle. Palace felt Ben White had blocked Henderson, but VAR had no sympathy.</p> \n<p>From there Arsenal operated in bursts, which was all they needed to do. This became the mixture of control and finishing power Arteta has craved, although they will rarely be asked this few questions. To his credit Eberechi Eze kept trying to probe and, a little before Trossard’s strike, made Raya save smartly from range. The keeper would later bat over an Eze free-kick but that was the sum of Palace’s threat. They departed without creating a single clear chance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Arsenal soaked up the little that came in their direction, and then put Palace away. Raya, who has earned mixed reviews since taking Aaron Ramsdale’s spot, deserved plaudits for catching Will Hughes’s hopeful cross and rapidly sending Gabriel Jesus away with a subsequent throw. Earlier on Jesus had centred for Trossard, only for the Belgian to miscue glaringly. This time the combination yielded far more, Jesus streaking away and setting up his teammate for a finish that, via a shimmy that sent Nathaniel Clyne to the floor, gave Henderson no chance.</p> \n<p>Arteta visibly enjoyed that sequence and, with the points sealed, Arsenal cruised through the latter stages. That was until the substitute Martinelli, always an insistent presence, twice found space in an inside-left channel vacated by opponents who had nothing left. “He wasn’t fully, fully fit,” Arteta said. But both times he opened up his body to shoot with his right foot; both times he scored and Arsenal could reflect on the perfect pick-me-up. Hodgson, in the meantime, could only wonder how he turns Palace’s fortunes around from here.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It seemed astonishing to recall Rory McIlroy began day three of this Dubai Desert Classic 10 shots off the lead. By the time the defending champion was undertaking media duties, he topped the leaderboard. A 63 and some vintage McIlroy means a record-breaking fourth Desert Classic crown is within his grasp.</p> \n<p>By the setting of the desert sun, McIlroy’s position was not as formidable as in the immediate aftermath of his round. Cameron Young, the 36-hole leader, recovered from front-nine wobbles to post a 71 and edge two clear of McIlroy. Can the American, a debutant here, withstand pressure from McIlroy on day four? The pair will play together. Adrian Meronk remains a key part of the conversation, tied with McIlroy at 12 under par after adding a 70 to rounds of 68 and 66.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/19/angel-cabrera-welcome-at-masters-despite-domestic-abuse-prison-sentence-golf\">Ángel Cabrera ‘welcome’ at Masters despite domestic abuse prison term</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet this was undeniably McIlroy’s day.

It’s been a really, really good place to me. I love coming back here.”</p> \n<p>Superb approach play helped him to birdie the 1st, 3rd and four holes in succession from the 7th. Things slowed down somewhat thereafter as he only collected a shot at the par-five 13th. He was to save the best until last. From the fringe behind the 18th green, he curled home a glorious putt for an eagle three. The crowd roar and McIlroy’s celebration dictated how significant that moment may prove. At this venue, McIlroy always feels he has a chance.</p> \n<p>“It’s a combination of the course and the way the course is set up,” he said. “If you play very, very well, it enables you to go low. But if you are just slightly off, you can feel you have played well but shoot the scores I did on the first two days, 71-70. But when you are behind, having a course set up like this where the misses are penal and the greens are firm, it gives guys a chance from the pack to shoot a good score.”</p> \n<p>Nine under par ties McIlroy’s lowest score at this venue. It did not take Young at all by surprise. “You expect him to do that,” he said. “I figured he wasn’t going to be 30th for long.”</p> \n<p>Tommy Fleetwood confirmed he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/19/fleetwood-and-hjgaard-turn-down-liv-offers-with-hatton-in-rebel-tours-sights\" title=\"\">received an approach from LIV</a> after it emerged the European Ryder Cup player had rejected a multimillion pound offer from the Saudi Arabian-backed tour. Fleetwood and fellow Englishman Tyrrell Hatton are among players who have been identified by LIV before its third season.</p> \n<p>“People have been getting approached for a long time,” said Fleetwood. “I don’t think it’s news that people are still getting approached by LIV. Some people will go, some won’t. At some point we will either all play together or we won’t. I will always do what I think is best for my game.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hatton was similar in theme, although his management have insisted there has been no formal offer to the 32-year-old, he remains an LIV target. “I’d say there’s several people have had conversations,” he said. “That’s part and parcel of golf at the moment but I’m quite happy playing PGA Tour and DP World Tour. There’s a lot of people have [had conversations] and I don’t think there is anything to shy away from.”</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether he would be remaining on the traditional tours, Hatton said: “As of right now, yes.” LIV appears to have a window of opportunity.</p>",

While the Portuguese, speaking at an awards event in Dubai, on Friday said the Pro League was better than France’s Ligue 1, his teammate spoke far less favourably.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/19/ive-never-tried-to-hurt-anybody-no-regrets-for-jordan-henderson-on-ajax-arrival\">‘I’ve never tried to hurt anybody’: no regrets for Henderson on Ajax arrival</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Laporte said it has proven difficult to adapt to his new surroundings in an interview with Spanish newspaper AS. “It is a big change compared to Europe, but in the end it is all about adaptation,” said the five-time English Premier League winner. “They have not made it easy for us. In fact, there are many players that are discontented. We are working on it every day, negotiating so to speak, and to see if it improves a little because this is something new for them too, having European players who already have a long career. Maybe they are not used to this and have to adapt to a little more seriousness.</p> \n<p>Laporte acknowledged the financial rewards on offer, and said he had no plans to leave but Henderson’s exit, and talk of dissatisfaction from Roberto Firmino and Karim Benzema, both linked with loan moves back to Europe, has thrown deep doubts in what became a gold rush for players last summer.</p> \n<p><em>“</em>Many of us have also come here not only for football,” said Laporte. “Many of us are happy with that, but I am also looking for something beyond that is not the economic part and such. In terms of quality of life, I expected something different because in the end here you spend three hours a day in the car. Riyadh is a waste of traffic, of time wasted in the car.”</p> \n<p>That contravened the glowing review given to Saudi football from Ronaldo, who on Friday received three Globe Soccer awards in Dubai after scoring 54 goals in 59 games for Al-Nassr. He declared: “To be honest, I think the Saudi league is not worse than the French league, in my opinion. In Saudi, I think it is more competitive. They can say whatever they want; it is just an opinion. I have played here for one year so I know what I am talking about. But, I think right now we are better than the French league.”</p> \n<p>Laporte meanwhile signalled that a lack of professionalism has been problematic. “The ultimatum you can give them doesn’t matter to them. I mean, they’re really going about their business. You negotiate something and then they don’t accept it after you have signed it. They fight you.”</p> \n<p>Friday saw Henderson unveiled by Ajax after his ill-starred spell with Al-Ettifaq. The former Liverpool captain refused to criticise his now-former employers: “I haven’t got a bad word to say about anybody over there in the league, or the club. I’ll have friends over there that I’ll speak to forever.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In the final days before New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary, Nikki Haley is sharpening her attacks on Donald Trump as the former South Carolina governor courts the state’s famously discerning independent voters.</p> <p>After coming in third in the Iowa caucuses, Haley’s is casting her candidacy as a “better choice” for a nation barreling towards a possible rematch between Trump, 77 and Joe Biden, 81.</p> <p>“Do we really want to have two 80-year-olds running for president, when we’ve got a country in disarray and a world on fire?” Haley, who turns 52 on Saturday, is filmed asking during a CNN town Hall in Henniker, New Hampshire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/17/trump-new-hampshire-poll-lead\">Major poll gives Trump 16-point lead in New Hampshire days before primary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the campaign trail and on social media, she has taunted Trump for refusing to debate her. This week, Haley announced she would only participate in Republican debates if Trump did. He refused, forcing CNN and ABC News to cancel two scheduled Republican debates.</p> <p>At an event in Rochester, she accused Trump of throwing a “temper tantrum” after he berated her performance as his UN ambassador. It was Trump, she told voters in the town of Hollis, who “lost” Republicans control of Congress and the White House.</p> <p>It’s a notable shift in rhetoric for a candidate who, until recently, had attempted to establish herself as the only viable alternative to Trump without taking him on directly. After months of implicit calls for “generational change” and competency tests for older politicians, she is now openly seeking confrontation with her former boss.</p> <p>Trump hardly needed to be goaded into a response. At rallies and on social media, he has unleashed a torrent of attacks on Haley, even as he predicted an easy victory in New Hampshire and declared the race effectively over.</p> <p>At a rally in Concord on Friday night, Trump said Haley was “not presidential timber” and essentially ruled her out of contention as his running mate. (Earlier on Friday, an anti-Trump Haley supporter said she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSEveningNews/status/1748495291349688435\">assured</a> him that being Trump’s vice-president was “off the table”.)</p> <p>Haley has brushed aside some of Trump’s ugliest conspiratorial and race-based attacks as a sign that he was “insecure”. In a revival of the birtherism claims, he falsely suggested on social media that Haley, the South Carolina-born daughter of Indian immigrants, was ineligible for the presidency. She is not. And though she has always gone by her middle name, Nikki, Trump referred to her in a series of social media posts by her given name, Nimarata, misspelling it as “Nimrada” and “Nimbra”.</p> <p>“I know President Trump well. That’s what he does when he feels threatened,” she said. “I don’t take these things personally.”</p> <p>But even as Haley ramps up her criticism of Trump, she is treading carefully. “People either want me to hate Trump or love Trump,” Haley told voters on Thursday, explaining that she would refrain from personal attacks.</p> <p>The approach has frustrated never-Trump voters in the state who are searching for a Republican who will challenge him on matters of principle, not just policy.</p> <p>“She’s just not willing to take him on,” said Fergus Cullen, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican party and prominent Trump opponent.</p> <p>Cullen has seen Haley campaign four times in New Hampshire and said he was left “frustrated and disappointed” by her reluctance to go after Trump more aggressively, which he thinks will cost her support among independents.</p>    <p>​But Haley’s allies say there are risks to a more aggressive approach. If there was an appetite among the Republican electorate for a fiercely anti-Trump candidate, they contend, the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/10/republican-chris-christie-suspends-presidential-bid\">would still be in the race</a>.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Haley has declined to comment on Trump’s fitness for office and has repeatedly sidestepped questions related to the pending criminal cases against him. </p> <p>At the CNN town hall, Haley said she would not pre-emptively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/19/nikki-haley-trump-pardon-new-hampshire-townhall#:~:text=Haley%20said%20she%20would%20not%2C%20but%20she%20said%20she%20would,whether%20he's%20innocent%20or%20guilty.\">pardon Trump but would do so if he were convicted</a> of any of the 91 felony counts against him. “The last thing we need is an 80-year-old president sitting in jail, because that’s just going to further divide our country,” she said.</p> <p>After winning every single county in Iowa save for one – the state’s most liberal, <a href=\"https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/nikki-haley-wins-johnson-county-by-a-single-vote-only-county-in-state-trump-doesnt-win\">which broke for Haley by one vote</a> – Trump is seen as potentially more vulnerable in New Hampshire. Granite state voters tend to be better educated, less religious and more independent than Iowa caucus-goers, a departure from Trump’s core base in Iowa.</p> <p>In the latest <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/17/metro/new-hampshire-republican-primary-tracking-poll-results/?event=event12\">Boston Globe/Suffolk University/NBC-10 Boston</a> tracking poll, Trump earned support from 53% of likely New Hampshire Republican primary voters, followed by Haley with 36%. </p> <p>Haley said on Thursday that her goal in New Hampshire was to “do better than we did in Iowa”.</p> <p>The odds that she can improve on a third place finish in Iowa are high: the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, is effectively looking past the New Hampshire primary, where he is polling in the low-single digits, to next month’s contest in South Carolina, Haley’s home state.</p> <p>With DeSantis weakened, Trump has turned his ire on Haley as he seeks to blunt her already narrow path to the nomination with a decisive victory in New Hampshire. In speeches and ads, he is assailing her record as governor and as his ambassador, while accusing her of relying on “Democrats and liberals” to win the state.</p> <p>The broadsides have forced Haley to defend her conservative record as a “Tea Party governor” and as his hawkish UN ambassador. “I’m going to be hard on China, and he wasn’t hard on China,” Haley said Friday, urging voters and the press to “stop taking what he’s saying to be golden.”</p> <p>Haley hopes a strong showing in New Hampshire will vault her into South Carolina. In a sign that Trump is consolidating support, South Carolina senator Tim Scott, who Haley appointed to the seat in 2012, endorsed the former president on Friday. Scott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/13/tim-scott-suspends-presidential-bid\">suspended his presidential bid </a>last year after failing to break through in the polls.</p> <p>“Interesting that Trump’s lining up with all the Washington insiders when he claimed he wanted to drain the swamp,” Haley said in a statement. “But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do.”</p> <p>Chris Sununu, the popular Republican governor of New Hampshire who has been sheparding Haley around the state during the weeklong sprint between the caucuses and the primary, said she had “already exceeded expectations” by forcing Trump into a two-person race.</p> <p>“Voter turnout was very, very low in Iowa,” he said at a campaign event in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire on Tuesday night. “But here in New Hampshire we understand what this is all about, and we understand the rest of the country is watching and praying that we get this one right.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A 92-year-old retired Catholic priest jailed in New Orleans since September on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/08/new-orleans-priest-lawrence-hecker-indictment-accuser\">charges</a> of child rape and kidnapping has been hospitalized, his attorneys said on Friday.</p> <p>Lawrence Hecker – who admitted that he sexually molested or harassed underage boys in the 1960s and 1970s during a remarkable interview with <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/investigations/david-hammer/lawrence-hecker-priest-retired-child-pornography-sex-abuse-catholic-religion/289-099a2d6d-a2ae-4b90-ab9e-19f02be97a05\">WWL Louisiana</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/23/new-orleans-priest-admits-abusing-minors\">the Guardian</a> in August – has experienced mental decline, disorientation and some physical ailments while being held in New Orleans’s jail, attorneys argued during a state court hearing.</p> <p>They requested home confinement for Hecker should he be released from the hospital, but the judge presiding over his case, Ben Willard, said: “That’s not going to happen.”</p> <p>The New Orleans state prosecutor Ned McGowan suggested a secure hospital that can provide mental health treatment in East Feliciana parish, Louisiana, about 120 miles to the north-west. But McGowan opposed Hecker’s release to home confinement, saying the retired priest had admitted under oath to viewing child sexual abuse images.</p> <p>McGowan’s remarks appeared to be a reference to a December 2020 deposition given by Hecker in a separate civil lawsuit accusing him of child rape. As the Guardian had previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/new-orleans-catholic-church-priests-sexual-abuse-protect-children\">reported</a>, Hecker said in that deposition that he would look at such images if they “appeared on his computer” while cruising for pornography.</p> <p>Hecker has been in jail since he was arrested on 8 September on grand jury charges that he choked a high school student and sodomized him while he was unconscious. That was decades after Hecker provided an administrative statement to New Orleans Catholic church leaders in which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/new-orleans-priest-lawrence-hecker-child-abuse\">acknowledged</a> that he had sexually molested or harassed numerous children whom he had met after becoming an ordained priest in 1958.</p> <p>Hecker’s clerical career continued until the archdiocese of New Orleans allowed him to retire with full benefits in 2002, during an earlier high point in the worldwide Catholic church’s continuing clerical abuse crisis. The church waited another 16 years before publicly identifying him as a credibly accused child molester.</p> <p>Less than a month before his indictment, Hecker discussed that statement with WWL Louisiana and the Guardian. Hecker was lucid and stood the whole time during the interview, an 18-minute session during which he said “yes” multiple times when asked whether the statement he had given to his superiors was accurate.</p> <p>Hecker claimed that society had been more permissive of such behavior in the 1960s and 70s, though it was as illegal to engage in sexual activity with minors then as it is now.</p> <p>Willard has tentatively set Hecker’s trial date for 25 March. He would face a sentence of mandatory life imprisonment if he is convicted as charged.</p> <p>Hecker has pleaded not guilty. He has been in the custody of authorities since his arrest because he has not been able to pay the $800,000 bail set for him by Willard.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ramon-antonio-vargas\">Ramon Antonio Vargas</a> contributed to this report</em></p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>It may be unwise to prematurely wonder about the fate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead\">Radiohead</a>, still one of the most important bands in the world. But confronted by this assured, slinky and tuneful follow-up to 2022’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/15/the-smile-a-light-for-attracting-attention-review-almost-as-good-as-a-new-radiohead-album\">A Light </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/15/the-smile-a-light-for-attracting-attention-review-almost-as-good-as-a-new-radiohead-album\">for Attracting Attention</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.thesmiletheband.com/music\">the Smile</a> are categorically where Thom Yorke and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/09/radiohead-jonny-greenwood-cocaine-hook-me-up-recorder-group-classical-label\">Jonny Greenwood</a> are expending their A-game energies right now – this pared-down, agile iteration of Yorke’s and Greenwood’s sound, abetted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sons-of-kemet\">Sons of Kemet</a> drummer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/08/tom-skinner-on-the-smile-sons-of-kemet-and-going-solo-it-gives-me-a-blank-slate-to-explore\">Tom Skinner</a>.</p> <p>To <em>A Light…’s</em> funkiness and rage, <em>Wall of Eyes</em> adds psychedelia, 70s German motorik and the strings of the London Contemporary Orchestra. It’s a more considered, unspooling record, but maintains the Smile’s high bar. The <a href=\"https://thesmiletheband.com/live\">band’s touring schedule</a> has allowed this fresh Smile album to grow quite organically out of its predecessor. A number of songs destined for <em>Wall of Eyes</em> have been debuted live and worked into set lists over the past couple of years. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBtJ9_zTqdE\">Bending Hectic</a>, <em>Wall of Eyes’s</em> nail-biting car-accident set piece, came out a year ago, ostensibly as a standalone. (A<a href=\"https://thesmile.bandcamp.com/album/the-smile-live-at-montreux-jazz-festival-july-2022\"> live album recorded at Montreux jazz festival</a> was released in December 2022 followed by a 2023 limited-edition vinyl EP, <em>Europe: Live Recordings</em>.)</p> <p>Standout track Friend of a Friend began life live in 2022 as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSmile/comments/v20acl/people_on_balconies_the_smile_may_30th_roundhouse/\">People on Balconies</a>. The lyrics describe neighbours socialising alfresco in Italy, a common practice during Covid-19 lockdowns (Yorke’s partner, <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/radioheads-thom-yorke-marries-partner-dajana-roncione-in-sicily-2759784\">Dajana Roncione</a>, is Italian). Events turn sour (“we take a tumble”) and suspicious (“All of that money/ Where did it go?”). Built from piano and increasingly alarmed strings, Friend of a Friend finds the Smile – notionally a jazz-augmented detour from Radiohead – also taking an unexpectedly orthodox, Beatle-y turn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels like Yorke and Greenwood become liberated to sidestep the expectations that must come when booting up the mothership</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other tracks, such as Under Our Pillows – built around a penetrating Greenwood guitar figure – have been available via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9erwtd1kakQ\">YouTube fan footage</a>. The brooding, wistful, flute-enhanced Teleharmonic made an appearance in an earlier life on <em>Peaky Blinders</em> (under a slightly different name). Different artists take a wide variety of paths in presenting their work nowadays, from dropping unheard new tracks all at once to long, drawn-out reveals across social media. The fact that there are live fan favourites out there that have not yet made it to recorded versions makes the Smile feel less like a side project and increasingly like a going concern who are workshopping a significant body of work in real time.</p> <p>There have, of course, been umpteen Radiohead offshoots before – Atoms for Peace, solo Yorke albums, most often electronic, Greenwood’s scores for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/01/paul-thomas-anderson-you-can-tell-a-lot-about-a-person-by-what-they-order-for-breakfast\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> films, a solo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/09/radioheads-ed-obrien-humanity-has-only-really-learned-from-disaster\">Ed O’Brien </a>outing. But the Smile now feel like a living, breathing organism as dynamic and real as Yorke and Greenwood’s day job. The pair naturally provide continuity between projects; <em><a href=\"https://www.mtv.com/news/pu5hsd/radiohead-put-wall-of-ice-ep-rumors-to-rest-for-now\">Wall of Ice</a></em><a href=\"https://www.mtv.com/news/pu5hsd/radiohead-put-wall-of-ice-ep-rumors-to-rest-for-now\"> </a>was once rumoured to be a mooted Radiohead EP title. As with Damon Albarn’s many outlets, their core set of concerns and signature melodic voices often remain consistent across configurations.</p> <p>It’s worth pointing up the differences that remain, of course. A crucial one is Skinner, who has also drummed for Floating Points and Kano. He is a decade younger than O’Brien and Yorke, and his role, in theory, has been to add even more complex rhythms to Yorke and Greenwood’s often knotty cat’s cradles of music. But he is also a skilled multi-instrumentalist with an entirely fresh set of inputs, whose keyboard credits confirm an increasingly expanded brief.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx75oOxpQaY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yx75oOxpQaY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx75oOxpQaY\">Watch the video for Friend of a Friend by the Smile.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Another is more of a vibe. In the Smile, it feels like Yorke and Greenwood become liberated to sidestep the expectations, admin and headaches that must come when booting up the mothership. You can see the appeal: three musicians, sometimes augmented by saxophonist Robert Stillman; they can move more nimbly and create modern classical/funk hybrid jams to their hearts’ contents.</p> <p>Yorke could be fulminating against any number of things on Read the Room, a superb three-legged processional that turns into a motorik prowl halfway through. But the more skittish among Radiohead fans, already a group self-selecting for twitchiness, could easily project a great deal on to these lyrics. “And when the time is right,” sings Yorke, “And when the end has come/ Maybe you can’t, maybe you can’t/ Be arsed for half a million.”</p> <p>What <em>Wall of Eyes</em> lacks is the shock of the new. It’s a second album, and much of it is loose online, with two novelties. You Know Me! ends the set with what sounds like a gentle love song turned on its head, Yorke’s falsetto pondering those – maybe album reviewers – who think they know him, but don’t.</p> <p>The subtle, unfurling I Quit, meanwhile, marries guitar, piano and percussion to create an arpeggiating Doppler effect strafed by electronics. “This is my stop, this is the end of the trip,” sings Yorke. In the same breath he’s ruminating on “conscience” and “brotherhood” and “a new path out of the madness, to wherever it goes”. That path may well be shaped like a smile.</p>",

The number of people going on holiday by themselves has risen from 6% in 2011 to 16% in 2023 according to the Association of British Travel Agents, which said people had a “strong appetite to go it alone”. Some operators have seen big increases – solo bookings accounted for 46% of Tourhub’s business last year.</p> <p>Solo doesn’t always mean alone though. Lots of solo travellers join group tours, as Jen Burton did last year. “I didn’t know anyone at all and turned up at the airport completely terrified,” said Burton, 40, who opened the Bea and Aud Lifestyle clothes shop in Buckingham last year. “Now I’ve made friends for life.”</p>    <p>She had recently split from her husband of 19 years, and had decided to join an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/carbon-offsets-are-not-credible-the-travel-boss-exposing-the-truth-about-the-industrys-sustainability\" title=\"\">Intrepid Travel</a> trip to Jordan for 16 women organised by Claire and Laura Jopson, who run the travel blog <em>Twin Perspectives</em>.</p> <p>“I walked up to some of the ladies in the check-in queue and straight away they kind of knew that I’d been having a really tough time,” she said. “The support you can get from a group of women you don’t even know is phenomenal.”</p> <p>Burton, who was the oldest, added: “[I had] never laughed so hard in my whole life. But then in the next instance we’d have these amazing feminist chats.”</p> <p>Since the Jordan trip, many of the women have stayed in touch and last week Burton was hosting an Australian friend she met while travelling. Norway is next. “This time I’ll share a room,” she said. “I felt like I was slightly missing out in my own room.”</p> <p>Companies such as Just You and Flash Pack cater specifically for solo travellers, while others, including Newmarket Holidays, Riviera Travel and Jules Verne, offer solo-only or solo-friendly trips.</p> <p>“Sixty per cent of our travellers are solo,” said Yves Marceau, vice president for products at G Adventures. He said the company went to great efforts to design tours that fostered friendships, making sure there was enough time for people to meet each other and mingle. Tour guides were trained to create a sense of camaraderie and to spot when people might not be getting on.</p> <p>“A young man in his early 20s wrote to us about his trip,” Marceau said. “He was sharing a room with a guy who was 75. He said ‘my initial reaction was, Oh, my God, this is going to be a dreadful experience. But over the course of the first few days, I became so connected with this gentleman that we are still friends.’ Those [stories] are the reason we do this.”</p> <p>G Adventures and some other firms, such as Hostelworld, have created their own apps with social elements, but smaller companies use other social media. Chris Bone, the founder of Adventure Solos, invites every tour member to a WhatsApp group when they book.</p> <p>“It really breaks the ice,” Bone said. He runs adventure weekends and week-long expeditions around the UK, with activities including hiking, canoeing and climbing. “Often people might be travelling a long way, and they’ll car share or get the same train. And often people have been to events before.”</p>    <p>It means that an hour into a hike, Bone’s guests are very relaxed. “What’s really nice is that all this stuff comes flooding out. People have often been through a recent life change. But no one knows anyone else and [there are] no preconceived ideas.”</p> <p>Not that every group creates friendships. “There were a couple of guys who were persistently late every day,” said Carole Railton, a body language expert and author, of a trip to Morocco. “We had buses picking us up or trains to catch, and they would amble down. People were grumpy because they were taking time out of everyone’s holiday.”</p> <p>Joyce Connor, a makeup artist, was one of only two solo travellers on a trip to Vietnam, and the other woman was much older. “I’m 60,” she said. “I basically ended up being her carer for two weeks. It wasn’t fun. She didn’t know how to use her phone or check in for her flight. And she didn’t want to eat alone, but she only wanted to go to places that had English food. In Vietnam.</p> <p>“But on another trip I met a woman on day two and it turned out we have a mutual friend. Now the three of us go out together.”</p>    <p>There are still plenty of solo travellers who avoid groups, and life has become easier for them. People used to look down on solo travellers, according to Georgie Darling, a freelance travel writer. “It was something people thought you did out of desperation. Now it’s become more of a ‘cool concept’.” Travel influencers on TikTok and Instagram, such as Janet Newenham, have shown that solo travel can be admirable, Darling said.</p> <p>She stays in co-living spaces – hostels with private rooms and workplaces. “I look for expat groups in the city or town I’m at. So I’m in Mexico now, and this morning I’m going to a brunch for female entrepreneurs. Everyone is here with the intention of meeting new people – last night there was a taco bar crawl.</p> <p>“I’ve just joined a WhatsApp group for women in London who are solo travelling. And already there’s been about 15 different trips arranged, with people saying ‘I’m going to be in Copenhagen this weekend’. These things are easy to find now.”</p>",

I don’t know if you’ve heard, but planes are currently disintegrating in mid-air because of <em>diversity. </em>That’s right, thanks to wokeness gone mad, women and minorities are being ushered into the highest levels of the aviation industry without a single qualification to their name. Nobody cares if you can fly or not, the only qualification for being a pilot these days is a vagina and some melanin.</p> <p>Obviously, this is all nonsense that only a bigoted fool would believe. Alas, the US is awash with bigoted fools (indeed, many of them are politicians) and the idea that diversity, equity and inclusion efforts (DEI) are putting airplane passengers in danger is the latest deranged talking point from the right. You know, the same crowd that brought us such classics as “all gays are <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/new-report-anti-lgbtq-grooming-narrative-surged-more-than-400-on-social-media-following-floridas-dont-say-gay-or-trans-law-as-social-platforms-enabled-extremist-politicians-and-their-allies-to-peddle-inflamatory-discriminatory-rhetoric\">groomers</a>” and “Bill Gates has put mind-controlling microchips in vaccines!”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/19/missouri-anti-trans-legislation-this-year\">Missouri is ground zero for the firehose of anti-trans legislation | Erin Reed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conservatives have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/02/ron-desantis-block-dei-program-state-colleges-florida\">obsessed</a> with disparaging DEI initiatives for a while now, but they only started explicitly connecting DEI with aviation safety earlier this year, after a terrifying mid-air cabin panel blowout on a brand new Boeing 737 Max 9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/06/alaska-airlines-grounds-boeing-737-max-9-planes-after-mid-air-window-blowout\">operated by Alaska Airlines</a>.</p> <p>The Alaska Airlines incident, I’m sure you know, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boeing-alaska-airlines-emergency-door-plug-1ef6d34c42fb22935c03a9cea46dd814\">was not exactly the first</a> time a Boeing 737 Max has had issues. Indeed, there have been so many fatal crashes and troubling safety incidents that someone even <a href=\"https://www.ismyplanea737max.com/\">set up a website</a> that lets you check if you’re travelling on a 737.</p> <p>Beyond Boeing, there have also been a spate of high-profile air travel problems recently. Earlier this month, for example, domestic flights across the US were temporarily grounded after a failure in a critical aviation safety system. And, last year, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/21/business/airline-safety-close-calls.html\">a New York Times analysis</a> found that “close calls involving commercial airlines have been happening, on average, multiple times a week”. Speaking to a Senate panel about the issue, Senator Tammy Duckworth <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/11/09/near-miss-airport-airplanes/\">proclaimed</a>: “Our nation is experiencing an aviation safety crisis with near misses that are happening way too frequently.”</p> <p>Rightwing geniuses have been following this worrying trend carefully and have come to the astute conclusion that women and Black people are to blame.</p> <p>“DEI is destroying the airline industry, and lots of people will die because of it,” the rightwing blogger Matt Walsh <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1745211799635398896?s=20&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">told his 2.6 million Twitter followers</a> shortly after the Alaska Airlines incident. The rightwing commentator Ian Miles Cheong similarly <a href=\"https://x.com/stillgray/status/1743739535178235914?s=20\">tweeted</a>: “The 737 MAX was put together by a team of ‘diverse’ engineers. Boeing is hiring based on DEI. No surprise that they’re falling apart.”</p> <p>Whenever there’s a stupid and bigoted theory floating around the internet you can bet that Elon Musk is close behind, eagerly endorsing it. This is no exception. “Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety? That is actually happening,” the billionaire recently said, <a href=\"https://x.com/ConceptualJames/status/1745110176372339167?s=20\">quote-tweeting someone</a> who noted that executives at Boeing were being rewarded if they hit DEI targets.</p> <p>This wasn’t all Musk had to say on the issue. The X CEO <a href=\"https://hbcuconnect.com/content/392658/elon-musk-cosigns-racist-claim-that-hbcu-students-have-low-iqs-and-should-not-be-pipelined-into-diversity-pilot-program\">also replied</a> to a tweet that suggested students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have lower IQs and therefore shouldn’t become pilots. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1744821656990675184?s=20\">Musk’s reply</a>? “It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE.” It’s hard to overstate just how racist this is.</p> <p>Where Musk goes, his crowds of adoring fans follow. The “DEI is making airplane travel unsafe” theory has gone from a fringe view to a staple of the rightwing news. Outlets like the New York Post have been churning out pieces on the issue: “America’s safety at risk as FAA’s latest diversity push puts the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/01/16/opinion/faa-diversity-push-puts-woke-ideas-ahead-of-americas-safety/\">woke mob at the controls</a>,” squealed one headline. “FAA’s diversity push includes focus on hiring people with ‘severe intellectual’ and ‘psychiatric’ disabilities,” <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/01/14/news/faas-diversity-push-includes-hiring-people-with-intellectual-and-psychiatric-disabilities/\">screeched another</a>.</p> <p>Amid all this bigotry there is one tiny grain of truth: there is a problem with safety in the airline industry. But, like most things that women and minorities get blamed for, this problem is caused by unfettered capitalism. There is a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/19/1225466035/boeing-737-max-faa-door-plug-alaska-crashes-ntsb?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;fbclid=IwAR1kX2PQ12zrXuNKm0sVS1uQxvusGRiDFQ4EuBcX_2oI7SOJzWx-bO_74ik\">great deal of “coziness”</a> between Boeing and the US government: their special relationship has long raised questions about just how much influence the company has in Washington and whether Boeing is allowed to regulate itself too much. Like many companies, Boeing seems to be more obsessed with delivering returns to shareholders than anything else and has frequently been criticized for <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-fifth-estate-costs-safety-1.5426571\">putting cost cutting over safety</a>.

I can’t believe I wasted so much of my life not having a dog.</p> <p><strong>My dad was an engineer </strong>and my mum was a botanist and biochemist. I wasn’t academic. When my maths teacher asked us to put triangles and squares into sets, I thought, why do they have to be in sets? Why can’t they just be them?</p> <p><strong>My first play</strong> at school<strong> </strong>was<em> Ernie’s Incredible Hallucinations</em>. I had a small part as a librarian. When I said one of my lines everyone laughed. I thought, I could do with more of this. I’ve been chasing approval ever since.</p> <p><strong>As scientists, </strong>my parents didn’t necessarily know that studying arts is clever. But once I got a place at drama school they were incredibly supportive and focused. The day before I had to audition for a grant, they practised the drive to make sure I got there on time.</p> <p><strong>My sister died in 2008 </strong>and my brother died in 2020. I realised that whatever I did and however hard I tried to make my parents proud I couldn’t make them feel better about it. There’s disappointment with that, but also relief. I can’t control it, so I have to let it go.</p> <p><strong>Mum lived on her own</strong> during the pandemic, so we’d both watch <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/25/daytime-dream-the-chase-is-the-undisputed-king-of-quizshows\">The Chase</a></em> and I’d ring her afterwards to talk about it. Then I got the chance to go on and I was starstruck by Bradley Walsh. My Facebook cover photo is me with the Chasers, Mark Labbett and Anne Hegerty.</p> <p><em><strong>Mr Bates vs The Post Office</strong></em> affected people because they watched their worst nightmare unfold. I spoke to a subpostmaster whose children used to ask when he was going to jail. There’s been too many lies and people want to not feel helpless any more.</p> <p><strong>Accents are like scales</strong> on the piano. You do them slowly and hopefully they join up. A good dialect coach will tell you exactly where your tongue is meant to be, what you’ve missed, what to do more of. I learn the lines, do the psychological work, then the accent work separately.</p> <p><strong>Fear motivates me. </strong>I’m frightened of letting people down. Sometimes that can be inhibiting, but it’s also a strong signal to stretch yourself. When I played Rosemary West, I wanted to handle that the best way I could. I spoke to a lot of people about her.</p> <p><strong>It’s nice to contribute </strong>to something that has got everyone talking, but there needs to be proper accountability and proper compensation. The government knew about the injustice for a long time and what’s scaring them now is they’re having an election and people are angry. I expect very little from them and I receive it in abundance.</p> <p><strong>I wouldn’t describe</strong> my house as untidy, but I would say decisions are being made in real time. There’s stuff all over the place, boxes on the floor. I’m guilty of thinking things are still useful, like the VHS recorder that isn’t compatible with the telly.</p> <p><strong>The blessing and</strong> the curse of acting is that everyone you play becomes part of your psyche. I always refer to the character I’m playing in the third person, so you can talk about them objectively. That way, it never feels personal.</p> <p><strong>I’ve always regretted </strong>not going to Live Aid in 1985.

As matters stand, Trump is on course to win a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination and a possible second White House term.</p> <p>The bigger, worldwide picture is more alarming still. Far from being an exception to the rule, Trump reflects, amplifies and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/us/politics/trump-rhetoric-fascism.html\">popularises a regressive global trend</a> towards authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorial, nationalistic and religiously, ethnically and culturally majoritarian forms of rightwing governance.</p> <p>To put it more simply, fascism is once more on the march – and liberal democracy risks being trampled under its marauding boots. Is this a disagreeable hiccup, a passing phase? Or does it herald the start of a post-democratic age?</p> <p>Iowa was a reminder that Trump’s brand of nihilist anti-politics readily transcends the national borders he is so keen to fortify. It has near-universal, compelling appeal among those who distrust or feel betrayed by their leaders. Trump epitomises the big man, the national strongman, who vows to defend and support the little guy and his threatened shibboleths of identity and community. In return, he demands a dictator’s unlimited power and fealty.</p> <p>It’s the old-new deal of the century: security, uniformity, conformity and social validation for the dominant majority at the cost of civic freedoms, legal accountability, independent media, diversity and minority rights. This is the model in place, or gaining ground, from Beijing, Moscow and Delhi to Cairo and Buenos Aires, by way of Rome, Paris and Berlin.</p> <p>Trump’s approach to Iowa exemplified how anti-democratic anti-politics works. He mostly avoided rallies and meet-and-greets with voters, boycotted debates with rival candidates, and travelled, aloof, in a power-tripping motorcade of black secret service limousines. Yet his imperial mien, lavishly funded TV advertising and harsh take-no-prisoners policy agenda produced a record win.</p> <p>How can this be? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/us/politics/trump-iowa-win-voters.html\">Many voters candidly applaud Trump’s autocratic style</a>. Democracy, they say, has not delivered for them; and there are too many liberties, taken and assumed, in a too-woke world. They buy the lie he’s a victim of fake slanders confected by “deep state” opponents fearful of his righteous crusade to rescue America from itself.</p> <p>Some claim God sent him as saviour; that only he can halt apocalyptic national decline. And <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/trump-2024-president.html\">vengeance, Trump vows in biblical vein, will be theirs</a>. “I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” he declared last year. His is a classic, cultish conspiracy of untruth. Stalin, Mao or Louis XIV would recognise it. Like them, Trump seeks to rule absolutely.</p> <p>In his 2023 book, <em>The New Leviathans</em>, the English conservative philosopher John Gray develops a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/19/the-new-leviathans-by-john-gray-review-should-we-abandon-hope-and-prepare-for-anarchy\">general theory of democratic decline</a>. He argues western leaders and writers were sadly mistaken in their “grotesque notion” that the conclusion of the cold war in 1989-91 presaged a permanent “end-of-history” triumph of free societies and free markets.</p> <p>Instead, powerful rightwing dictatorships have emerged in Russia, China and elsewhere that are dragging the world back into the chaotic “state of nature” first described by Gray’s 17th-century predecessor, Thomas Hobbes. “Enclaves of freedom persist, but a liberal civilisation based on the practice of tolerance has passed into history,” Gray writes.</p> <p>Leaders such as Trump, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin – a modern-day personification of “nasty, brutish and short” – are, in effect, building upon Hobbes’s central idea of unfettered sovereign power (the Leviathan) in order to control and direct the lives of citizens, not merely protect and defend them, he argues. “Neo-totalitarian states today aim to deliver their subjects from the burdens of freedom ... The new Leviathans are engineers of souls.”</p> <p>While Gray concedes the path ahead is not entirely back to black, he believes the myth of an inexorably advancing progressive tendency is exploded. “The world of the future will be like that of the past, with disparate regimes interacting with one another in a condition of global anarchy.”</p> <p>Russia’s voters, who accord Putin high approval ratings, broadly resemble America’s Trumpers in valuing charisma over character, preferring the strongman to the right man, and turning a blind eye to corruption and lies. Yet Russia is not and never was fully democratic. Its example repels rather than attracts.</p> <p>China’s Communist party presents a bigger challenge to the western liberal democratic tradition in that it actively projects its state capitalist model internationally while fiercely controlling people’s lives and cultivating a single national culture and identity – as Tibetans and Uyghurs know to their cost. Gray likens Chinese society under Xi to Jeremy Bentham’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham\">Panopticon</a>, a vast imaginary prison where invasive surveillance is ubiquitous.</p> <p>“Enclaves of freedom” still hold out, yet their walls are besieged. India is succumbing to one-man rule, beguiled by the intolerant Hindu nationalism of Narendra Modi. Israel’s democracy is presently self-destructing. In Africa, coups abound. In Europe, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, scrambled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/17/emmanuel-macron-speech-press-conference-education-schooling-changes-screen-time-new-cabinet\">shore up the national project</a> last week against a surging far-right tide.</p> <p>In Germany, Italy and Hungary, much the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/meloni-urged-to-ban-neofascist-groups-after-crowds-filmed-saluting-in-rome\">struggle against a reviving fascism</a> is being fought (or conceded). So much so that Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/16/germans-take-to-streets-to-oppose-far-right-afds-mass-deportation-plan\">joined street protesters</a> to urge resistance to the anti-migrant, Nazi-linked Alternative for Germany party. In the UK, alienation and an anachronistic voting system turn elections into charades.</p> <p>In such countries, the battle is not yet over. But unity of purpose is lacking. As in the US, parliamentary and public institutions are weak and discredited. If Americans such as Iowa’s caucus-goers, relatively prosperous and secure, do not stand up for democracy and reject its subversive, disruptive foes, what hope is there for the rest?</p> <p>In truth, not much. The liberal moment, it appears, is passing; the fascist nightmare looms anew. Under darkly lowering skies, the post-democratic age dawns.</p>",

Thankfully, having the CT [computerised tomography] images meant they did not discover anything unexpected, and although it wasn’t a regular amputation, it was ‘uneventful’.</p> <p>“When we spoke, she was in recovery, having lots of love and fuss from the nursing team but all be reassured she’s doing well. We really hope she will now have an easy and quick recovery.”</p> <p>Mikey Lawlor, the founder and manager of Greenacres Rescue, told the BBC: “There were two procedures which lasted about two hours, but both went fine. The next day she was up, walking around and eating and drinking.</p> <p>“Now we just need to keep our fingers crossed she doesn’t get any infections, but she really is in the best hands.”</p> <p>It is hoped Ariel can be discharged this weekend to return home to her foster family in west Wales. </p> <p>“Then, after she’s had several weeks of physiotherapy and recovery, we’ll see about finding her a forever home,” Lawlor said.</p> <p>He told the BBC the response to Ariel’s story had been “incredible”, with calls and emails from as far away as Australia. “I just can’t say enough of a thank you to everyone who’s contributed to helping her,” he said.</p> <p>Vicki Black, the Langford Vets hospital director, said: “Ariel was a complicated little dog whose care required close collaboration across a number of our specialist-led teams including orthopaedics, soft-tissue surgery, anaesthesia and radiology.</p> <p>“We are delighted such a lovely dog has recovered from her surgery well.<br>As part of the University of Bristol, we are a centre committed to career-long learning and are proud to innovate and treat pets like Ariel.</p> <p>“Ariel deservedly has many devoted supporters. It was a great pleasure to treat her and work with Greenacres Rescue.”</p>",

Unfortunately he wasn’t in the best shape possible.”</p> <p>While Shang fell short in his bid to become the first Chinese man to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam in the Open era, the country will have a women’s singles player in the second week as 12th seed <strong>Zheng Qinwen</strong> beat <strong>Wang Yafan</strong>. Zheng, who was named the WTA Tour’s most improved player in the 2023 season after winning Asian Games gold and the Zhengzhou title, held off her plucky compatriot 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (8).</p> <p>The 21-year-old will no doubt be inspired by memories of Li Na’s triumphant campaign in 2014. “I watched that final 10 times,” said Zheng. “Unbelievable player, the first Asian woman who won a Grand Slam, how can you not remember that?” Zheng, who reached the quarter-finals of the U.S. Open last year, next plays <strong>Oceane Dodin</strong> after she prevailed in an all-French third-round duel with <strong>Clara Burel</strong> 6-2, 6-4.<br><br>It was the end of the road for former Flushing Meadows champion <strong>Sloane Stephens</strong> after the American lost 6-7 (8), 6-1, 6-4 to <strong>Anna Kalinskaya</strong>. By making it to the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time, Kalinskaya is already assured of her biggest payday - nearly $250,000 - though she seemed in no rush to spend it. “I don’t have anything in mind. I’ll take it easy,” said Kalinskaya, who faces Italian Jasmine Paolini next. “Maybe a nice purse.”</p> <p>French wildcard <strong>Arthur Cazaux</strong> sealed a breezy 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win over Dutch 28th seed <strong>Tallon Griekspoor</strong> to reach the last 16 at a major for the first time, where he will meet ninth seed <strong>Hubert Hurkacz</strong> of Poland. Hurkacz downed Frenchman <strong>Ugo Humbert</strong> 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-3.</p> <p><strong>Dayana Yastremska</strong> will return to the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time since Wimbledon 2019 after her 6-2, 2-6, 6-1 win over American 27th seed <strong>Emma Navarro</strong>. The Ukrainian next faces twice former champion <strong>Victoria Azarenka</strong>, who battled back from 4-1 down in the second set to beat 2017 French Open winner <strong>Jelena Ostapenko</strong> 6-1, 7-5.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-20T08:30:59.229Z\">at 8.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-65ab81518f082472faf437ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-20T08:19:58.184Z\">8.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Cameron Norrie has landed</strong> just 59% of his first serves so far, which is suboptimal.

            "body" : "<p>Alain Delon was among the greatest celebrities of the golden era of French cinema, with his brooding good looks, ice-blue eyes and seductive on- and off-screen presence making him the pin-up of postwar France.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/19/alain-delon-david-thomson\" title=\"\">career spanning more than half a century</a>, Delon made 90 films, many of them critically acclaimed, including <em>Plein Soleil</em> (<em>Purple Noon</em>) in which he played antihero Tom Ripley, <em>Le Samouraï</em> and the historical epic <em>The Leopard</em>, that drew an estimated 134 million cinema-goers, making him a star at the box office.</p> <p>But today, aged 88, and severely diminished by a stroke five years ago, Delon is playing his final role in a real-life drama resonant of a Greek or Shakespearean tragedy as his three children, Anthony, Anouchka and Alain-Fabien, squabble publicly in a destructive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/04/french-actor-alain-delon-to-file-legal-complaint-against-son\" title=\"\">flurry of accusations and legal actions</a>.</p> <p>So grubby has the washing of Delon family linen in the media become, the actor’s lawyer, Christophe Ayela, has had to call for a truce. “It has to stop and everyone needs to calm down. That’s enough now,” Ayela said.</p> <p>Behind the long stone wall marking the limits of the Delon estate, known as La Brûlerie, that stretches for 2.3km along the road to the village of Douchy-Montcorbon in the Loiret department of central France, the actor now lives a reclusive life. It is here, 140km south-east of Paris, that Delon has said he wishes to be buried, near the chapel constructed in the grounds of the cemetery he created for more than 30 of his beloved dogs.</p>    <p>Delon bought the property, a former holiday centre for rail workers’ children set in just under 300 acres of mostly wooded estate, in 1971. The 1,500 villagers are proud of their famous resident and profoundly discreet; the last time anyone saw the actor, reportedly also stricken with lymphoma, was at a film screening in nearby Château Renard last May. A photograph shows Delon looking relaxed, flanked by his now former Japanese companion, Hiromi Rollin, 66, who lived with the actor from 2019 until his children succeeded in evicting her from his home last summer.</p> <p>In a rare show of unity, all three accused Rollin of abusing their father’s weakness. She counter-accused them of trying to kill him by stopping his medical treatment. Lawyers were engaged; writs flew. Worse was to come.</p> <p>The first salvo in the sibling war came earlier this month when Anthony, 59, whose mother Nathalie was Delon’s only wife, accused his half-sister, Anouchka, 33, daughter of Dutch model and journalist Rosalie van Breemen, of “lying” and “manipulation” for allegedly hiding the results of cognitive tests Swiss doctors had performed on their father.</p> <p>Anouchka appeared on television to counter-attack. The lawyer, Ayela, said Delon was furious at the “media storm” created by his eldest son. But the third sibling, Anouchka’s brother 29-year-old Alain-Fabien, now living at La Brûlerie, leapt to Anthony’s defence, and secretly recorded his sister allegedly “dripping insinuations” into their father’s ear. More television appearances, accusations and writs followed.</p> <p>The public prosecutor ordered that Delon undergo an expert medical report and envisaged making him a ward of court after it suggested the actor had “lost all discernment”. Ayela and the children said this was nonsense. After a second medical examination, the lawyer said: “Monsieur Alain Delon responded to questions … confirming therefore that his discernment is not gone, contrary to the slanderous statements made in the media.”</p>    <p>The protagonists insist the feud is not about money; Delon’s will leaves half his fortune to his daughter and the other half divided between his sons. It is an inequitable disbursement but one they claim not to contest.</p> <p>Anthony and Alain-Fabien have had difficult relationships with their father and brushes with drugs, guns and the law. A third son, Ari Boulogne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/20/you-are-beautiful-and-you-are-alone-review-nico-as-the-gothic-garbo\" title=\"\">born to German rock star Nico</a> of the Velvet Underground – but whom the actor never recognised as his son – was partly raised by Delon’s mother. He died last year after a lifetime battling drug addiction.</p> <p><em>Le Monde</em> suggested that Delon’s own turbulent childhood left him incapable of establishing relationships with his sons. Delon was four when his parents divorced and he was sent to a foster home. He was subsequently expelled from six schools. “I was disruptive, very indisciplined so I was thrown out. I was a kind of little monster; very rough,” he said of this period.</p> <p>Delon did his military service in the French navy aged 17 and served in the Indochina war, but was court-martialled for stealing a jeep. Returning to Paris, he was living among prostitutes and gangsters in the late 1950s before being discovered as an actor.</p> <p>After a five-year relationship with Romy Schneider, Delon married Nathalie, then pregnant with Anthony, in 1964. The couple divorced four years later. Delon’s relationships with women were notorious, including persuading two actresses – Mireille Darc and Maddly Bamy – to engage in a <em>ménage à trois</em> in the late 1960s, declaring he was unable to decide which he loved best.</p> <p>Delon has never made any secret that Anouchka is his favourite child. “To no other woman have I so often said I love you,” he said in 2008, adding a decade later: “I have a daughter who is the love of my life, perhaps a little too much with regard to the others.” Observers have suggested Delon’s turbulent relationship with Anthony and Alain-Fabien – both actors – stems from seeing them as rivals. “No doubt his ego – as uncertain as it was immense – made him consider his sons as potential rivals who he needed to smash,” wrote <em>Le Monde</em>.</p> <p>The three children all claim Delon is ailing but lucid and aware of the feud, making these final family scenes even more tragic.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When Claudine Gay resigned as Harvard University president in early January, pundits credited her departure to a successful removal campaign led by conservative activists.</p> <p>The strategy behind Gay’s ousting wasn’t new, and has been used to advance conservative agendas, influence school curriculum and demonize Black people throughout history. What was different this time was the quick efficacy of the takedown, which, according to some political scientists, historians and lawyers, emboldened conservative activists and could have dangerous implications for the future of education.</p> <h2>Sustained and coordinated pressure</h2> <p>The campaign to drive Gay out was waged by vocal opponents of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1732632488227303784\">accused her</a> of being an unqualified diversity hire. “She got her job not through merit, but because she checked a box,” the Republican Ohio senator JD Vance <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JDVance1/status/1742925449465135262\">wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter) after her resignation.</p> <p>His post, according to Leah Watson, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, serves as an invitation for conservatives to use DEI as a dog whistle in the future, to invalidate anything from the progress of historically marginalized communities to medical research. On X, Vance went on to question the validity of credentials from universities with DEI programs, an unsubstantiated claim and a significant escalation in the attacks on higher education.</p> <p>Sustained and coordinated pressure through media coverage helped kick off the campaign against Gay. Critics, mainly conservative activists, used social media and news outlets to claim that she responded inadequately to congressional questioning about antisemitism on campus. Soon thereafter, they levied allegations that she plagiarized some of her work.</p> <p>Weeks prior to Gay’s resignation, the rightwing activist Christopher Rufo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1737209215738069232\">publicized</a> the plan to remove her from office: “We launched the Claudine Gay plagiarism story from the Right. The next step is to smuggle it into the media apparatus of the Left, legitimizing the narrative to center-left actors who have the power to topple her. Then squeeze.” In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/03/christopher-rufo-claudine-gay-harvard-resignation-00133618\">Politico</a> after Gay vacated her post, Rufo described his successful strategy as a three-pronged approach of “narrative, financial and political pressure”.</p> <p>Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, an associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, noted the effectiveness of the plan, and warned of what it could portend considering that these actors have “seen the impact that they can have when they are able to marshal pressure from the media, donors and others”.</p> <p>He pointed to similar strategies employed in the conservative movement to reshape state legislatures, where activists and lobbyists leverage understaffed and under-resourced statehouses by providing them with research and advice for bills in order to sway them. In his book State Capture, Hertel-Fernandez wrote about how the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council drafts and disseminates bills to apply political pressure. “They can have an outsized impact by diagnosing the weak spot in the institution and going after that,” said Hertel-Fernandez. “Just as they did in the case with Harvard.”</p> <p>Relying on allies within government was a key approach in Gay’s case as well, one that has also been used to further conservative agendas in the past. In the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/03/christopher-rufo-claudine-gay-harvard-resignation-00133618\">Politico interview</a>, Rufo said that he used the Republican congresswoman and Harvard alum Elise Stefanik as “political leverage”, calling her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/07/university-presidents-antisemitism-congress-testimony\">aggressive questioning of Gay</a> during the congressional hearing a “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/03/christopher-rufo-claudine-gay-harvard-resignation-00133618\">masterful performance</a>”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We’re seeing a more emboldened and expressed approach to eradicating spaces for Bipoc people,</p> <footer> <cite>Leah Watson of the American Civil Liberties Union</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“They use the actors and allies that they have inside of government to amplify those claims and turn them into a bigger narrative,” Hertel-Fernandez said. Previously, Rufo worked with lawmakers in Florida to craft conservative policies. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/30/conservative-christopher-rufo-florida-twitter-debate\">collaborated</a> with Governor Ron DeSantis to draft the “Stop Woke Act”, which banned schools and workplaces from teaching critical race theory, an academic and legal framework that examines structural racism in policies and institutions. Rufo also helped dismantle the New College of Florida’s <a href=\"https://www.ncf.edu/programs/gender-studies/\">gender studies</a> department and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-college-conservatives-dei-desantis-1a874270b0ff60951cdd8d3d35a10ec0\">DEI office</a> as a DeSantis-appointed board of trustee for the school.</p> <h2>Language as a weapon</h2> <p>The specific language used to characterize Gay was one of the most important tools in the conservative plan, according to John Tilghman, an associate professor and interim department chair of history and political science at Tuskegee University. Rufo’s allegations that Gay plagiarized throughout her career gave the impression “that she practiced academic dishonesty over a period of time”, Tilghman said. (In December, Gay added several new citations to articles that didn’t have proper attribution, and a <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/blog/2023/12/12/statement-from-the-harvard-corporation-our-president/\">Harvard review found no violation</a> of the university’s standards.)</p> <p>Tilghman sees parallels in Rufo’s strategy with those used by the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater, who helped George HW Bush win the 1988 presidential election against the then Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis.</p> <p>Dukakis had supported a prison weekend release program during which Willie Horton, a Black man, raped a white woman and stabbed her boyfriend. Atwater used rhetoric to sow fear and racial animus among white voters by creating a campaign that focused on Horton and portrayed Dukakis as being lenient on crime.</p> <p>“It was all part of Bush’s campaign of tough on crime, by using racial code words and dog whistling language to do that,” Tilghman said. “Christopher Rufo is mostly using that same playbook, but he’s applied it to higher education and high school education.”</p> <p>In the Harvard case, activists tapped into existing fears in the center-left coalition about diversity and the ascension of people of color to power, said Hertel-Fernandez. Some of them latched on to the “great replacement theory” – a racist ideology that asserts people of color will replace white people. (Notably, the theory was the motivation behind the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/a-deadly-ideology-how-the-great-replacement-theory-went-mainstream\">murder</a> of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket.)</p> <p>“We’re seeing a more emboldened and expressed approach to eradicating spaces for Bipoc people,” the ACLU’s Watson said. “Racist ideology isn’t new; extreme rightwing conservatives are using the same tools repeatedly, and publicizing their playbook so it can be used to attack anything from evidence-based public health advice to election results, and equal opportunity and access.”</p> <p>Conservative activists have signaled that the Harvard case is only the beginning of their quest to take down institutions with opposing agendas. According to Watson, the courts may serve as the only protection against the further erosion of educational and racial justice advancements in the future.</p>",

At sunset each day, <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/elektra-by-christof-loy-details\">Elektra</a></strong> howls in grief for her father, Agamemnon, murdered years earlier by her mother, Klytämnestra. Bored housemaids watch and sneer. Richard Strauss’s 1909 opera, to a libretto of exceptional richness by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, keeps the focus simple. Family niceties (past infanticide and the like) are swept away. This daughter has one purpose: to kill her mother and avenge her father. Her daily stomp of mourning – graceless, elegiac and vehement as portrayed by Nina Stemme, one of the great Elektras of her generation, in the Royal Opera House’s new production – is an unholy dance of death.</p> <p>In his last new production as music director of the Royal Opera House, Antonio Pappano has once again collaborated with Christof Loy, who directed Strauss’s <em>Ariadne auf Naxos</em> in 2002 at the start of Pappano’s long tenure. Designed by Johannes Leiacker, with lighting by Olaf Winter, the look is secession Vienna at the time of <em>Elektra</em>’s composition: a soot-dirty palace courtyard and flight of steps; a basement where lowly staff dwell; illuminated upper windows past which glamorous figures in dinner dress glide without purpose. The sets give strong context to Elektra’s world, as seen by the opera’s creators in the early 20th century, when Sigmund Freud’s theories were fresh and the first world war was still out of view.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With its singular, undefinable power, Jenůfa leaves the listener altered – on every hearing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even more inventive than <em>Salome</em> (1905) before it, <em>Elektra</em> is an unyielding work. Inexorable, noisy, riven with chromatic battles, the score flashes between dark and light, major and minor, high drama and yet greater extremes of emotion. Using every means in his armoury – who knows what they are; not abracadabras but persuasion and hard graft – Pappano drew playing of immaculate variety from the enlarged ROH orchestra. The clue to this opera is its musical polarities. Shadows, whispers and chamber-like delicacy allow for depth and mercy: brief waltzes that sweeten a landscape steeped in blood; yawns and yowls of low woodwind when Klytämnestra describes her night terrors; wisps of harp or solo strings when Elektra realises her hideous, obsessive desire is about to be fulfilled. Every detail was audible here, lovingly etched and nurtured.</p>    <p>Into this sonic panoply, the voices of three women – Elektra, her sister Chrysothemis, and Klytämnestra – are forged, almost hammered, woven into the texture. Vocal problems were evident on first night, but did not dent the rewards of the whole. Karita Mattila’s superbly imperious, bejewelled Klytämnestra lacked heft, but so does this liverish, guilt-ridden murderess herself. Stemme had more specific difficulties, which she at once recognised and negotiated with top professionalism. These two stars, each now having tipped into their seventh decade, bring class and experience to any stage. Sara Jakubiak made a striking Royal Opera debut, vocally triumphant, dramatically thoughtful as Chrysothemis, who dreams of motherhood and matricide in the same breath. Orest, the absent son, is unknowable in Strauss and Hofmannsthal’s reading: Łukasz Goliński played him exactly that way. As if designed to carry out a deed, he kills his mother and her lover, Ägisth, like a bloodied AI automaton.</p> <p>The supporting cast had notable cameos: five maids, including Valentina Puskás; Lee Bisset as Overseer; and, in the slender male roles, Michael Gibson, Michael Mofidian, Charles Workman and Jeremy White. Before the second performance (Monday), Nina Stemme withdrew, citing illness. Her replacement, a regular Elektra in European houses, was the Lithuanian Ausrine Stundyte, making her house debut ahead of her intended first appearance next month <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/tosca-by-jonathan-kent-details\">as Tosca</a>. By chance, for the experience of hearing Strauss’s orchestration played at this level once more, I had arranged to go again for my own interest. Admiration is the only response to anyone stepping in, with all the attendant risks, to a new production. Elektra is barely off the stage for the 100-minute duration.</p> <p>The ROH was prepared for such an eventuality: Stundyte had rehearsal time with Loy before Christmas. Her voice is lighter, her performance more cat-like (as befits the text) than Stemme, whose interpretation is of a woman ravaged, bearing the weight of the world. With every excuse allowable, Stundyte only got into her vocal stride late on, especially after the recognition scene with Orest. I look forward to hearing her Tosca, in safer circumstances.</p> <p>Pappano, on his night off, was in the capacity audience for <strong>Jenůfa</strong> (1904), in the second of two concert performances given by his new ensemble, the London Symphony Orchestra. Now LSO conductor emeritus, Simon Rattle led a sterling cast in the orchestra’s ongoing Leoš Janáček cycle (<em>The Cunning Little Vixen</em> is already out <a href=\"https://lsolive.lso.co.uk/products/janacek-the-cunning-little-vixen-sinfonietta\">on LSO Live</a>; <em>Katya Kabanova</em> is due for release <a href=\"https://lsolive.lso.co.uk/collections/sacd-hybrid/products/lso0889\">next month</a>). From the opening xylophone reveille – depicting the clattering mill wheel – to the brassy, terrifying volleys that end each act, the work unfurled with urgent momentum and intensity. In this tale of Moravian village life, Jenůfa’s illegitimate child brings shame to her pietistic stepmother, Kostelnička. Tragedy ensues. The opera concludes with fragile optimism and lessons in acceptance. Rampant with melodies, some of which surface for a few bars never to return, this masterpiece, with its singular, undefinable power, leaves the listener altered – on every hearing. Tomorrow, for any keen date spotter, will be 120 years exactly since <em>Jenůfa</em>’s premiere (21 January 1904, Mahen theatre, Brno).</p>    <p>Here too, the title role was sung, but with longer notice than for <em>Elektra</em>, by a replacement. Agneta Eichenholz, bringing a different balance to the ensemble, stood in for the steely-toned Asmik Grigorian. Eichenholz’s clear, bright tone, if not always the strongest in volume, conveyed the young mother’s heartbreak and vulnerability. As Števa, who abandons her, Nicky Spence – well suited to this repertoire – was alone in bringing his acting chops to the stage (this was not a semi-staging), supporting himself drunkenly on music stands and flexing his shoulders with oafish swagger.</p> <p>Aleš Briscein’s Laca, first jealous then loyal in forgiveness, made terrific use of his shrill, gleaming high tones. Katarina Karnéus’s Kostelnička, dignified and pained, elicited unusual sympathy. Carole Wilson’s Grandmother and Claire Barnett-Jones’s Herdswoman/Barena, both characterful, spiced up the drama. The LSO chorus and orchestra gave their all, leader Benjamin Marquise Gilmore’s violin notably persuasive, but all instrumental solos superbly taken. Strings were well drilled. Violas, sitting on the outside of the cellos, took their limelight moments with outstanding stamina.</p>    <p>Let’s hear it for the looping intelligence and adaptability (not to mention any financial need) of Britain’s complex musical life, worth acknowledging in a week of this quality. As it happened, the LSO’s viola section guest leader, <a href=\"https://www.adderburyensemble.com/jane-atkins-viola/\">Jane Atkins</a>, had played solo viola the previous night at Kings Place. The event was part of the opening weekend in the venue’s year-long <a href=\"https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/scotland-unwrapped/\">Scotland Unwrapped</a> series. Five members of <strong><a href=\"https://scottishensemble.co.uk/musician/\">Scottish Ensemble</a></strong>, including Atkins, joined forces with <strong><a href=\"https://www.jasdeepsinghdegun.com/\">Jasdeep Singh Degun</a></strong> (sitar) and <a href=\"https://soundstorm-music.org.uk/blog/meet-a-musician-harkiret-singh-bahra/\">Harkiret Singh Bahra</a> (tabla) for a quixotic programme spanning north Indian raga to Hildegard of Bingen. As Degun joked, he had misheard the medieval nun’s status of “abbess” as “abscess”. I’ve never been too certain about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/08/hildegard-bingen-fiona-maddocks-review#comments\">Hildegard</a>’s sense of humour, and she certainly wasn’t Scottish, but she would surely have found this union of musics pretty celestial.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Elektra </em><strong>★★★★</strong><em><br>Jenůfa </em><strong>★★★★</strong><em><br>Scottish Ensemble with Jasdeep Singh Degun </em><strong>★★★★</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/elektra-by-christof-loy-details\">Elektra</a></em><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/elektra-by-christof-loy-details\"> is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London, until 30 January</a></p></li> </ul>",

After self-releasing a string of singles, they have now made their major-label debut album – in the studio where Oasis recorded <em>Morning Glory</em>. <em>Madra</em> (Irish for “dog”) doesn’t include the early flashes of brilliance of shimmeringly beautiful 2020 single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB2M71Y4SYk\">Blue</a>, but the band’s music is more potent now – a tide rather than a wash of sound.</p> <p>NewDad find a winning immediacy and intimacy amid existential angst that’s reminiscent of the Cure, Wolf Alice or New Order – particularly thanks to Dawson’s deadpan singing style, its candyfloss fragility concealing vicious lyrics. Angel, <em>Madra’</em>s excellent first track, begins: “You’re sweet, but I’m sick/ I hurt myself for kicks.” As Dawson <a href=\"https://readdork.com/features/hype-list-2024-newdad/\">told </a><em><a href=\"https://readdork.com/features/hype-list-2024-newdad/\">Dork</a></em><a href=\"https://readdork.com/features/hype-list-2024-newdad/\"> magazine</a>, “a lot of the album touches on difficult relationships, either with other people or with yourself”.

Now in his late 20s, he has become a probing, thoughtful player, directing his exciting virtuosity at the service of a wide range of composers. His third album, <strong><a href=\"https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/la-danse\">La Danse</a></strong> (Warner), restricted to French works, makes a chronological passage through dance from baroque to 20th-century: from Jean-Philippe Rameau to Maurice Ravel, via François Couperin, Claude Debussy and, with fellow pianist Alexandre Tharaud, Reynaldo Hahn.</p> <p>At the head of his programme note Bartlett quotes Ravel’s words about his <em>Le Tombeau de Couperin</em>, a memorial to friends lost in the first world war, and the album’s central work: “The dead are sad enough, in their eternal silence.” You hear the parallels between the transparent, incisive writing of Couperin and the buoyant elegy Ravel wrote in homage to his musical forerunner. Variety, delight and seriousness combine in this recital. Bartlett concludes with that dizzying, waltzing masterpiece, Ravel’s La Valse.</p>    <p>• Ideas of transfiguration underpin <strong>Arvo Pärt</strong>’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xWVCSRtoM4\">Littlemore Tractus</a> (2000), a choral work originally for voices with organ but now accompanied by an insistent, rocking string figuration and tolling bells. Recorded in Tallinn’s Methodist church in September 2022, performed by the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir conducted by Tõnu Kaljuste, it opens the Estonian composer’s latest album, <strong><a href=\"https://ecmrecords.com/product/arvo-part-tractus-estonian-philharmonic-chamber-choir-tallinn-chamber-orchestra-tonu-kaljuste/\">Tractus</a></strong> (ECM). This quietly ecstatic piece sets words by Cardinal John Henry Newman (whose poem Elgar used for his choral work <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>). Other works here, some rearranged, include Greater Antiphons, Cantiques des degrés, Sequentia and Veni creator. As ever with Pärt, ancient shakes hands with modern in music forever on the edge of silence.</p> <p>• The Italian conductor <strong>Claudio Abbado</strong> died <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/20/claudio-abbado-italian-conductor-dies\">a decade ago</a>.

No doubt some hotels would allow you to hire a manual hoist but in general these are not available for short-term periods and would double the cost of any stay, further adding to the <a href=\"https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/extra-costs/disability-price-tag-2023/\">disability price tag</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Things are better if you search online for fully accessible holidays</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Things don’t get much better when you search <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/accessibility\">Airbnb</a>. After ticking all the accessibility features on its website, including a hoist, I found a single log cabin – in Devon. It looked really nice but was less than an hour from home and prices were just shy of £200 a night. Availability in the summer months was already very limited, highlighting the demand for such accommodation.</p> <p>Things are better if you search online for <a href=\"https://m.disabledholidays.com/#!/search/uk-l23/england-l24/?pg=8\">fully accessible holidays</a>. There you can find more availability as owners have cottoned on to the potential marketplace and have gone that extra mile to ensure peace of mind for their visitors. Most properties clearly list and detail their services, so there are no hidden surprises, and the owners seem to get what it’s all about and are subsequently rewarded with repeat bookings. On social media, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Accessible.hols.places.days/\">private groups of people</a>, many with first-hand experience of disability and finding suitable places to stay, have come together to source and recommend accessible properties for those seeking them. It builds a community of like-minded folk helping each other out and sharing their knowledge and endorsements.<br><br>Nothing comes cheap in this day and age, and a four-day off-season break could set you back more than £600. That’s great if you can afford it. But most of the properties are set in rural locations, which means city breaks are all but ruled out.<br><br>The hotel industry could learn much from the fully accessible holiday sector and even benefit from it. The <a href=\"https://www.visitbritain.org/business-advice/make-your-business-accessible-and-inclusive/discover-value-purple-pound\">“purple pound”</a> is worth £16bn a year to the domestic tourism market – a fifth of which goes on overnight stays. In the grand scheme of things, a ceiling hoist would be a small investment (£4k or £5k) for most hotels, wouldn’t need to spoil the aesthetics of a room and would probably increase financial returns.</p>",

But studios and publishers, both in the UK and around the world, are now making cutbacks to compensate for an underwhelming growth after a pandemic-driven boom for video games failed to continue. That has only been worsened by the economic downturn and inflation.</p> <p>Announced cuts at games studios worldwide suggest at least 10,500 staff lost their jobs last year, but given that dozens of the 170 companies involved did not reveal the number of staff affected, the true figure is likely to be significantly higher.</p> <p>Globally, those cuts included the gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA), which is behind major series such as Fifa, Battlefield and The Sims. Other big names in the industry, including Bethesda, <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/23/activision-blizzard-raven-software-union-vote\">Activision Blizzard</a> and CD Projekt RED, were also badly affected.</p> <p>Ukie, the UK’s main video games industry body, claims that around 900 of an estimated 11,100 job losses were roles based in the UK, equivalent to more than one in 30 of all those employed by the sector in the UK.</p> <p>“It’s felt like a deluge of redundancies in the past five or six months. It just keeps coming and coming,” said Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers branch. “And with this wave, I’ve seen people saying ‘we need to join unions’. Our membership went through the roof. We had the largest growth of new members in any month in our five-year history at the end of last year.”</p> <p>The union was first formed five years ago amid growing concerns among video games workers over precarious working conditions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/22/activision-blizzard-sued-frat-boy-culture-allegations\" title=\"\">endemic sexism at certain studios</a> and constant excess overtime (a practice known as the “crunch”).</p> <p>The pace of job losses seems unlikely to slow as at least 17 studios have already announced plans for further redundancies affecting thousands of employees.</p> <p>In one case, Unity, a video game software firm that makes the engine used as a base for many of the world’s most popular games, including Among Us and Cuphead, announced it would be cutting off 25% of its workforce, or some 1,800 employees.</p> <p>“It has been difficult to hear of the job losses in the video games sector over the recent few months,” said Ukie co-CEO Daniel Wood. “Our analysis suggests this is a rebalancing following successive years of significant growth during the pandemic.</p> <p>“We continue to work hard to ensure the UK remains a great place to start and scale up games businesses, and we urge the government to use the budget to create the conditions needed for games businesses to grow.”</p>",

Their operators were hidden a few hundred metres away in the dense forest. As the images on their screens indicated the drone fleet was hovering exactly above the target – a key military base in the town of Lailenpi – they hit the button on their controllers and bombs began to fall.</p> <p>“We had precise hits,” said Noah, 20, one of the specialist drone fighters in the Chin National Army (CNA), one of the ethnic rebel groups who have been fighting Myanmar’s military for almost three years. “It took them by surprise. We killed many, including the second-in-command of the base.”</p> <p>After three days of fighting, the rebels hoisted their tricolour flag over the base and shouted slogans of victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/archive-2-zip/giv-13425nLVdSr1JzhsH/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/archive-2-zip/giv-13425nLVdSr1JzhsH/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In the bloody war between the military junta, who toppled the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and seized control in a coup in February 2021, and the rebel groups who have been fighting to restore democracy since, a significant shift has been taking place.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/nov/27/the-guardian-view-on-myanmars-military-the-generals-are-in-trouble\" title=\"\">junta has now lost control</a> of more than 50% of the country, and in Chin state, which borders India, the CNA rebel forces say they have managed to capture back 70% of the province, including five key military bases.</p> <p>The secret to their recent victories, they say, is a new fleet of drones and an army of rebel soldiers – most of whom were once ordinary civilians – who have spent over a year training to operate them. “Drones have been key to our success,” said Ram Kulh Cung, the CNA’s assistant general secretary. “The attacks, like those at Lailenpi, have been carried out after months of planning and training.”</p> <p>During a recent visit to Camp Victoria, the central headquarters of the CNA in Chin state, they showed the <em>Observer</em> the vast fleet of thousands of commercial and agricultural drones – otherwise known as unmanned aerial vehicles – they had imported, mostly from China but also from western countries such as the United States, to hit the junta-controlled territory in targeted attacks.</p> <p>Since the military, known as the Tatmadaw, took power, they have overseen a brutal nationwide crackdown. Its soldiers have been accused of arbitrary arrests, torture, mass killings, rapes and abuses that, according to Human Rights Watch, amount to crimes against humanity. More than 4,000 civilians have been reported to have been killed in the conflict since the coup.</p>    <p>Until recently, the military have had the heavy advantage of a highly technical air force, which has been used to carry out hundreds of deadly airstrikes – often targeting areas of resistance – which have killed thousands.</p> <p>Yet the fleet of fighter jets is costly for the junta to maintain and operate, and increasingly proving no match for the drones being cheaply and expertly utilised by the rebel armies against the military-controlled areas.</p> <p>Junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun conceded that they had been facing heavy assaults and the insurgents had been using drones to drop hundreds of bombs on military posts.</p> <p>Indian army officials said that most of the border posts on the Myanmar side had been either overrun by rebels or are under threat. In the past two months, more than 400 Myanmar army soldiers have fled across the border to the Indian state of Mizoram, following rebel attacks.</p> <p>So successful has the drones technology been in rebel warfare that the junta has also started using commercial drones to carry out attacks but has lacked the necessary training to use them as efficiently as the rebel fighters.</p> <p>“The use of drones has created a tectonic shift in Myanmar’s battlefield,” said Angshuman Choudhury, an associate fellow at Delhi-based thinktank Centre for Policy Research. “They have not completely closed the tactical asymmetry between the military and resistance forces, but have diminished it significantly.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Junta rank and file are being watched discreetly, and could be attacked from the air anytime, anywhere – something that was absolutely unthinkable before the coup</p> <footer> <cite>Angshuman Choudhury, military analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He said the drones have created a “sense of fear among the junta rank-and-file that they are being watched discreetly and could be attacked from the air anytime, anywhere – something that was absolutely unthinkable before the coup.”</p> <p>The CNA is now one of the rebel armies that has a dedicated drones department, established over a year ago, whose footsoldiers have learned to operate the technology mostly through months of operational practice and tutorials on YouTube.</p> <p>“The drone department consists of skilled young fighters – some who were engineering students and some who have gained knowledge of drones as a hobby,” said Cung. “The department also relies hugely on the internet to upgrade the skills and train more people.”</p> <p>The technology, said Cung, was “turning the tables” but added: “Procuring weapons and drones is not easy for us. There is nothing easy in war.”</p> <p>Commanders said that most of the military equipment was coming in via the borders with China and Thailand rather than through India, which had been keeping a tight control on any kind of weapons inflow.</p>    <p>CNA leadership also attributed the recent successes of the resistance forces to a greater alliance and increased coordination between the different armed ethnic minority groups fighting the junta across Myanmar, who in the past had not always worked harmoniously due to differing priorities and infighting.</p> <p>In late October, three insurgent groups – known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance – launched “Operation 1027”, to take on junta troops in Shan state near Myanmar’s border with China. Furthering the nationwide momentum behind the assault, other rebel groups, including the Arakan Army and CNA, supported the operation from their own regions. Ultimately, several towns and more than 100 military outputs were taken from the junta in the offensive.</p> <p>Last week, in what many took as a sign of the growing weakness of the junta, the military and an alliance of rebel groups announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/12/myanmar-junta-and-armed-rebels-agree-ceasefire\" title=\"\">China-mediated ceasefire</a> along Myanmar’s border with China. However, the CNA was not party to it and commanders told the <em>Observer </em>they would not be abiding by it in Chin state.</p> <p>At Camp Victoria headquarters, every morning hundreds of newly recruited cadets – who get just a few months training before being sent to the frontlines – take part in a parade. Yet even as morale was high following the recent spate of victories, the nearby cemetery also revealed how this battle is still not an easy one. More than two dozen young fighters killed in the recent operations had been laid to rest, their tombstones engraved with lines of valour honouring their actions in battle.</p>    <p>But with drones opening up a new frontier of warfare for Myanmar’s rebel armies, Sabu, 49, a commander in the CNA’s drones department, was among those who felt a renewed confidence in their chances of defeating the junta.</p> <p>“We were bad at using them initially and missed most of the targets in the first year,” he said.</p> <p>However, the dedicated training was now paying off, he said, and several of their recent successful ground offensives against the junta had been preceded by pre-dawn drone strikes. “Drones are our air force,” said Sabu.</p> <p>“We will win this war with them.”</p>",

She first appeared on the Sun’s&nbsp;Page 3 at 18, under the name Jordan. A master of&nbsp;merchandising, she spent the noughties making millions from her&nbsp;glamour shoots, perfumes, autobiographies, novels and children’s&nbsp;books, as well as appearances on reality TV shows. She&nbsp;has five children, and has been married three times.

I was well into my career, shooting with Loaded and FHM, and I felt lucky as I was pregnant with Harvey [Price’s eldest son]. No bankruptcies, no breakdowns. It was an amazing time. Apart from the hair extensions. They were shocking back then.</p> <p>I’m in that see-through dress because I was going out. What else was I supposed to do? I was 22. Just because I was pregnant, it didn’t mean I couldn’t go to parties in my nine-inch skirts with my belly out. Unfortunately, the press would take pictures of me coming out of venues with my eyes half-blinking, trying to make me look like I was pissed, when I&nbsp;actually used to drive to the club and back in my Range Rover.</p> <p>My troubles with men started after this picture was taken. I saw photos of&nbsp;Dwight [Yorke, Harvey’s biological father] coming out of a nightclub holding a model’s hand. I&nbsp;realised then: “I’m done. I can’t be&nbsp;with you.” I&nbsp;knew I was going to be a single parent, but deep down I&nbsp;wasn’t worried as I had my family.</p> <p>My sister and mum are my everything. They moan at me all the&nbsp;time, but they are there for me always. Growing up, Mum was strict and I&nbsp;wasn’t allowed to go out, but at the same time I watched her being social and having house parties. When&nbsp;Soph was born, I was so excited. I&nbsp;used to pinch her as I&nbsp;wanted her to cry as an excuse to pick her up – “It’s all right Mum, I’ll get her!” I was obsessed with my baby&nbsp;sister.</p> <p>I’ve always been extroverted. At&nbsp;Dad’s 30th, I turned up in a leather catsuit. I was only 13. Even at school&nbsp;I&nbsp;was an exhibitionist, and told&nbsp;everyone I was going to be on TV.&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew I wouldn’t have a normal job. I&nbsp;wanted a big house in the countryside, a fairytale wedding, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a famous pop star or a model, and&nbsp;to work with horses. I’ve achieved it all – and more. The only thing on my list that I haven’t got yet is a black convertible Suzuki Vitara.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted a big house in the country, a fairytale wedding, to be famous and work with horses. I’ve achieved it all and beyond</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It took me until my 40s to process a&nbsp;lot of past experiences. My industry is so fast-paced, and I never got a&nbsp;chance to get over my breakups. The&nbsp;media are on me straight away, and I’m meant to just move on. If you don’t process things, they will all hit you at once and then you crash. That’s what happened to me in 2021. I was breaking down, and the only time my family realised something was wrong was if I did something stupid, like when I crashed the car. [Price received a 16-week suspended sentence after flipping her car while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.]</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/30/ian-and-riley-broudie-look-back-lightning-seeds\">Ian and Riley Broudie look back: ‘My dad expresses his feelings best in his lyrics. If he can’t say something, he hides it in a song’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I used to put on a facade and hide my feelings, but I realised through therapy that communication is key. My&nbsp;family are now so on top of my mental health that if I go quiet for a&nbsp;day I’ll get loads of missed calls and they’ll message friends to find out where I&nbsp;am. Chances are I’m either sorting out the kids’ dirty clothes or&nbsp;wandering around John Lewis. But&nbsp;I&nbsp;love that they are there for me, no&nbsp;matter what time, night or day.</p> <h2><strong>S</strong><strong>ophie</strong></h2> <p>Before this photo was taken, I would have been prancing around in Mum’s bedroom and Dad would have shouted “Everyone, get in for a photo!” I was only 12 and the whole outfit was Kate’s. I always used to nick her clothes. It was one of the first times I&nbsp;had used hair straighteners. They were Kate’s as well.</p> <p>I had a bit of a rough time at school because of Kate’s fame. It was horrible. I was in my early teens when she was getting more well known, and those years for girls are tricky for girls anyway. My brother, Dan, had mates who had posters of Kate on their bedroom walls, but I got stick from other girls. It got so bad, Mum moved me to a school in the countryside, thinking it would be better, but the bullying was worse, so I&nbsp;had to go back to my old school. I was so worried about what people might say about me that it affected my learning. In the long run, it also made me stronger.</p> <p>Me and Kate have always been close&nbsp;and have never fallen out. She&nbsp;dressed me for my prom, doing my&nbsp;makeup and putting in hair extensions. Every&nbsp;day, she would pick&nbsp;me up at 6.30am and we would muck out the horses before school together. When Mum was working in London, Kate used to babysit me, so if she had an appearance at a Max Power [performance car] show, I used to go along. It’s funny to think of this huge model turning up with a 10-year-old holding her hand.</p> <p>There’s been a role reversal in the last five years. Kate’s been a bit more vulnerable, and I’ve had a motherly instinct to protect her and keep her on track, to make sure she’s on top of her diary. People don’t know how sensitive she is, and the media can be so negative. But I’ve always thought of&nbsp;her as a beautiful chaos.</p> <h2><strong>A</strong><strong>my</strong></h2> <p>It was quite exciting when Kate got pregnant – we were getting the baby stuff together and I was knitting a lot. But this set-up, all of us on the bed together, is still what we do now. Whenever Sophie and Kate are here, we have coffee and chat together on my bed. Nothing’s changed.</p> <p>Kate was a bit sickly when she was born – she had whooping cough and a&nbsp;hole in her heart that healed over – but they were both really good babies&nbsp;in general. Believe it or not, until the age of 10, Kate was this little shy girl. She had such thin legs and would wear four pairs of tights at the same time, and all she was interested in was horses. Boys didn’t come into it&nbsp;until later. </p> <p>I’ve always found Kate’s cosmetic surgery ridiculous. Her boobs are bigger than her head, for God’s sake! There have been times where she tells me what she’s getting done, and I’ll call up and cancel it before she goes. The problem is that she has body dysmorphia. Whenever she has a&nbsp;crisis&nbsp;that upsets her, she’ll get some&nbsp;surgery, and if she can’t do more&nbsp;surgery, then she’ll get tattoos. It’s her version of having her hair done. I don’t know what she sees in the mirror that we can’t, because Kate looking natural is just beautiful.</p> <p>My wishes for the future are that&nbsp;Sophie keeps going as she is, as&nbsp;she’s doing so well, and for Kate to&nbsp;feel more settled. She puts on a&nbsp;hard&nbsp;front sometimes, but I know she’s not tough. All I want for Kate is&nbsp;peace of mind and happiness.</p>",

Aggie Beever-Jones found herself doing just that towards the end of last year after the former academy player scored five in five WSL games.</p> <p>A cruel twist of fate ended their competition before it got going, with the Australian striker, on four league goals, the latest player to suffer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/07/sam-kerr-setback-highlights-impact-of-acl-injuries-in-womens-game\">a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury</a>. Kerr was injured running in Morocco, where Chelsea spent some time before the season restarted after Christmas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/18/ive-never-understood-why-anyone-would-want-to-be-a-referee-now-i-do\">I’ve never understood why anyone would want to be a referee. Now I do</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking from Morocco, and before Kerr’s knee injury, Beever-Jones, now tasked with stepping up in her teammate’s absence, reflected on an electric start to the season and the mouthwatering prospect of playing Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. “I don’t think I ever thought this would happen,” says the forward. “As cliche as it is, I’m living the dream right now.”</p> <p>Beever-Jones is a Chelsea fan from a Chelsea family and is a self-confessed fantasy football addict. She came through the Blues’ academy and in 2020-21 made one FA Cup and two league appearances for the senior side before being sent out on loan. First with Bristol City, where she scored seven goals in 27 games in all competitions. Last season, at Everton, she hit three goals in 21 games.</p> <p>Emma Hayes has made no secret of the fact that it can be a long process for players to achieve the standards she demands in the first team . Before the new season, on the introduction of her new signings, the Chelsea manager said: “It always takes time for players to settle into the environment because of the level of play and the intensity of the training. The expectations and demands don’t just happen in a short period.”</p> <p>That can be frustrating for fans, who are desperate to see exciting new prospects thrive, but the careful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/26/chelsea-leicester-wsl-match-report\">introduction of Lauren James</a> after her move from Manchester United is testament to the patient preparation of players by Hayes, who was “building Lauren for the long term”.</p> <p>Beever-Jones is the latest player to be reaping the benefits of putting trust in the manager and it was an attentiveness during her loan spells that made her think a Chelsea return was likely. “It’s all dependent on how well you do on loan and obviously anything can happen, you could get an injury,” she says.</p>    <p>“I’ve always made short-term goals. I did well at Bristol and that’s when me and Chelsea spoke a lot and we felt the next step for me was to go out on loan to a WSL side. I had a few clubs come knocking at the door and I think Everton seemed like the best fit. Chelsea had a good relationship with Brian [Sørensen, the Everton coach] which I think really helped us narrow in on what I needed to work on.”</p> <p>There were always underlying fears of not coming home, though. “There are moments where you can be a bit uncertain on what the next step might be,” says Beever-Jones. “But the Chelsea staff were brilliant at keeping me up to date with what was going through their heads and listening to what was going through mine.”</p> <p>Chelsea have been repaid by her performances this season. Before the last England camp of the year, Beever-Jones was the highest-scoring English player in the WSL. She wasn’t called up, but Sarina Wiegman said she was in “our conversations” and hopes “she just keeps improving and gives us headaches again with our selection”.</p> <p>“Nice to hear,” says Beever-Jones. “But I don’t really ever want to get too caught up on it and think I’ve made it before I have, because I’ve still got a long way to go in my career.</p> <p>“We can be guilty of it as a young player, wanting everything straight away, and there’s no harm in me being in the under-23s and getting that game time there. As long as I’m making Emma and Sarina happy, then I’m happy.”</p> <p>Keeping a cool head is very much the Chelsea way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/10/arsenal-chelsea-wsl-match-report\">A tough 4-1 defeat by Arsenal</a> at the start of December saw the Blues overtaken by their London rivals, but the following week Arsenal dropped points at Tottenham and Chelsea were top again with a win over Bristol City.</p> <p>Now, they play Manchester United to restart their league campaign after coming from behind against West Ham in the FA Cup last weekend. As a Chelsea fan, playing at Stamford Bridge is special. Beever-Jones started in their last outing there and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/18/chelsea-liverpool-womens-super-league-match-report\">scored in the 5-1 defeat of Liverpool</a>.</p> <p>“Every time I talk about it I just have a massive smile on my face,” she says. “I’ve watched it back a fair few times. That whole day was just an absolute dream come true and having my family there was the icing on the cake.</p> <p>“I did a knee slide as well. I don’t think I even dreamt as a kid of doing a knee slide at Stamford Bridge. I’m just so happy with everything at the moment and I’ve got to keep doing what I’m doing.”</p>",

We’re regionally focused; we can expand from there to states,” he said.</p> <p>The announcement was hailed on by <a href=\"https://archive.ph/CA1HG\">others</a> on the far right. But experts say that while the move reflects a longer trend of religious conservatives withdrawing from a broader society whose liberal values they reject, there may be more than meets the eye in the HRP.</p> <p>“Utopian communities have long been a feature of the American landscape, but this may be more of a money-driven land speculation project with a culture war angle than an effort to create a utopian project in the classic sense”, said <a href=\"https://katherinestewart.me/\">Katherine Stewart</a>, author of The Power Worshippers, a key book on Christian nationalism.</p> <p><a href=\"https://globalextremism.org/heidi-beirich-ph-d/\">Heidi Beirich</a>, co-founder and chief strategy officer of the Global Project against Hate and Extremism, said the developments raised questions about just who would move there.</p> <p>“Is there going to be something that are along the lines of like a version of a modern day racial covenant related to this land? How are you going to impose political views on your buyers? What are the litmus tests going to be?”</p> <p>The Federal Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and other categories in the sale of housing.</p> <p>The Guardian asked Abbotoy via email whether he reserved the right to deny prospective purchasers of land intended for the “aligned community” and on what basis. He did not respond.</p> <p>According to its website, New Founding seeks to “build and back companies defined by American ideals and a positive national vision”, that it “explicitly oppose[s] DEI/ESG and the bureaucratization of American business culture” and targets “customers disfavored by corrosive ideologies”.</p> <p>New Founding is currently giving HRP top billing on its website and is described as a “real estate project developing aligned communities in Appalachia”.</p> <p>Kentucky Ridgerunner, meanwhile, is an LLC founded in 2022 with Abbotoy at its head according to Kentucky company records. It is the main vehicle for HRP, and owns the bulk of the land which is up for sale to buyers with rightwing sympathies.</p> <p>Abbotoy’s father, Mark, a real estate appraiser based in Hartsville, Tennessee, is named as managing partner on the <a href=\"https://archive.ph/uUJzq\">Ridgerunner website</a>, and Lazar Lazarovski, a Nashville-based tech entrepreneur and realtor, is marketing director.</p> <p>The website currently advertises two developments in the vicinity of Burkesville, a town in the so-called Eastern Pennyroyal district of southern Kentucky, around 20 miles north of the Tennessee border.</p> <p>One of the developments, christened “Longhollow Acres”, is described as “a rolling 550-acre farm situated six miles northeast of Burkesville, and about half a mile to the river”.</p> <p>The offering on the website comprises 17 lots, mostly 3-5 acres with four premium lots of between around 93 and 126 acres. Smaller lots start at $39,900, and the largest premium lot, which prospective buyers can inspect by way of drone footage,has an asking price of $399,000, according to the advertisement on Kentucky Ridgerunner’s website.</p> <p>The other development “the Bend at the Cumberland River”, Ridgerunner touts as having “prime building sites with views down to the Cumberland River that can be cleared (or maintained in forest) as you desire”.</p> <p>It is comprised mostly of smaller lots between half and three quarters of an acre, with a few larger uncleared lots advertised as “forest/prairie” properties. Most of these are priced at $45,000, with some outliers as low as $35,000 and three “premium view” lots advertised for $50,000-$60,000.</p> <p>Using satellite imagery, maps, and property records, The Guardian was able to identify the location, purchase details, and the potential profits that Kentucky Ridgerunner and Abbotoy will realise from the two tracts of land that have been subdivided for sale.</p> <p>“Longhollow Acres” is located in the hilly northeast of Cumberland County. Kentucky Ridgerunner purchased a 460 acre tract for $900,000 from a previous owner in September 2022, which was the third highest price paid for a farm tract since 2021 in a thirty mile radius, according to county property records.</p> <p>A comparison between satellite imagery and the advertisements on the Ridge Runner website appear to indicate that some of the land being offered has been subdivided from a neighboring property with different owners.</p> <p>The Guardian sought to confirm the separate ownership of some of the offering in the email to Abbotoy and by calling the owner of the neighboring property. Abbotoy did not respond to the request and the neighborhood property owner did not respond to a message left with another member of their household.</p> <p>The “Bend” property is located around sixteen miles southwest of that property, downstream on the Cumberland River, just inside neighboring Monroe county. There, Kentucky Ridgerunner paid almost $1.03m n to a pastoral land company for 170 acres. Monroe county property records indicate that the property was subdivided into roughly two equal halves, and the eastern half was further subdivided to include the 50 small lots being offered for sale.</p> <p>The pricing of lots on both developments appears to lock in significant profits for the joint venture if the land sells at asking price.</p> <p>At the Bend development, where one half of the land’s original 170-acre, $1.03m lot will be divided into 50 small lots, the sellers will collect $2.05m if buyers meet the asking prices currently on the website. By comparing county land records to pricing on the Ridgerunner website, the Guardian determined that while the company paid around $6,011 an acre, buyers will pay up to the equivalent of $88,500 an acre for an unimproved lot, or up to fourteen times the rate HRP paid.</p> <p>At the Longhollow development, sellers will collect a total of at least $2.27m on 550 acres of land they paid $900,000 for 460 acres of (one parcel which is under contract no longer displays the asking price). Kentucky Ridge Runner paid just over $1950 an acre; asking prices are up to $10,327.30 an acre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/24/christian-nationalist-patriot-groups-2024-presidential-election\">‘You better pray’: Christian nationalist groups are mobilizing before the 2024 elections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Officials at Monroe county’s assessor’s office, county clerk’s office and chief judge’s office all said that there is no zoning or permitting required for land development in the county, and therefore developers pay none of the costs associated with those processes in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>The Cumberland county clerk, Bryan Morgan, said that the county similarly did not require or charge for zoning or permitting.</p> <p>Financial matters aside, Stewart said the move tracked with the preferences of the contemporary far right.</p> <p>“This is typical of the far-right’s emotional need for a ‘safe space’,” she wrote.</p> <p>“It’s not just that<strong> </strong>some members of this extremist cohort disagree<strong> </strong>with liberals, feminists, or any number of people who don’t share their views; it’s that they really can’t stand having those people anywhere nearby,” Stewart added.</p> <p>“The mere existence of people not like them counts as an insult.”</p>",

I’m bisexual, or maybe the more correct term is pansexual – I don’t really see gender as&nbsp;a dividing line for who I’m attracted to. Growing up, I was ostracised for it, so I always masked my behaviour, and&nbsp;it wasn’t until my mid-20s that I&nbsp;started to think: hold on, I can’t just keep faking who I am.</p> <p>By the time I met Kasey four years ago, I had been through enough to feel comfortable in myself. But sometimes I still have intrusive thoughts, like this school tutor in my head saying: “What you’re doing is wrong.” Kasey is also bisexual – being able to have someone that you love and trust in your corner helps you figure these things out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We will usually start with cuddling on the couch, kissing and we’ll move to oral and grinding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I now see that many things that I&nbsp;hadn’t thought of before can constitute sex. One of our favourite things to do is outercourse. We will usually start with cuddling on the couch, kissing and then move to oral and grinding. </p> <p>For us, sex means starting from a&nbsp;place of intimacy and touch and, depending on how we’re both feeling, we’ll decide whether we want to have penetrative sex, or if we just want to edge and stop just before we orgasm, and be close to each other for 40 minutes. Kasey is on antidepressants, so it is hard for her to get off, and there are times when we’ll be having sex and&nbsp;we know it’s not going to happen. So, we’ll go to bed and lie in each other’s arms. It’s frustrating sometimes for her, but it’s normal if it doesn’t happen.</p> <p>Over time, I have started to want to&nbsp;cross-dress and present as more feminine. I was really self-conscious about it – I’m a fairly burly guy. But Kasey pointed out how great my legs looked in tights and other such nice things, so I now feel much better about it. In the same way, she has cut her hair and is presenting a lot more masculine, and she is still so attractive to me.</p> <p>I want to continue exploring this part of ourselves. Sometimes I still get these nagging thoughts as a hangover from my childhood that there’s something wrong with what I’m doing. But it just takes time. <br></p> <h2>Kasey, 27</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don’t go through the motions assuming that we’re going to have heterosexual penetrative sex</p> </blockquote> <p>Since we’ve been together, we have always been open with each other about not wanting to play the normal gender game. Jacob sometimes wants to be able to be more feminine. I have historically identified as agender but I’m moving toward identifying as trans masculine. I remember going to Pride during the first year of our relationship. Jacob wore my clothes and I wore some of his.</p> <p>Still, when we first started dating, sex felt very performative. I think a big reason for that is that we were having the kind of sex they tell you about in school, where you have foreplay, then you have penetrative sex, and then the guy comes. We’d both internalised the cis attitude that sex means penetration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Jacob can usually come pretty fast, which I’m very jealous of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As we’ve been more open about gender, we’ve had less penetrative sex and are less guided by the fact that he has a penis and I have a vagina. We don’t go through the motions assuming that we’re going to have heterosexual penetrative sex, and talking about our feelings of gender has helped us to not feel guilty about what kind of sex we “should” be having. Though we both had radically different backgrounds in terms of how we were told about sex as teenagers (I&nbsp;went to more of a hippy school), we’d&nbsp;both internalised societal norms.</p> <p>I’m now on medication for my mental health, which makes it really tricky for me to orgasm, and penetrative sex can be uncomfortable. Jacob usually comes pretty fast, which I’m very jealous of. It’s frustrating to not be able&nbsp;to enjoy sex like I used to before I&nbsp;started this medication. But now we do a lot more foreplay like grinding and just lying together naked and touching each other. </p> <p>We have sex one to three times a week. It’s more just a time for us to be together, to talk, to cuddle. We both want to explore more gender play, and I feel as though we have a foundation to do that.</p>",

It attracted guest stars such as Neil Kinnock and Jon Snow and up-and-coming actors including Andrew Lincoln, Hermione Norris, Gina McKee and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/24/daniel-craigs-20-best-film-performances-ranked\">Daniel Craig</a>. Now, the entire surviving cast (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/18/david-swift-obituary\">Swift died in 2016</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/oct/20/haydn-gwynne-obituary\">Gwynne in 2023</a>) has reunited for a touring stage show, Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening!, which drops the GlobeLink diaspora into a news landscape that makes the 1990s skulduggery seem almost sweet.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Andy Hamilton (co-creator and co-writer)</strong> From ’77 onwards Guy and I were working on the same shows: [Radio 4 satire] Week Ending, [and TV sketch shows] Not the Nine O’Clock News and Who Dares Wins. Because we’d had experience of doing sketches the night before transmission we thought: could you do that with a sitcom? Then we thought we could make it a newsroom.</p> <p><strong>Guy Jenkin (co-creator and co-writer)</strong><strong> </strong>We’d made our living by being funny on the clock. And the newsroom gives you constant moral dilemmas in a way that not many offices do. We originally took it to the BBC but three months later they hadn’t read it.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> We sent it to Channel 4. BBC News let us sit in for one day. There was a very hard-working editor with a very cool assistant. At about 20 to six the assistant said: “Someone’s been shot in Belfast.” And the editor said, “Well is he dead? If he’s dead, he’s in.” That’s the tone we wanted. The original title was Dead Belgians Don’t Count. Channel 4 said no [to that title].</p> <p><strong>Jenkin</strong> It wasn’t good for sales in Belgium.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> Journalists wrote about what the title Drop the Dead Donkey meant but the truth is we made it up. We thought, what’s something that might be shouted out at the last minute? Maybe a story about a dead donkey is the thing you drop. And it’s alliterative.</p> <p><strong>Neil Pearson (Dave Charnley)</strong> It was a very different template to the usual UK sitcom. It was much more US in that it was ensemble-based. The UK format was a leading couple, the couple next door and a sofa. This was a working environment, like Taxi or Cheers.</p> <p><strong>Jenkin</strong> And it stayed as an ensemble. Nobody emerged as the star within it.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Tompkinson (Damien Day)</strong> It was lovely for the actors because it was so script-driven. We always knew that Andy and Guy were the stars.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> They all had a good body of work behind them but weren’t well known faces. David Swift had been an agent and he’d represented John Pilger so he knew that world.</p> <p><strong>Victoria Wicks (Sally Smedley)</strong> David and I would be told off quite a lot for mucking around. It was a really special relationship.</p> <p><strong>Jeff Rawle (George Dent)</strong> I’d decided I was going to spend my whole time writing and wasn’t looking for acting work but I went to the audition and realised it was really, really funny.</p> <p><strong>Susannah Doyle (Joy Merryweather)</strong> I wasn’t in season one. They wanted a very divisive character to be the messenger of doom: dump chaos and leave. Everyone is terrified of Joy. She gets jobs because people are scared of her.</p> <p><strong>Robert Duncan (Gus Hedges)</strong> My new agent said, “There’s this character who is an absolute rogue. He would shop his own granny. I really think that’s you.” I’d only known my agent for two months!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"463e05ca4ed0c03455e8668dd74f53bdf07513c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/463e05ca4ed0c03455e8668dd74f53bdf07513c3/0_74_1977_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"874\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hard pressed … (clockwise from left) David Swift, Jeff Rawle, Stephen Tomkinson, Susannah Doyle, Neil Pearson, Robert Duncan, Victoria Wicks and Ingrid Lacey in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hat Trick/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> Gus was always trying to drive them down to the lowest common denominator – a grim portent of what was to come. We’d get faxes from people in offices of bits of management gobbledegook they’d just heard.</p> <p><strong>Tompkinson</strong> People were constantly guessing who the on-screen performers were based on. Because Sally had the initials SS they thought it was [British newsreader] Selina Scott. But it was never specific.</p> <p><strong>Wicks</strong> I’m not based on Jon Snow.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> The Channel 4 lawyer said: “It’s very important that you say nobody is based on anybody.” And I said, “Well, nobody <em>is</em> based on anybody.” And he said, “Yes, just like that.” And I said, “No, really!” Roysten Merchant was an abstract corporate monster.</p> <p><strong>Jenkin</strong> It was helpful that Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell both had the same initials [to avoid either suing].</p> <p><strong>Pearson</strong> Journalists were bizarrely keen to claim credit for the basis for these frankly disgusting people.</p> <p><strong>Tompkinson</strong> I was touring a play and being invited into lots of regional BBC radio stations and all of them said: “We think we know who Damien’s based on. He’s in this office.” So the people we were parodying were really flattered and more than prepared to give us information and stories that we could use in the show.</p> <p><strong>Doyle</strong> Politicians desperately wanted to be in it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/13/how-we-made-drop-the-dead-donkey-andy-hamilton-robert-duncan\">How we made Drop the Dead Donkey</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Hamilton </strong>Neil Kinnock had lost unexpectedly to John Major. Everybody was saying he was a broken man. But he was very funny and gracious. We had drinks in the bar afterwards and my dad, who was a working-class Tory, started to explain to Neil Kinnock why he had lost the election. I was mortified. I thought he handled himself beautifully.</p> <p><strong>Tompkinson</strong> You’re always shown a finished product on the news and this was the first programme to lift the lid. It definitely made me more cynical. You started thinking, “I wonder how they got to there …”</p> <p><strong>Rawle</strong> This had a very different feel to other sitcoms I’d been in. It felt like it was going to be an important comedy.</p> <p><strong>Pearson</strong> The pilot was an exercise in fear.</p> <p><strong>Tompkinson</strong> Parliament wasn’t sitting at the time and not a great deal seemed to be happening. And then, when we were doing it for real, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Suddenly there was news everywhere. It sounds quite sick but we were very fortunate.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> The scripts were written and rewritten but there were holes in them: Topical Dialogue A, Topical Dialogue B …</p> <p><strong>Pearson</strong> We’d start on Friday with a 22-minute script for a 28-minute slot. Work Friday, Saturday. Monday, we’d put in tentative topicals. Then that would be refined through to Thursday when we recorded. On Friday the show would go out at 10pm so they would edit all day and two of us would do a voiceover over the end credits to mop up any stories that had broken that day.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> With the very late stuff they didn’t have time to learn the dialogue so they would stick it on Post-It notes on their screens and newspapers. The set was wonderfully cluttered.</p>    <p><strong>Duncan</strong> Gus’s narrative one week was “A tidy office is a tidy mind”, so I breezed through picking up Post-It notes and I wondered why David was following me around: “You’re taking my bloody lines!”</p> <p><strong>Ingrid Lacey (Helen Cooper)</strong> It’s really quite frightening to have chunks of dialogue that you’re learning in your lunch hour while you’re having a costume fitting. I would watch the news the night before and think, “Please God, don’t let a story break.”</p> <p><strong>Wicks</strong> Like news tycoons falling off boats.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> Robert Maxwell fell off his boat at a very inconvenient time. We had a running joke about him and we had to fillet that. We would start recording at a quarter to eight and sometimes we’d be in the bar by nine. There was always a cracking atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>Lacey</strong> I had a line that was “Tony Blair and Ceausescu”. And it kept coming out “Tony Benn and Chichester”. I remember saying to the audience: “I hope you’ve brought sleeping bags; we might be here all night.”</p> <p><strong>Rawle</strong> I attacked Daniel Craig with a toasting fork. It’s my only claim to fame. I made him stand on one leg and do the birdie dance for abducting my daughter. He always says: “Jeff, if it wasn’t for that scene where would I be now?”</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> It was very big for Channel 4. [Chief executive] Michael Grade insisted on moving us to 10 o’clock. And we said definitively: “No Michael, that’s a terrible idea, our audience will be watching the news.” And the figures shot up. He was proved right, absolutely.</p> <p><strong>Jenkin</strong> Because all the actors went off to do other things it got harder to get them all together. We felt that we’d gone as far as we could with the characters and said what we wanted to say. You want to go out on a high.</p> <p><strong>Pearson</strong> I don’t think anybody wanted to do the show with 60% of the cast and have to explain that some combine harvester accident had wiped out three of them. We decided we would finish all together rather than limp on.</p> <p><strong>Duncan</strong> The final scene was shot. I’m in deep, deep depression – mentally flummoxed. And then Steve comes in dressed up as a pantomime donkey!</p> <p><strong>Tompkinson</strong> It was a great time to stop because then news became 24/7. GlobeLink was never that. The technology overtook what the show was.</p> <p><strong>Rawle</strong> Michael Grade said at one point: “I’m thinking of doing this every evening.” And the writers were like: “Fuck! It’s hard enough doing it once a week.”</p> <p><strong>Pearson</strong> Now here we are, doing it every evening [on stage].</p> <p><strong>Duncan</strong> Yes, he’s got his way.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> The stage show is going to open with a clip from 1990 before we discover those characters being parachuted into the modern media madness. You’ll have a vivid graphic example of what’s changed.</p> <p><strong>Jenkin</strong> There are news channels that make no effort to tell the truth but those that do have a great deal of difficulty working out what is the truth. And a lot of audiences don’t believe there <em>is </em>a truth anymore. It’s strange to think that GlobeLink News, which in its day was outrageous, immoral and shambolic, now looks like the height of professionalism and good taste.</p> <p><strong>Hamilton</strong> It feels like we’ve reached an event horizon with the relationship between news and democracy. And that cast has remained very close, so we thought wouldn’t it be great to get them all out again?</p> <p><strong>Tompkinson</strong> We’re still feeling Haydn’s loss every day. It seems very cruel and unfair. She’s going to inspire us to do the best that we possibly can.</p> <p><strong>Duncan</strong> The first read-through was moving. I thought: “We haven’t done this for 25 years but everything is there: all the little traits, the voices.”</p> <p><strong>Rawle</strong> It’s like walking back in time. It’s very rare in life that you get a second crack at something you loved so much.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/drop-the-dead-donkey/richmond-theatre/\">Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening! is at Richmond theatre, London, 31 January to 3 February; touring to 22&nbsp;June.</a></em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>At the centre of this week’s mega-poll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/15/yougov-poll-telegraph-tories-disaster-analysis\">that projected</a> an election wipeout for the Conservatives there lurked both a mystery and a statement of the obvious. Who was behind it? No one seemed to know. But what do they want? Seemingly, a change from Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>It is a sign of Sunak’s plight that the poll – fronted by a Tory peer and explicitly framed as showing the prime minister’s policies are leading the party into doom – was not even the greatest act of disloyalty in a week when 60 backbenchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/16/tory-deputy-chairs-resign-lee-anderson-brendan-clarke-smith-rishi-sunak\">voted to amend</a> his flagship migration policy.</p> <p>That said, the YouGov survey of 14,000 voters, extrapolated to constituencies to give the headline finding of a post-election Conservative party reduced to 169 MPs, was arguably even more ominous for Sunak, for a series of reasons.</p> <p>Firstly is the fact that he appears to face a new and thus far anonymous opponent. While the polling, set out in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/01/14/general-election-poll-tories-worst-defeat-1997-labour/\">Monday’s Daily Telegraph</a>, was presented by Lord Frost, the estimated £70,000 cost was covered by the Conservative Britain Alliance, a previously unknown organisation described only as a “group of Conservative donors”.</p> <p>The organisation, if that is what it is, has no web presence, and no register as a company, charity or electoral entity. Those rumoured to be behind it who have insisted they are not include Paul Marshall, the hedge fund manager behind GB News, and a series of other figures in the rightwing Tory firmament. A spokesperson for Marshall denied he had paid for the poll and said he had never previously heard of the alliance.</p> <p>Under British Polling Council guidelines, all polls have to say who commissioned them. However, this needs only a name to be contacted – in this case David Frost – and does not need to specify who paid for the work.</p> <p>In place of facts have swirled various rumours, including the idea that the backers are working on behalf of ministers or former ministers who want to replace Sunak, whether before the election or, more likely, in its wake.</p> <p>The agenda of those behind the poll was clear. Both the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/01/14/reform-uk-richard-tice-rishi-sunak-tories-general-election/\">Telegraph</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/01/14/david-frost-election-poll-tories-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer/\">Frost</a> argued in Monday’s paper that the answer was to focus squarely on the concerns of Tory voters minded to defect to Reform UK, with the former arguing that this could mean the difference between a landslide loss and a hung parliament.</p> <p>While this prescription was arguable – YouGov took the unusual step of adding a note to its <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/48371-yougov-mrp-shows-labour-would-win-1997-style-landslide-if-election-were-held-today\">explanation of the poll</a> rubbishing it – such manoeuvrings are deeply unwelcome to Sunak and his team, with senior No 10 officials known to be furious.</p> <p>On Monday evening, a clearly exasperated Isaac Levido, the Australian political strategist who is Sunak’s campaign director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/15/get-serious-sunaks-campaign-director-tells-tories-they-can-win\">told a meeting of Tory backbenchers</a> that it was time to “get serious” if they actually wanted to win the election. “Let me be clear: divided parties fail,” he warned them.</p> <p>What does it all mean? As ever it depends who you ask. Tim Bale, the professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, and a close observer of the Conservatives, said it appeared to be a salvo by a faction loyal to the small-state wing of the party.</p> <p>“Clearly, there is some sort of concerted plan by someone to get rid of Rishi Sunak. It’s not simply about wanting to push the Conservative party in a certain direction, they’ve got so desperate they might want to precipitate a leadership challenge,” he said.</p> <p>Whether this would succeed was another matter, Bale said: “I think most Conservative MPs are persuaded of the fact that they would make themselves a laughing stock if they went through all that again. And also, there’s no one sensible waiting in the wings who would want to do it.”</p> <p>Among the few Conservatives who are public in their desire to replace Sunak is David Campbell Bannerman, the former MEP who coheads the Boris Johnson-friendly Conservative Democratic Organisation.</p> <p>“Sunak staying on will just guarantee we’re out of power for 10 years if not more. If you lose on the scale that these polls suggest, down to 160 MPs, it’s a hell of a cliff to climb,” he said.</p> <p>“My view is that Starmer is beatable with the right policies and the right leader, or at least we’ll have a respectable showing. Currently, Conservative voters are on strike, are not coming out, and under Sunak they won’t come back.”</p> <p>In contrast, one Tory backbencher usually loyal to Sunak simply rolled their eyes when asked about the poll. “It was probably people who wanted a return of Boris Johnson, but frankly it’s just very unhelpful,” they said.</p> <p>It did, however, have some uses, they added: “It’s clear that a plurality of people in the country are more to the right on immigration than we are and we would do well to remember that.”</p> <p>One thing all sections of the party appeared united on was an insistence that they have no idea who is behind the Conservative Britain Alliance.</p> <p>“I don’t know who they are. I hadn’t come across them before,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former cabinet minister. “When a poll comes out that shows, seat by seat, that your party is not doing well then you are obviously interested in that.”</p> <p>While Rees-Mogg is a sometime critic of Sunak, he said that if the mystery poll backers did seek a change of prime minister, he would not support this: “I see no point in destabilising the leadership of your own party this close to the election. I just don’t think it makes any sense.”</p>",

She outclassed Iga Świątek, the world No 1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open, her deepest run in any grand slam.</p> \n<p>“I knew it’s going to be an amazing match,” she said. “I don’t really think it would end up like this but I’m just glad to make it through another round.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2024/jan/20/alcaraz-swiatek-and-zverev-in-action-on-day-seven-australian-open-live\">Swiatek stunned by Noskova, Zverev, Medvedev and Alcaraz through: Australian Open – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At 19, Nosková is the highest ranked player of the rising wave of Czech youngsters and one of the best teenagers in the world. Having crept as high as world No 40 last year and now ranked 50, it was only a matter of time before she delivered a big win.</p> \n<p>While Świątek was the tournament favourite, her extremely difficult path through the draw had underlined her vulnerabilities. Two days earlier, Danielle Collins led Świątek by 4-1 and a double break before the Pole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/18/fight-till-the-end-iga-swiatek-roars-back-to-defeat-danielle-collins-in-australian-open-epic\" title=\"\">reeled off five games in a row to survive</a>. While Świątek performed exceptionally to pull herself back from the brink of defeat, her struggles evidently shattered any illusions she was untouchable in Melbourne.</p> \n<p>Nosková stepped on to the court fully aware she had more than enough power and weight of shot to frustrate Świątek, who tends to be most vulnerable to bigger hitters who can take time away from her and force her behind the baseline.</p> \n<p>A smooth, powerful ball-striker with a spectacular backhand, Nosková constantly looked to work herself inside the baseline and dominate the exchanges. After narrowly losing a tight, competitive opening set, she settled into the match and began to swing freely as she took control.</p> \n<p>She slammed down 35 winners and served brilliantly, no more so than when 0-30 down in the final game. Nosková gritted her teeth and roared back to seal an incredible victory with a serve that was unreturnable. She then flopped down in her seat and covered her face with a towel, overwhelmed by what she had achieved.</p> \n<p>In her short career, she had pulled off three wins over top-10 player before this triumph. At grand slams, though, while she had pushed prominent players and shown that she was close, Nosková still awaited her first top-50 win and had never reached the third round of a grand slam. Now she has beaten the best in the world and positioned herself to battle for even more.</p> \n<p>“I know my game,” she said. “I know that I have improved a lot in the last year and a half. I just believed my game tonight. I really wanted this win. I took it very seriously.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the aftermath of a frustrating defeat, Świątek remained level-headed as she explained her emotions.

I&nbsp;mean, how hard can it be, teaching year 2? And the day ends at 3.15pm, right? Perhaps I’ll get an evening job as well …</p> <p><em>Bang! Ouch! Flying board rubber hits me on the jaw.</em></p> <p>To be fair, my missus – Miss Honour – does put in the hours. Sometimes she’s out of the house before the rest of us are up, and not back until 12 hours later, exhausted. Of course she talks about it, but, like many people, I&nbsp;still don’t really know exactly what my partner does all day.</p> <p>She works at a large primary school in north-west London. It has its challenges, like the fact that English isn’t the first language of more than 80% of the children. But Ofsted says it’s a good school.</p> <p>I say Ofsted is wrong: it’s a bloody brilliant school. Not only does my partner work there, but our kids go there. Our family – apart from this member, who rarely gets beyond the gate – has spent about 17 happy years there in total. Now I get to see, and feel, its beating heart. After a grilling by the headteacher and the trust (it’s an academy), I’ve somehow been given permission to take 2H for a day towards the end of term. Not totally unaccompanied; that would be ridiculous. So poor Miss&nbsp;Honour doesn’t even get a day off.</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong><strong> 7.30am</strong><br>Now I understand those early starts. There’s so much to do: preparation and sorting – books, materials, whiteboards, pencils. It feels strange being in a classroom again; I often dream about it, but I’m always sitting on the children’s side, not standing up at the front.</p> <p>We’ve spent a lot of the weekend going through the plan for the day, but suddenly it’s all a bit fuzzy. A late change of schedule (there wasn’t going to be an assembly, but now there is) has thrown me. I can hear them, 30&nbsp;excited seven-year-olds, lining up outside. Well, probably not lining up. Miss Honour says I need to sort them out. Help!</p> <p><strong>8.40am</strong><br>They pour through the door, an irresistible tsunami of hope for the future. My fear disappears (for now) and my plan not to smile until lunch goes out of the window. So many questions for me: am I Miss Honour’s husband? Am I a teacher? Do I have any brothers and sisters? (Answers: Kinda. Just for the day. One of each.) Now go and put your things away, and come and sit on the carpet.</p> <p>“Good morning, 2H!”</p> <p>“Good morning, Mr Wollaston! Good morning, everyone!”</p> <p>Mr Wollaston – I like it. My innate authority is clearly shining through and they respect me. Now they’re sitting quietly, doing the warm-up maths I’ve put on the board on their own little whiteboards. See? There’s very little to it …</p> <p>Er, I might want to get on with the register, says Miss&nbsp;Honour from the back of the room, assembly starts in five minutes. Ah yes, good idea, the register: Adam, Rawan, Mariam, Yasir, Luna, Yossef … Everyone’s in today. My lessons, it seems, are very well attended.</p>    <p><strong>10am</strong><br>We survived assembly: in the main hall, the assistant head read a book called My Shadow Is Pink, which touches on ideas of gender identity, diversity and acceptance – I don’t remember any of that at my primary school. Then back to class for a bit of English.</p> <p>We look at some contractions: do not = don’t; could have = could’ve; will not = won’t, etc. No problem with any of that, but I struggle with the operation of the interactive whiteboard: keep getting the wrong&nbsp;screen up or making it disappear altogether. Kinan, in the front row, helpfully appoints himself my&nbsp;technical assistant.</p> <p>I wonder if my aura of total control and authority may be slipping. Now we’re looking at the book they’re doing in class, Gregory Cool. They fill me in on the story so far: Gregory, a city kid, goes to visit his grandparents in Tobago. It’s too hot, the food is too spicy, there are no video games, Gregory’s cousin doesn’t have any shoes, there’s a shark at the beach, except it’s really a dolphin&nbsp;…</p> <p>Whoa, one at a time, and don’t just shout out, put your hands up, please! Can you “go toilet”? Can it wait till break? Go on then. You too? Really? When do I get to go toilet, I wonder …</p> <p>It gets worse, though, because next it’s role play. I divide the class into groups of four to pick a favourite scene from the book and act it out. They nearly all pick the beach scene, obviously, and soon there are six sharks/dolphins cruising between the tables, terrorising screaming children. Now they’re coming for me; they can smell my fear. Less <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/gregory-cool/caroline-binch/9781847802583\">Gregory Cool</a>, more Sharknado 3D, at full volume. I’m worried it’s disturbing other classes … Can the headteacher hear the racket down the corridor? Sacked before break – has that ever happened?</p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong><br>Phew, breaktime. And Miss Honour reminds me of some of the classroom management techniques we talked about before: a raised hand, a stern look, a countdown from five, a shake of the tambourine. Also dojo points (gold stars in old money). By the end of the day, I’ll be handing out dojos like it’s Christmas.</p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong><br>They’re back, on the carpet, a couple of dojo points awarded, a semblance of order restored. We’re doing maths now, and shopping change. So, you buy an apple for 23p, pay with £1, how much change should you get? I’m using the number line method to find the difference: so from 23 to the next 10 number, 30, how many is that? Seven? Right. And from 30 to 100? Ten, 20, 30 … 70 – 70&nbsp;and&nbsp;seven … 77p, yay!</p> <p>Then it’s back to the tables to work through more examples in pairs, using plastic money if required, while I wander between them. It’s now that it happens, with one pair who haven’t quite got it. We do another number line – they’re almost there – and another, and they get it. Something they didn’t know and couldn’t do, now they do and can. I’ve played some part in that – actual teaching – and it feels amazing, makes up for everything else. Well, almost …</p> <p>Meanwhile, 28 other children are not being attended to, some of whom have already finished; others who don’t get it. Along with classroom management, it’s one of the things that strikes me as being really hard: how to spread yourself out and give enough attention to 30 children with mixed abilities. There is a teaching assistant, Max, in the class, but he’s full-time with a student with special educational needs. I’m not getting any help from Miss Honour, who’s just looking on, critically.</p> <p><strong>Noon</strong><br>Lunchtime, finally! Maybe we’ll get takeaway sushi, and go to the staff room for a gossip and a moan, and to talk about when we’re next going on strike or what we’re going to do on our incredibly long holidays … Just kidding. I know: there’s more preparation, so we’ll bolt down our sandwiches and get on with it. Oh&nbsp;God, and there’s sewing this afternoon …</p>    <p><strong>2.15pm</strong><br>The sewing is obviously chaos. They’re doing wall hangings: seascapes inspired by a painting called The Turtle Pound by Winslow Homer. They’ve almost finished: all that has to be done is to sew in wooden dowels along the top edge and attach strings so they can be hung. It probably doesn’t help that, while demonstrating, I’m holding this particular wall hanging upside down, sewing my dowel into the bottom edge, which amuses everyone, including Miss Honour. OK, OK, so it’s a diving turtle, all right?</p> <p>Running stitch, no problem, in and out, but needles are tricky – not just sharp, but quite hard to find when lost. Again, we have the different-ability issue – some have finished; others are still on needle-threading – and I’m spread pretty thinly, and not especially useful even when I am there. There hasn’t been an awful lot of teaching going on this afternoon, I’m afraid, and there will be – literally – a whole load of loose ends to tie up.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong><br>Somehow we’ve made it through the day. It’s just tidying up now, while singing the tidying-up song. Kinan has taken over the job of dojo distribution full‑time, and seems to be handing them out by the dozen, to everyone. You know what, that’s fine, I think they’ve earned them.</p> <p>To 2H: you’re a lovely class, thank you for your patience, and your help. And I apologise for the small hole in your education – I hope it can be filled.</p> <p>To the profession: what you do is incredible, probably the most important job of all. Of course everyone knows that already (apart from the government – a 6.5% rise is still below inflation; you don’t need a number line to work that out). My tiny glimpse into your working world has only left me more in awe of you. Including you, Miss&nbsp;Honour.</p> <p>She’s not going home now, at 3.15pm. She has a meeting with a parent, then a school one. There’s marking to be done, including the marking I should be doing, and more preparation, those loose ends to be tied up (including the literal ones). I haven’t really done her job for a day, more like half a day, because I didn’t do any of that, or planning, or report-writing. I’m knackered, though – physically, mentally, emotionally – and I’m going on strike. Well, home for a lie-down, then maybe a little light journalism. Miss Honour used to be a journalist, as it happens. There is some crossover, I guess – talking to people, finding things out, trying to get things across. My day job comes with less responsibility, though, is less performative and less full-on exhausting. Plus I get to go toilet when I&nbsp;want and need to.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong><strong> 8.40am</strong><br>Back to school, but in my usual capacity as a parent, dropping off. On the way I get a “Good morning, Mr Wollaston.” Aw! It wasn’t a dream – someone remembers, and the respect lives on. Then, on duty at the gate, the assistant head (who, if I’m honest, I’m&nbsp;usually a bit scared of) is smiling. She’s probably going to congratulate and thank me, maybe even offer me a job. “I hear you didn’t even do your marking,” she says. “Lightweight.”</p> <h2><strong>‘</strong><strong>What I have learned is that I&nbsp;don’t have any taste at all’: Joel Golby</strong><strong> tries eBay trading</strong></h2> <p>My girlfriend is a lifestyle and music influencer who hoards trinkets like Smaug hoards gold. This was fine until the first Covid lockdown, when her day-to-day work dried up (no gigs to go to, no brands to work with) and there was nothing left to do but compulsively go on eBay. Parcels kept turning up wrapped in sticky tape and stuffed with bubble wrap. Trinkets started to cover every available surface, and then sit on top of each other like sedimentary layers. One day, I walked into the front room and said, “Do we really need a toast rack in the shape of women’s legs when we never make toast and certainly never put it in a toast rack? Do we need this many small ceramic versions of cowboy boots? Why do we have so many teapots?” And she said, “Fine, I’ll start a shop.” This means there are even more trinkets in my house; just now they go under the guise of “stock”.</p> <p>So the first thing I have to do when I spend a day doing her job is … buy a trinket. Every time we walk past a cluttered-looking charity shop or sprawling secondhand furniture store, we go in and look through all the shelves in silence, and what I have learned from my many attempts to point out a trinket she might want to buy on these expeditions is that I don’t have any taste at all. Every ashtray or side plate or vintage mug that prompts me to say, “That might be nice?” is met with a&nbsp;firm but fair head shake. I just cannot tell what makes one plate with a lobster on it ugly and another plate with a&nbsp;lobster on it chic. How can anyone?</p> <p>Anyway, we go on to eBay, and after clattering in a few “trending search terms” (“How do you know they’re trending?”; “I know if I’ve noticed them”) into the machine, we settle on a … well, I don’t really know what it is, actually. A sort of ashtray? But not. It’s shaped like a cowboy hat with a pistol on top, and the brim could take some ash, I&nbsp;suppose, but you could also use it as a small tray for, like, bits. A few days later it turns up in the post and … yeah, I still don’t really know what it is. But it has a bit of a vibe to it.</p>    <p>What I learn about running a small business is that it’s so much more tedious than I thought. I kind of figured I’d buy a few fun vases and that would be it. (What’s finer than looking at eBay for ages! What’s better than spending money!) But the piecemeal jobs it takes to actually <em>sell</em> the thing take up hours.</p> <p>First, you unwrap the ashtray/hat thing, then you have to take a nicely lit, nicely composed photo of it. We have a special plinth in the house that is used to arrange trinkets on, but to create a backdrop for the photo you have to go upstairs and tie a sheet to the balcony and have it flop down just right behind it, which takes more tweaking, bending and knot-tying than I’d like.</p> <p>Then you actually have to take the photo, which requires a few attempts (held in an agonising squat position), then swap in the next trinket, then the next, then the next one, then the next. If it’s a gloomy day, you might have to set up some lighting. You have to upload all the photos to Instagram and write a cheerful caption for each one – “Cowboy sort of ashtray thing! Quite vibey?” – and figure out a price that makes the whole exercise worth it. You have to have a DM exchange with anyone who wants to buy, as well as people who slightly want to buy, but also want to waste a bit of time, and keep upbeat throughout. You have to issue invoices and wait patiently to get paid.</p> <p>And then the next day you have to wrap up every trinket from the great pile of repurposed packaging we’ve got behind the laundry airer, carefully tape it up tightly, write out the address and triple-check you’ve got it right (Google where they live, just to be nosy), and then, worst of all, go to the post office with a big bag of parcels and queue up for ages before sending them off, one by one by one. It takes for ever, and none of it is fun.</p> <p>Miraculously, my cowboy hat ashtray thing sells, so that’s one less object in the house. But then we get back from standing in a 12-person queue inside a sweltering post office and – yep, there are three more parcels waiting for us at the door. “You know how to package them now – you can help me,” says my girlfriend. Cool, good, great. Really glad I did this.</p> <h2><strong>‘</strong><strong>My mood board is more nightmarish than aspirational’: Coco Khan</strong><strong> tries being a</strong><strong> creative director</strong></h2>    <p>My husband, Stephen, works as a “creative director” in advertising. It’s one of those job titles that if you think about it long enough starts to sound ominous. He directs … creativity? Like some sort of rollneck-wearing art tyrant? An evil twin of Fantasia’s Mickey, pointing at people and things, and commanding them to “be more aspirational!”.</p> <p>When we worked from the same kitchen table during lockdowns, I thought I got a sense of his job. Emails, messaging platforms, call after call. And so, after two years of being in earshot – soaking in the&nbsp;lingo and the processes, and overhearing how he troubleshoots, I was quietly confident in my ability to step into his shoes.</p> <p><strong>Task one: the </strong><strong>mood board</strong><br>Stephen’s job is mostly about working on shoots for brands. Shoots are notoriously expensive endeavours, what with the cost of the crew, kit and location, not to mention the famous face that is usually fronting it (and charging by the minute). It can take months of prep to make sure it delivers exactly what is needed – and deliver it must, because you can’t afford to go back the next day to try again. Because of this, I am not allowed anywhere near an existing shoot. Not even to refill bowls of crisps at the back. But I am given the chance to be a creative wizard by working up ideas for a shoot with a footballer, on the theme of artificial intelligence. I’m told this needs to be represented in a mood board. I jot down some notes about what this exercise should do – give a sense of colour and textures, and objects that convey the aesthetic. It’s all about the feeling, I’m told, so I get to work on my vibes platter, starting by Googling futuristic words: robot; The Matrix; The Jetsons. I download pictures that conjure up AI in an emotional way. But my first attempt goes down like a lead balloon. “The problem with this,” says Stephen, “is that it tells me more about you than the shoot.” It seems what I&nbsp;present is more nightmarish than aspirational; a board where the only mood is bad.</p> <p><strong>Task </strong><strong>two: the edit</strong><br>If there is one thing I know, it’s that I am not a visual person. I learned this in secondary school where my weakest subject was art. I once worked all weekend on a drawing of Geri Halliwell (don’t ask), but when the mark came back I got a D. A D! Apparently it just “looked bad”; my teacher stared at me, bemused, as&nbsp;if to say, “Can you not see it looks <em>messy?”</em> The honest answer was no. That’s when I realised it’s not true that you can do anything you put your mind to. Some people just have a knack.</p> <p>Stephen has the knack when it comes to visuals, I&nbsp;realise, but with editing I have an advantage. Part of his role is looking over video cuts and suggesting improvements. This bit is essentially a storytelling task and, as a writer, I know a thing or two about that. I’m given a rough draft of a video, and pull together an extensive list of narrative tweaks. <em>Get to the explanation quicker. Close</em><em>up o</em><em>f XYZ’s reaction. The last few sentences should be cut, they have little impact. </em>Later, I check to see how many of my suggestions have been taken on. All of them. 100%. Full marks. Just call me Stanley Kubrick.</p>    <p><strong>Task three: </strong><strong>location-scouting</strong><br>For my final task, I’m asked to check out a venue for a video shoot involving a UK rapper. The theme is “retro”, so I head to Flipper’s Roller Boogie Palace, a&nbsp;roller disco in London that is the sister of the original Los Angeles rink, which was described as “Studio 54 on wheels”. Today, the soundtrack is more hip-hop than disco, and I head over on a Friday to check it out. I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for as I walk around. I know that I like the space; that I find it striking. And I know the margaritas look very appealing. (Oh, go on then, better have one, in the name of “research”.)<em> </em>The site manager walks me around, telling me about other shoots that have happened here, and the technical capabilities for sound and light, which I jot down despite not fully understanding the terms.<em> </em>I report back to Stephen’s team, and they agree to do the shoot there. I relay my detailed notes and they seem impressed, until I mention how hard the skates were to put on. “Wait, you went … rollerskating … on a site visit?” Stephen says, looking bemused, much like my art teacher all those years ago. It’s a face that says: “Can you not see this is unprofessional?” I want to make it better, so I offer an explanation: “It was only for a few minutes, just to get a feel. It felt good! Though I had been drinking.” Reader, I only made it worse.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In the craggy hills on the outskirts of the Yemeni capital sits a fortified concrete building encased in a rust-red cage: the British embassy.</p> <p>When commissioning its construction in the early 2000s – the beginning of the “war on terror” – <a href=\"https://archinect.com/designengine/project/british-embassy-sana-a-yemen\">the brief given by the British government</a> to architects called for a design that would serve as a highly secure “bunker” and, at the same time, encourage people to “come in and have a cup of tea”. It was, after all, a building for diplomacy.</p> <p>The safety fears were justified. London’s previous embassy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/14/israel.alqaida\">had been attacked in 2000</a> and western diplomats have been repeatedly targeted since. But whatever the balance between welcoming and secure, the result was the same: for the past two decades, Britain’s envoys have been isolated and therefore under informed. Most critically, the building embodied a widely held view among western governments of Yemen as a security problem above all else.</p>    <p>Now, in 2024, the UK is engaging directly in a fight in Yemen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/14/red-sea-tensions-simmer-as-all-sides-warn-of-possible-further-attacks\">bombing Houthi militants as part of a US-led campaign</a>. Yet, London and Washington have limited information on what is happening on the ground in Yemen, nor do they have a deep understanding of a complex country.</p> <p>Locked away in their embassies and under strict security protocols, western diplomats have for years been cut off from the experience of the relatively small numbers of visitors to Sana’a’s cobble-stoned streets.</p> <p>Even tourists were often able to travel more freely. Although mass tourism never took off in Yemen, a handful of tour agencies offered off-the-beaten-path adventures to the verdant Haraz mountains, famous for fortified castle-style stone villages that cling to and merge with the cliffside, surrounded by Yemeni “mocha” coffee bean crops. Holidaymakers with extra cash would fly to the island of Socotra, known as the Galápagos of the Indian Ocean, where up to a third of the plants and animals are found nowhere else, including the dragon blood tree, named for its crimson sap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/yemen_map/giv-13425SE71XJ5kxvVS/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/yemen_map/giv-13425SE71XJ5kxvVS/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>For a while, Yemen was infamous on travel blogs for “kidnap tourism”, where local tribes would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/mideast/may/22/kidnap.htm\">abduct a hiker or cycling group</a> and ransom them, on the condition the central government built a new school, or fixed a crumbling road. But stories of the tribes’ hospitality, including hosting feasts for their “guests”, meant some particularly daring tourists would deliberately venture into the hills in the hope of being kidnapped.</p> <p>Sana’a, meanwhile, was a secret haven for Arabic students, who travelled from the more familiar study centres in Cairo and Amman (and Damascus before the 2012 civil war) in search of a culture and language less diluted by western influence. On the tip of Arabia – where Arabic is believed to have first emerged – Yemen has been geographically insulated, and the language spoken there remains startlingly classical. The equivalent in the west would be if there were a part of southern Europe where a form of Latin remained alive.</p>    <p>International Arabic language students would rent rooms in Sana’a’s walled old city, <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/385/\">a Unesco world heritage site</a>, where centuries-old buildings built of mud and red-baked brick rise to seven storeys high. These mini, ancient skyscrapers – decorated with geometric patterns and stained glass windows – remain in use today as private homes. Their residents still use the old tricks of these houses, hanging pots of water in alcoves to cool them with flowing air rather than electricity. And unlike much of the rest of the Middle East, public baths remain in use, and it is not unusual to see men in towels holding toothbrushes and shaving razors crossing the street and disappearing through a wooden door into a hammam.</p>    <p>In the souk, women wear all-black niqabs similar to in Saudi Arabia, or the more local style, with a red and green flourish. Many men wear a thawb, a long robe, often in white, and a thick belt decorated with metal filigree with an ornamental jambiya knife front and centre, its hilt traditionally made of horn.</p> <p>Tim MacKintosh-Smith, a British Arabist, travelled to Old Sana’a in the 1980s when he was in his twenties, and was so beguiled he stayed, and was occasionally spotted in his full Yemeni attire.</p> <p>For a while, some international freelance reporters were able to live and work in the country, often working for Yemeni editors running English-language news outlets, such as the Yemen Times and Yemen Observer.</p> <p>The authoritarian president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled from 1990 by making deals and paying off Yemen’s tribal leaders, was in power. He was widely accused of playing up the threat of Islamist militancy in Yemen to get money and support from the US and its allies.</p> <p>Stephen Seche, US ambassador to Yemen from 2007-2010, has previously <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/18/how-the-war-on-terror-failed-yemen/\">described Saleh as an “extraordinary manipulator”</a> who was continuously “sounding the alarm” on al-Qaida.</p> <p>News reporting in English was tolerated by Saleh’s government, especially as the main international story at the time was on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), including one of its members, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/27/gilded-life-of-plane-bomber\">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the “underpants bomber</a>”, who tried to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day in 2009.</p> <p>But to the frustration of Yemenis, their country was increasingly seen through the lens of militancy, a state always on the precipice of becoming “the next Afghanistan”.</p>    <p>In coordination with Saleh’s government, George W Bush started using drones to attack al-Qaida targets in Yemen, a policy Barack Obama expanded, often killing entire families in the process. Donald Trump and Joe Biden have continued the drone strikes.</p> <p>During the early 2010s, British diplomats and military attaches would venture out of their compounds for meetings with Yemeni public figures, which would be held in ornate living rooms with guests sitting on divans for hours chatting and chewing khat leaves, a mild narcotic with a strength somewhere between coffee and cocaine. But after the UK <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7e5169ed915d74e33f1771/Khat-leaflet-NI.pdf\">outlawed khat in 2014</a>, British diplomats were forced to abandon chewing sessions, further isolating themselves from Yemeni life.</p>    <p>Focused on al-Qaida, the west did not pay significant attention to the hardline Shia Houthi insurgency that was raging in northern Yemen. But after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/23/yemen-president-quits\">Saleh was ousted as president during the Arab spring pro-democracy protests in 2011</a> – and severely injured in a bomb attack on his presidential compound – it was the Houthis that took advantage of the ensuing civil war to claim the capital in 2014.</p> <p>A year later, the UK and US evacuated their embassies, leaving themselves even more detached. The civil war forced many Yemeni journalists and academics to leave. Western diplomats have not returned; Arabic language schools have shut down, and tourism has largely vanished.</p> <p>The Romans gave Yemen the name Arabia Felix, or “happy Arabia”, for its rich supplies of myrrh and frankincense, while Yemenis claim the biblical Queen of Sheba was in fact the Queen of Saba, an ancient, pre-Islamic kingdom in the region. Still, in the English-speaking world, Yemen is a country reduced to headlines, which are rarely positive. Yemenis of a certain age living in the UK and the US say that, often, the only example people can think of when the word “Yemen” is mentioned is an episode from the TV series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImN2ze6opHE\">Friends, when Chandler Bing inadvertently gets on a plane there</a> – presumably the writers could not think of anywhere more remote and little known.</p> <p>Yemenis would rather people knew their country for its culture of hospitality, its ancient history and architecture, its food (such a lamb broth Fahsa<em>,</em> topped with fenugreek and cooked in a stone pot over a foot-high gas flame), or at least its people, including the Nobel peace prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/tawakkul-karman-profile\">Tawakkul Karman</a>, known as the “mother of the revolution” after she helped topple Saleh during the 2011 pro-democracy protests.</p>    <p>The Yemeni researcher Nadwa al-Dawsari, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, has written extensively on the failures of western policies towards Yemen, which she says has been viewed “solely through a security lens”.</p> <p>After Biden was elected in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/debate-us-yemen-policy\">al-Dawsari wrote</a> that his administration needed to finally develop a real Yemen policy. “This should start by understanding the local dynamics of the conflict in Yemen by talking directly to Yemenis,” she said.</p> <p>Four years later, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/11/red-sea-shipping-crisis-un-security-council-yemen-youthi-rebels-attacks\">Houthi attacks</a> on shipping lanes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/12/us-uk-houthi-strikes-attack-yemen-visual-guide\">the US and UK are bombing Yemen</a> with new vigour but with even less insight or on-the-ground information on what can and cannot be achieved, or what is at stake from the violence.

            "body" : "<p>They say nothing prepares you. Before&nbsp;having my baby,&nbsp;I&nbsp;approached the&nbsp;literature of motherhood as though I&nbsp;were about to&nbsp;sit an exam. If my studies tempered the shock of birth and early parenthood, then I didn’t notice. The sheer physical and emotive&nbsp;force of&nbsp;the&nbsp;experience left me profoundly shaken. Words felt insufficient. And yet I kept reading –&nbsp;everything I could get my hands on.&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted answers. I&nbsp;wanted to feel&nbsp;recognised. I wanted this untranslatable experience to be translated into language. Most of all, I&nbsp;think, I wanted restitution for all the&nbsp;maternal stories that had been left&nbsp;untold by centuries of silencing and minimising, not just for myself, but for all of us.</p> <p>Books about motherhood come in&nbsp;waves: the recent spate only the&nbsp;latest in a long line of literary endeavours. In&nbsp;the 1950s there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shirley-jackson\">Shirley Jackson</a>’s Life Among the Savages. The&nbsp;1960s wave saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-drabble\">Margaret&nbsp;Drabble</a>’s The&nbsp;Millstone and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/dorislessing\">Doris Lessing</a>’s The Golden Notebook, alongside Betty Friedan’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/11/feminine-mystique-betty-friedan-feminism\">The Feminine Mystique</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/13/featuresreviews.guardianreview36\">; the 1970s The&nbsp;Women’s Room by Marilyn French</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/29/adrienne-rich-poet-essayist-dies\">Adrienne Rich</a>’s Of Woman Born, and In Search of Our Mothers’ Gardens by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alice-walker\">Alice Walker</a>. In the 1980s writing about motherhood became even more&nbsp;transgressive and imaginative, with Beloved by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison\">Toni Morrison</a>, The Handmaid’s Tale by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood\">Margaret Atwood</a>, and Nights at the Circus by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/angelacarter\">Angela Carter</a>. The early 2000s saw an explosion in nonfiction, including accounts by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/rachel-cusk\">Rachel Cusk</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-enright\">Anne Enright. </a>And on and on, up&nbsp;to the present day, where no matter&nbsp;how much is written about motherhood, it&nbsp;feels as though there is&nbsp;still more to say. Three novels published recently have come the closest so far to giving me what I craved: The Nursery by&nbsp;Szilvia Molnar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/17/soldier-sailor-by-claire-kilroy-review-immersive-dive-into-the-baby-years\">Soldier Sailor by&nbsp;Claire&nbsp;Kilroy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/21/reproduction-by-louisa-hall-review-pregnancy-pain-and-frankenstein\">Reproduction by&nbsp;Louisa Hall.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a> said in an interview that she felt motherhood was one of those things “whose literary truth has yet to be explored”. I’m inclined to agree with her. How does one tell the literary truth of motherhood? These latest works are voice-led, and have an&nbsp;interiority that lends itself to this singular psychological state. They are also, I suspect, influenced as much by autofiction and creative nonfiction as they are by other novels.</p> <p>All are about relatively early motherhood, and are narrated by one mother. Were you to ask what happens, plot-wise, I would tell you: largely nothing. Except, of course, everything. A woman has a child and everything shifts. There is joy, and there is rage. It&nbsp;pushes her to the edge of her sanity, tears the fabric of the world she thought she knew completely apart. As plots go, I find this one highly compelling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Early motherhood, with its sleeplessness so extreme that it can lead you to the fringes of madness, is undeniably gothic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recent novels of motherhood explore work and identity, creation and loss, love, ambivalence, even regret. They are political without being didactic, furious and funny. If they could be said to have one thing in common, it is their corporeality. They are all unflinchingly of the body. Take the words of the narrator in Molnar’s The Nursery, a claustrophobic tale of postpartum madness (or is it?): “My breasts tingle. A blood-filled pad between my legs needs changing.” The&nbsp;mother in Hall’s Reproduction, whose attempt to write a novel about Mary Shelley keeps being interrupted by pregnancy, says: “I bled and I bled. I&nbsp;bled with such wild abandon.” Soldier,&nbsp;Kilroy’s main character, is less bloody, and funnier, but the maternal body remains present: “There was too much to be done to sleep or eat. Or even go to the toilet. New mothers say this in amazement, laughing like it’s funny, when it’s not funny, and we’re not laughing: we’re bewildered, we are&nbsp;floored.”</p> <p>“One of the many irritating things about fathers is that their bodies stay the same,” Soldier says. Soldier, Sailor takes the form of a monologue, told by Soldier, the mother, to Sailor, the son. His father is a mere visitor who intrudes on this most intimate of relationships from the outside world, “an adult place from which I’d been banished”, mostly in order to make unhelpful comments such as “Of course you can put him down.” It isn’t just our patriarchal society that has led to the husband’s displacement, however; it is also the visceral experience of birth and early motherhood, and the strength of the mother-child bond. “I shield your sleeping body with my arms, ready to proclaim to the heavens that I would kill for you: that I would kill others for you, that I would kill myself. I would even kill my husband if it came down to it.” In The Nursery, the mother reflects that “John has been a good man for as long as I have known him … And still, with the birth of Button, it was the death of John. I can’t help but make it sound as though my husband is dead when I describe him.”</p> <p>It may be surprising that contemporary novels sideline the father figure so spectacularly, and yet&nbsp;it feels true to the experience of most of the new mothers I have encountered, even now. Kilroy is particularly sardonic on this, with Soldier standing in a playground and remarking to another mum, entirely absorbed in her playing child, upon the absence of men: “‘When it comes to unpaid labour, where are the men. It’s gender apartheid in here.’ ‘Whee!’ the woman said.”</p> <p>The mother and child inhabit a domestic space that is insular and at times claustrophobic, with the man arriving like a visitor from another planet. Hall makes this explicit through metaphor, and the way she draws on science fiction. “Did all that really happen?” her narrator asks, after an intense labour scene. “It must have happened on the moon. That night, we were alone, the baby and I, in&nbsp;a hospital room on a new planet.”</p> <p>While Kilroy and Molnar’s mother-narrators are domestically isolated in ways that feel reminiscent of Ferrante’s The Days of Abandoment, where almost&nbsp;all of the action takes place in&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment, Hall’s Reproduction is as much concerned with the psychological dislocation brought about&nbsp;by the physical experience of motherhood. Of labour, she writes how “It caused me to feel a frantic, evil loneliness: a crazed and somewhat hysteric resentment toward every other person around, since I alone had been cast off into the darkness.” Hall draws on several literary traditions in Reproduction; her labour passages, appropriately, evoke the horror genre. (“When the next contraction passed, I got out of the cold water, dripping and slicked like a monster emerging out of the sea. I bared my teeth at the wall. I cursed my husband. I cursed the nurse.”) The section entitled Science Fiction, exploring modern assisted conception and the quest of one scientist to achieve motherhood by any means necessary, makes the link to Frankenstein explicit.</p> <p>Early motherhood, with its sleeplessness so extreme that it can&nbsp;lead to the fringes of madness, is&nbsp;undeniably gothic. These novels all have elements of unreality to them, which lead the reader to question whether&nbsp;what is being recounted is actually happening. They explore the&nbsp;intrusive thoughts that can prompt&nbsp;a mother, usually fleetingly, to&nbsp;want to harm her&nbsp;child. That impulse to do exactly the wrong thing simply because it is possible was characterised by Edgar Allan Poe as the Imp of the Perverse, but in early motherhood it is queasily coupled with&nbsp;an extreme hypervigilance, a survival mechanism making you aware of all the ways in which you must protect your child. It feels groundbreaking, in&nbsp;these novels, to see these states explored without shame. Discomfiting too: “Let’s wring you like a wet cloth” is the “urge, direct as hunger” that strikes the narrator in The Nursery.</p> <p>The new generation of women writing in English owe a debt to two who are not: the Italian Elena Ferrante and the French <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/annie-ernaux\">Annie Ernaux</a>, both of whom have written the truth of their lives and their bodies so unflinchingly as to make other works seem wanting. They have helped to blur the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, and their work features something previously elusive in anglophone fiction: physicality. Perhaps this is why, in Cusk’s recent short story The Stuntman (published in the New Yorker), the narrator speaks of a “double self” whose purpose was to absorb or contain all the aspects of biological femininity that can turn a woman’s ongoing life story into a problem that needs a solution, especially when she is in pursuit of autonomy and equality.</p> <p>Rereading Cusk’s A Life’s Work, a brilliant nonfiction account of early motherhood published in 2001, I am struck by how disembodied it is: strikingly intelligent, but somehow detached from the physicality of the experience. This generation of mother-writers have no such qualms. “This is the first book I have written with the body,” Hall states of Reproduction. “The key is to stop wanting things,” Molnar’s narrator is told. She reflects: “All this doing and no poetry.” But all these writers have created a kind of poetry – it is a poetry of continuing to want validation and self-expression beyond motherhood, while our maternal bodies at times situate us in that animal region Cusk describes. It can be a battle, yet, despite that, one of the most jarring things I have found about becoming a mother is how humdrum and uninteresting some others believe it to be. To quote Kilroy: “We all go bustling about, pushing shopping trolleys or whatever, acting like love of this voltage is normal; domestic, even.”</p> <p>Nothing prepares you perhaps, but&nbsp;these courageous novels come closer than most.</p>",

Haley’s pitch of calm instead of the “chaos” of Trump, and her positioning of herself as a relative centrist, could prove appealing in New Hampshire.</p> <p>“The Iowa Republican party is dominated by conservative evangelical Christians, whose first, second and third concerns are cultural relations – they care about LGBTQ+ issues, they care about abortion, all that sort of stuff,” said Christopher Galdieri, a professor in the department of politics at Saint Anselm College.</p> <p>“Republicans here, there is a constituency for those sorts of issues, but a lot of Republicans here, particularly in what passes for the party’s establishment these days, their main concern is fiscal conservatism, low taxes, low regulation.”</p> <p>Haley, who in the American media’s telling has become the main threat to Trump, was scheduled to hold a slew of events in the coming days, including intimate gatherings in New Hampshire’s smaller towns, such as Keene and Exeter. But in Manchester, where looming red-brick buildings serve as a nod to its UK namesake, it is Trump who seems to have the largest presence, with signs heralding the former president prominent and his campaign headquarters a hub of activity.</p>    <p>The former president traveled to New Hampshire on Friday after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/18/e-jean-carroll-defamation-trial-trump\">spending much of Thursday in court</a> in New York, where a judge is deciding what damages he must pay to E Jean Carroll, who a jury found was sexually assaulted by Trump in 1995. The case appears to have distracted him, at least in the short term, from his efforts to win the presidency: Trump spent Thursday night posting more than 30 times on Truth Social, the rightwing social media network he formed after being banned from Twitter (now X) in 2020.</p> <p>Still, as the vote approaches, Trump is following a similar plan as the one he used in Iowa, swooping in to New Hampshire to hold bombastic rallies in venues his rivals could only dream of filling. The one-term former president was due to hold four rallies over the four days before the primary, including one at the 10,000-seat SNHU arena in Manchester.</p> <p>Trump addressed thousands of supporters at the same venue the night before the 2016 primary, memorably <a href=\"https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/donald-trump-ted-cruz-new-hampshire-primary-rally-1201700403/\">calling Ted Cruz</a>, then one of his main rivals, a “pussy”. Trump had narrowly lost to Cruz in Iowa, but swept to victory in New Hampshire with a commanding 20-point victory that lit a fire under Trump’s campaign and propelled him to the Republican nomination.</p> <p>There are signs that things may be closer on Tuesday.</p> <p>In recent days Trump has complained about independent voters, who under state rules are able to vote in the Republican primary, potentially backing Haley, and has launched racist dog-whistle attacks <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/16/politics/trump-attacks-haley-birth-name/index.html\">against his opponent</a>. He referred to Haley, whose parents emigrated to the US from India, as Nimrada, a butchering of her legal first name, Nimarata. Haley has gone by Nikki, her middle name, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/05/05/fact-check-haley-didnt-white-wash-her-name-nikki-punjabi/4928061001/\">since she was born</a>, a spokesperson said in 2021.</p> <p>For her part, Haley is running <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eLzZ4Zy1F0\">a new ad in the state</a> which links Trump with Joe Biden, claiming “both are consumed by chaos, negativity and grievances of the past”, and her relative calm seems to have some appeal.</p> <p>“I like her policies. I like what she did in South Carolina. I think she’s got good international experience, obviously, as a former UN ambassador,” said Jeanne Geisser at an event at a fancy hotel in Salem, a 20-minute drive from Manchester. She voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but said she would cast her ballot for Haley this time.</p> <p>“With Trump, all these lawsuits that are going on, I don’t know what’s gonna happen with those. And just his demeanor, his belittling of people. I don’t see that as presidential,” Geisser said.</p> <p>One person mostly absent from New Hampshire is Ron DeSantis, the cowboy boot-wearing Florida governor who came second to Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Though he beat Haley there, DeSantis is averaging 5% in New Hampshire polls, and though he held some events in the state on Friday, he has largely switched focus to South Carolina.</p> <p>While the focus is on the Republican primary, there are Democratic hopefuls active in New Hampshire too; Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, a self-help guru, are engaged in a largely futile battle to replace Joe Biden as the presidential nominee.</p> <p>Both Phillips and Williamson have both spent weeks criss-crossing the state, but New Hampshire will effectively have no say in the Democratic primary, after an internal party feud. The national Democratic party ditched decades of tradition this year in choosing South Carolina, a much more racially diverse state, to host the first presidential primary. When New Hampshire said it would host its primary first anyway, the Democratic National Committee essentially <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/06/dnc-nh-primary-00134174\">said it would ignore the results</a>.</p> <p>That means most eyes will be concentrated on the Republican side of things next week, where Haley’s wealthy backers are demanding a good result.</p> <p>Ken Langone, the billionaire Home Depot co-founder and a key Haley donor, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c474184-3806-4d7c-8c46-6090901c5253\">told the Financial Times</a> on Thursday that he was prepared to spend “a nice sum of money” to support his candidate – but only if she does well in the Granite state.</p> <p>“If she doesn’t get traction in New Hampshire, you don’t throw money down a rathole,” Langone said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It’s cold outside, so it’s little wonder that in January, many people’s thoughts turn to holidays. Travel agents have already reported a strong start to the year – Skyscanner, a website selling flights and hotels, says it had record demand in the first week of 2024.</p> <p>If you haven’t yet booked a break but are considering doing so this month, here is our guide to getting a good deal on a holiday – and what you can do to future-proof your booking.</p> <h2><strong>How do I get the best deal on my holiday?</strong></h2> <p>The good news for those looking now is that, when it comes to summer holidays, <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/are-last-minute-holidays-cheaper-azFZA2M1UM1O\">research by the consumer group Which?</a> found that January is one of the cheapest times to buy.</p> <p>Which? checked the prices of thousands of short-haul package holidays offered by Jet2holidays and Tui. It priced up trips departing between 18 and 24 July 2023 five times: in October, November and December 2022, and in January and July 2023.</p> <p>For half of the six destinations it looked at – Greece, Turkey and Portugal – prices were at their lowest in December, on average. January was typically the second-cheapest month to book a trip to these destinations, and it was also the cheapest month to book an Italian holiday. Spain and the Canary Islands were the exceptions: booking in advance was typically pricier than booking at the last minute.</p> <p>While those destinations are always popular, widening your search could help you get a bargain. Skyscanner says “everywhere” is currently the most popular destination on the site, with searches up by 73% year on year. Key in some dates and hit its “explore everywhere” button, and you will see the cheapest flights to various places, ranked by price.</p> <p>If you are able to travel soon and are flexible, there are some real bargains. This week for return flights from London, leaving on 27 January and returning seven days later on 3 February, it suggested return flights to destinations ranging from Malta to Morocco for under £30. Deals included a return Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Stockholm for £27.98 (that is a basic “travel light” deal).</p> <p>The website says some flight prices have fallen sharply over the past 12 months: those to Faro in Portugal are down by a quarter, and elsewhere in Europe, Nice is also cheaper to get to than it was. The cost of flights to the US cities of Boston and Los Angeles have fallen by 10%, so somewhere you ruled out last year may now be within your budget.</p>    <p>Eurostar is one operator where, if you hold your nerve, you can sometimes get significantly cheaper tickets at the last minute. On Tuesday it put thousands of extra seats on sale for trips from London to Paris, Lille and Brussels between 24 January and 27 March, priced at from £39 each way. There will be many people who have already booked who will have paid twice as much for the same journey.</p> <p>To cut the cost of your break you may want to pick somewhere where the pound is strong against the local currency. At the time of writing, sterling was up by about 66% against the Turkish lira since January last year. Against the Japanese yen and Egyptian pound it was up by about 19% and 8% respectively. It’s worth keeping a close eye on exchange rates.</p> <h2><strong>How can I make sure nothing ruins my plans?</strong></h2> <p>As we’ve all learned in recent years, you can’t – this time four years ago, no one in the UK would have imagined a global pandemic would spoil their Easter break. What you can do is make sure you have as many safety nets in place as possible if you do have to change your plans.</p> <p>Booking.com and Expedia are among the sites that let you search for hotels and apartments offering free cancellation. The cut-off time for when this ends will vary – with some, you can cancel up to a week or perhaps two weeks before, and with others it is 24 or 48 hours before check-in. </p> <p>Typically you pay more for free cancellation: when we randomly picked a few Paris hotels on Booking.com that advertised different prices for the same room depending on whether you choose free cancellation or a non-refundable booking, the premium varied widely – from 2% to 18%.</p> <p>But a big advantage of selecting free cancellation is that you can keep checking the websites and hop over to a new deal if the price later falls or you find something cheaper. This strategy can also work with things such as car hire.</p> <p>Traditional package holidays may feel rather passé but they are very much à la mode when it comes to consumer protection. All UK companies selling holidays with air travel must be signed up to the Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing (Atol) scheme. To get its protection, you need to book a combined flight and hotel package with a UK-based firm.</p> <p>If the tour company or airline goes bust before or during the holiday, you should be offered an alternative, a refund, or repatriation if you are away. You also get legal protection, meaning you are covered if you don’t get the holiday you paid for – for example, if the hotel is overbooked or promised facilities, such as a pool, that don’t exist. Before you pay for the holiday, check the <a href=\"https://www.atol.org/check-for-atol/\">Atol website</a> to confirm your chosen operator is protected, particularly if it is a small, unknown company.</p> <p>Since 2018, a similar protection has applied to some flight and hotel bookings that might be supplied by different operators, provided they are booked simultaneously by the travel agent or website. The agent should provide you with your Atol certificate. Cruise bookers who start in the UK and therefore take no flight should use an Abta-registered provider for similar protection.</p> <p>The Civil Aviation Authority says it is important to protect your Atol certificate once you have received it, and to take it with you when you travel, either by downloading it or taking a physical copy.</p> <p>Always use a credit card when booking holidays, flights and hotels (or anything else that can go wrong). This is because when the transaction is more than £100, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act means the card company is equally liable with the retailer or supplier if something goes wrong.</p>    <p>If, say, the airline goes bust and you have booked directly with it, you can at least get your money back from the card company. To get section 75 protection, you have to have used the card to pay the supplier directly. You don’t get it if you used an online travel agent such as Expedia or Lastminute.com to book a flight. If you need the protection, always book direct – particularly if using airlines in far-flung spots that might be at risk of collapsing.</p> <p>Banks are very reluctant to pay out on these claims and sometimes do everything they can to avoid doing so, but this can be a financial lifesaver.</p> <h2><strong>Watch out for flight time changes</strong></h2> <p>When you book a flight, the time is not set in stone, and where schedule changes are made to the time or date (not the flight number), these are covered by airline terms and conditions, not by any law.</p> <p>Ryanair, for example, says it tries to notify customers of a rescheduled flight at least 90 days before their outbound flight or as soon as possible. If your flight changes and it is not suitable, the budget airline says you can switch it to a new time or date on the same route for free or apply for a refund.</p> <p>Given that a flight time change might derail your plans, it is worth monitoring your booking in your airline’s app in the weeks leading up to your trip.<br><br>This week, meanwhile, it was confirmed that thousands of Wizz Air passengers had received a total of £1.2m owed to them after the airline was taken to task by the CAA over its shoddy refund record. Among other things, passengers complained it did not help them in the aftermath of cancelling their flights. The airline has now changed its policies so as to meet its rerouting and care obligations, the regulator said. Guardian Money still gets lots of complaints about poor customer service at Wizz Air, especially regarding glitches with its online check-in. If you opt to fly Wizz Air, maybe expect the worst and hope for the best.</p> <h2><strong>What about travel insurance?</strong></h2> <p>Arguably the biggest mistake people make is to book an expensive holiday and then wait until the last minute to buy travel insurance.</p> <p>By buying both at the same time, you will get the all-important cancellation cover, which should step in if a serious accident or illness involving one of those going on the trip, or a close family member, prevents the holiday from going ahead.</p> <p>Finn Walsh, the chief executive of the travel insurer Staysure, says: “Most single-trip policies provide cancellation cover from the moment you purchase the policy… If you opt for an annual policy, you can select the policy start date and delay it up to 90 days from the policy purchase date but cancellation cover will only begin when your policy commences.”</p>    <p>This isn’t an issue if your trip is full refundable – you will be covering your personal possessions and emergencies while you are away, so the policy does not need to start until you travel.</p> <p>Walsh says if you buy a policy with cancellation cover now, you may end up spending more as the risk of something go wrong is greater than if you leave it to the last minute. But he says: “Insurance costs do fluctuate throughout the year.”</p> <p>If you book your flights and accommodation separately, buy a policy that includes scheduled airline failure insurance. This will step in if your airline goes bust before you get to go on board, as well as covering the usual medical emergencies once abroad.</p> <h2><strong>How to handle the baggage bills</strong></h2> <p>It is considerably cheaper to book your luggage allowance in advance than it is to pay at the airport. Some operators charge the same whether you do this when you book the holiday or the day before you travel, but some may charge more if you choose to add bags later: easyJet, for example, warns: “Prices may vary if you add bags at a later stage.”</p> <p>Generally, these charges are unavoidable unless you plan to travel very light. The fact that different airlines have different allowances makes it really hard to compare the full cost of a flight.</p> <p>We looked at the cost of a flight from London to Madrid over the Easter weekend (28 March-2 April). To travel with one bag measuring only 40cm x 20cm x 25cm on Ryanair costs £143.73 return. Opting for a larger bag that fits in the overhead lockers adds £32.25 each way, making a total of £208.23. Checking in a bag increases the cost to £246.21.</p>    <p>It used to be that it was only the original no-frills airlines that had an extra fee for bags, and that sometimes it worked out cheaper to go for an older carrier that included luggage as standard. However, now it is normal for the costs to be added to the ticket price you are first quoted.</p> <p>For that same trip to Madrid, British Airways, operated by Iberia, charges £274.79, which includes two items of hand baggage – one measuring up to 56cm x 45cm x 25cm and one up to 40cm x 30cm x 15cm. Checking in a bag brings the cost to £306, if you book in advance.</p> <p>The maximum weights vary across airlines. BA is typically most generous, allowing 23kg of cabin hand luggage and in your check-in bag. If you want to carry more than 20kg in your checked-in bag with Ryanair, the costs will start adding up.</p>",

An adventure of recent times, it is made exceptional by the way the narrative intersects with current events. It is the perfect book, at the right time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/15/john-lewis-civil-rights-giant-biography-raymond-arsenault\">‘He’d been through the fire’: John Lewis, civil rights giant, remembered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Raymond Arsenault also offers the first full-length biography of the Georgia congressman and stalwart freedom-fighter. The book illuminates Lewis’s time as a planner and participant of protests, his service in Congress and his time as an American elder statesman.</p> <p>Exemplary of Malcom X’s observation, “of all our studies, history is best qualified to reward our research,” Arsenault’s life of Lewis also brings to mind William Faulkner’s take on American life: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”</p> <p>John Robert Lewis was born into a poor family of sharecroppers in Alabama. Sharecropping amounted to slavery in all but name. White people owned the land and equipment. At the company store, seed and other supplies, from cornmeal to calico, were available on credit. The prices set for all this, and for the cotton harvest, were calculated to keep Black people in debt.</p> <p>Recalling his childhood, Lewis was not referring to material wealth when he wrote: “The world I knew as a little boy was a rich, happy one … It was a small world … filled with family and friends.”</p> <p>His school books made him aware of the unfairness of Jim Crow: “I knew names written in the front of our raggedy secondhand textbooks were white children’s names, and that these books had been new when they belonged to them.”</p> <p>His parents and nine siblings’ initial indifference to learning proved frustrating. They viewed his emergent strength, which would help him withstand a career punctuated by arrests and beatings, as a means to help increase a meager income. First sent into the cotton fields at six, Lewis was frequently compelled to miss class through high school.</p> <p>His political mission grew out of a religious calling. His was a gospel of justice and liberation. As a child he practiced preaching to a congregation of the chickens. In time, like Martin Luther King Jr, he was ordained a Baptist minister.</p> <p>Inspired by Gandhi and Bayard Rustin as well as by King, Lewis also embraced non-violence in emulation of Jesus. He took to heart Christ’s call to turn the other cheek: love your enemy and love one another. He called his modeling of Christ’s confrontation with injustice “getting into good trouble”.</p> <p>Education offered opportunities. In college, Lewis met and befriended likeminded young people. Helping form and lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he attracted others eager to take action, as Freedom Riders or whatever else gaining equal treatment might take.</p> <p>Lewis’s willingness to suffer attack while defending his beliefs gave him credibility like no other. The most remembered blow produced a skull fracture in Selma, Alabama. That barbaric 1965 assault against peaceful protesters came from authorities headed by George Wallace, the governor who said: “Segregation today! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!” A move to maintain white supremacy, the atrocity became known as “Bloody Sunday”.</p>    <p>Time after time, Lewis found unity among colleagues elusive. In 1963, at the March on Washington, four higher-ups insisted on softening his speech. Even so, his radicalized passion shone through.</p> <p>Collaborating with Jack and Robert Kennedy, their self-satisfied delusion masquerading as optimism, was also problematic. Time and again, political expedience tempered the president and the attorney general in their commitment to civil rights. Sixty years on, among lessons Lewis attempted teaching was the inevitability of backlash following progress. If Barack Obama represented propulsion forward, the improbable installment of Donald Trump was like a race backward. Angering some, this was why, looking past Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, Lewis endorsed for president the less exciting but more electable Joe Biden.</p> <p>Lewis’s ability to forgive indicates something of his greatness. Of George Wallace’s plea for forgiveness, in 1986, he said: “It was almost like someone confessing to a priest.”</p> <p>Rather like a priest, Lewis was admired across the House chamber. His moral compass was the “conscience of Congress”. Near the end of his life, in 2020, employing all his measured and collaborative demeanor, he exerted this standing in an attempt to restore the Voting Rights Act, gutted by a rightwing supreme court. Exhibiting what seemed to be endless resolve, he nearly succeeded.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>I met Lewis in 1993, in Miami, at the conference of the <a href=\"https://savingplaces.org/\">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>. The event’s theme, “cultural diversity”, got more dubious by the day. Only Black people attended excellent Black history workshops. Only rich white people toured Palm Beach houses.</p> <p>There were subsidized airfares, conference fees and accommodation for people of color. But I asked the Trust’s new president, Richard Moe, if it wouldn’t be good for the Trust to acquire <a href=\"https://savingplaces.org/places/villa-lewaro-madam-c-j-walker-estate\">Villa Lewaro</a>, a house at Irvington, New York, once the residence of Madam CJ Walker, a Black business pioneer. Moe answered: “I intend to take the Trust out of the business of acquiring the houses of the rich.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/17/sleeping-with-the-ancestors-book-review-slavery-black-history\">Sleeping with the Ancestors review: slavery and the fight for Black history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I hoped Lewis’s keynote address would deem preservation a civil right. It didn’t. Instead, Lewis lamented how high costs made preserving landmarks in poor Black neighborhoods an unaffordable luxury. Moe heartily concurred. I stood to protest.</p> <p>Moe cut me off: “Mr Adams, you are making a statement, not asking a question. You are out of order!”</p> <p>“No,” Lewis said. “The young man did ask a question! He asked: ‘Why in places like Harlem, with abatements and grants, taxpayers subsidize destruction, instead of preserving Black heritage?’ I never thought of it that way. And he’s right.”</p> <p>In that moment, John Lewis became my hero. As a preservationist, I share his mission to obtain that Beloved Community. It is a place where inclusion is a right and where welcome is a given.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>John Lewis: In Search of the Beloved Community is <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/john-lewis-in-search-of-the-beloved-community-raymond-arsenault/19972476?ean=9780300253757\">published in the US</a> by Yale University Press</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Michael Henry Adams is an architectural-cultural historian and historic preservation activist</em></p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>When Tony Gonzalez of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/illinois\">Illinois</a> required an organ donor to be freed from the dialysis machine keeping him alive despite his failing kidney, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona\">Arizona</a> woman named Joely Sanders stepped up.</p> <p>Sanders’s brother, Frank Pompa, also required a new kidney after one of his had failed – and, of all people, it was Gonzalez’s wife, Tracey, who provided the crucial organ donation to free him from his dialysis machine in October.</p> <p>The cross-country tale of generosity eternally interweaving the lives of the Gonzalezes, Sanders and Pompa went viral and provided some relief to the typically grim US news cycles after various media outlets – including the Tucson, Arizona, television stations <a href=\"https://www.kgun9.com/news/community-inspired-journalism/midtown-news/they-gave-the-gift-of-their-kidneys\">KGUN</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kold.com/2024/01/19/arizona-man-finally-meets-kidney-donor-who-saved-his-life/\">KOLD</a> – reported it on Thursday.</p> <p>As the station told it, Pompa learned in 2019 that he had only 10% kidney function. He twice weekly began receiving physically taxing treatments from a dialysis machine, which imitated the failing organ’s function by removing toxins from his blood.</p> <p>Sanders explored whether she could donate one of her kidneys to her ailing brother, but she wasn’t a match.</p> <p>“I was disappointed and I felt like, what are we going to do now?” Sanders said to KGUN.</p> <p>Yet she realized what a healthy kidney could mean to someone in need. Still interested in helping someone, a living kidney donor program administered by Banner University hospital in Tucson linked her to Tony Gonzalez, 55.</p> <p>The Gonzalezes, meanwhile, realized Sanders’s brother Pompa, 44, had experienced kidney failure, was undergoing dialysis and needed an organ donor’s kindness himself.

            "body" : "<p>Increasing numbers of children suffering from domestic abuse, serious neglect and homelessness are being refused help from over-stretched social services, schools across England have told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Child protection cases that would automatically have prompted intervention from social workers a few years ago are now routinely being passed back to schools to deal with themselves. The inability to obtain help for children whom schools think are in urgent need is taking such an emotional toll on education staff, who say they have neither the expertise nor the resources to cope, that some schools are bringing in counsellors to prevent their safeguarding teams becoming traumatised.</p> <p>Thomas Michael, deputy safeguarding lead at a secondary school in the West Midlands, said: “It’s almost at the point where the door is just shut. You know calls about children aren’t going to get anywhere and will be passed back to you.”</p> <p>He described a recent initial child protection conference with a local authority in which his school was pushing for a child to be referred to social services urgently, but they were told, “let’s wait and see what happens”. “What world is this?” he said. “We have to wait until something really serious happens to that child.”</p> <p>Michael is adamant that social workers are doing their best, but says after years of funding cuts they are thinly stretched and overwhelmed. Children who are already in the system are also struggling. One pupil had seven different social workers within 12 months, and each time a social worker left, their plan went back to the start “so nothing is done”, he said.</p> <p>Mo Granger (not her real surname), assistant head in a secondary school in the north-west, said staff are feeling “powerless and guilty” as numerous children’s cases that would have received help a few years ago are bounced back to the school.</p> <p>She said: “We finally had one child placed in foster care after trying to refer them several times over the past two years. We are often told there isn’t enough evidence, or ‘it’s not as bad as you think’.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Child neglect, which we recognise from poor cleanliness and nutrition, is hardly ever escalated to social services</p> <footer> <cite>Assistant head at a city primary school</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The police recently notified her school that they had attended a domestic violence incident at another family’s home. Social services are so over-stretched that they have not made contact with the school. The family now has nowhere to live, but the school knows that if it tries to refer them for support, it will get nowhere.</p> <p>“Homelessness used to be enough for a referral, but not now. They’d tell us to just give them information on where to apply for housing – which just isn’t available here,” she said.</p> <p>Susie Beresford-Wylie, director for Send, inclusion and safeguarding at the Olympus academy trust, which runs 10 schools in South Gloucestershire, said: “We’ve introduced supervision for our safeguarding teams to help them talk about what they are carrying, because they are under such pressure and so stretched. They carry this trauma with them.”</p> <p>Other schools have asked her to recommend similar support for their staff. While the number of children needing help has risen considerably, the trust has had to cut family liaison and pastoral support staff because they can’t afford them.</p> <p>Beresford-Wylie said that councils were now classifying many cases that would previously have passed the threshold for social care as “early help” – the stage before children’s services are involved, aiming at preventing problems becoming more serious. She said safeguarding leads in their schools said many of these cases were “way past early help”, and schools couldn’t manage without extra resources from the government.</p> <p>The trust has had to introduce a triage system for early help plans, with young people joining a queue for help. “That’s just wrong,” she said.</p> <p>She added: “We can’t ignore problems, or say ‘we’re full’, because we see these children every day and they need our support.”</p> <p>The headteacher of a primary school with a deprived intake in a major city, who spoke to the <em>Observer</em> on condition of anonymity, said: “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/britain-suffered-terribly-tories-children-neglect\">Child neglect</a>, which we recognise from signs like poor cleanliness and nutrition, is hardly ever escalated to social services. It needs to go on for years before there is intervention.”</p> <p>He said that children living with alcoholic and drug-dependent adults “are left to their own devices” and “numerous children are living in households that cause emotional abuse which aren’t classed as anywhere near the bar for intervention”.</p> <p>Sallyann Sutton, professional officer at the School and Public Health Nurses Association, said school nurses, who are working across 10 to 15 schools in some areas, are spending most of their time on safeguarding issues. “We are hearing increasingly from school nurses all over England that they are identifying children with more complex situations – domestic abuse or the impacts of poverty or poor housing – but they can’t get social services to take on the referral.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Nothing is more important than the safety of children. We are reforming the children’s social care system to better support families – prioritising earlier intervention and funding vital early help services, backed by £200m.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Cameron Norrie arrived for his third-round contest against Casper Ruud with the cards stacked against him. He had won one set in three defeats from three matches with the Norwegian. If he did not make significant changes in this unfavourable match-up, losing was the most likely outcome.</p> \n<p>It is to his immense credit that he did not hesitate to show a new dimension to his game. Instead of grinding from behind the baseline, a tactic that has brought him success throughout his career, the world No 8 took the initiative at the net, placed his opponent under constant pressure and emerged with a stellar 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-4, 6-3 win.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/19/alex-de-minaur-cruises-into-second-week-of-australian-open-with-win-over-falvio-cobolli\">Alex de Minaur cruises into second week of Australian Open with win over Flavio Cobolli</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“In terms of performances, it was up there with one of my best in a grand slam,” he said. “Losing that second set, he served really well. I came out with a lot of energy. Then down a break in the third I managed to stay really tough. I was committed to the gameplan and I loved it. I played really well.”</p> \n<p>Not only does the victory move Norrie into the last 16 of the Australian Open for the first time, but he pulled it off with one of his best wins. Despite being a top-20 player for the past three years, this is only the second time in 12 attempts he has defeated an opponent in the top 20 at a grand slam and Ruud at No 11 is his highest scalp yet at a slam.</p> \n<p>Ten days ago, it was hard to imagine such a result. The Briton began the tournament with notable injury concerns after wrist pain forced him to withdraw from Auckland, which was once the 28-year-old’s home tournament. He then stared down the prospect of defeat in the second round, trailing Giulio Zeppieri, a qualifier, by two sets before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/18/cameron-norrie-left-flying-flag-for-britain-at-australian-open-after-five-set-thriller-tennis\" title=\"\">winning in five sets</a>..</p> \n<p>“From that match, I didn’t play my best and wasn’t feeling mentally that good and was able to win in five sets,” he said. “So I was feeling really confident after that. Then waking up this morning, I was feeling good and ready to take it to Casper.”</p> \n<p>After overcoming those difficulties, Norrie burst out of the blocks with inspired, intelligent tennis and looked to take control of the exchanges, relentlessly attacking Ruud’s backhand, storming the net while forcing the Norwegian to find a passing shot on that weaker wing. He also served well and kept Ruud guessing by slipping in drop shots as he broke serve once and rolled through the set.</p> \n<p>Ruud maintained his composure and he started the second set serving extremely well. Under pressure from the Norwegian, Norrie played bold, attacking tennis whenever he trailed, landing first serves and flattening out his forehand. After holding on to reach the tiebreak, Norrie earned two set points at 6-4. On his second set point, he missed an easy backhand and Ruud eventually levelled the match.</p> \n<p>The momentum had clearly shifted in Ruud’s favour. After easing through his service games, he took a lead with a break at 3-2 in the third set, seemingly in control. But Norrie responded by returning to the tactics that had served him so well. He smothered Ruud’s backhand, volleyed brilliantly and constantly challenged his opponent to find passing shots with his backhand.</p> \n<p>Having retrieved the break, Norrie cruised through the remainder of the match on his terms. He held his nerve, clinching the final game by closing out each point at the net.</p> \n<p>As the John Cain Arena shook, it was one of Norrie’s best performances, winning 41 of 56 points at the net, striking 63 winners and offering a glimpse of new capabilities.</p> \n<p>He explained why he committed so strongly to playing in such an attacking manner despite the success he has had playing more conservatively. He noted that while his matches have always been physical, he was often the instigator. He is now trying to ensure the work is more evenly distributed.</p> \n<p>“I was playing physical and it was physical for me and not so much for the other guy,” he said. “I think about trying to make it physical for the other guy and that involves being aggressive. That’s when I’m playing my best.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After Wimbledon, Norrie’s form was in freefall. He lost 13 of 17 matches from then on. He seemed burned out from the weight of his heavy schedule and the supreme efforts it had taken. Now he is rejuvenated.</p> \n<p>“It helped having a good break and a really good off-season to put a lot of time on the court and get better as a player,” he said. “It comes down to how can you play the biggest points the best and feeling calm and feeling good about yourself. I have done that and I was feeling that coming into the season.</p> \n<p>“I want to keep going. I know it just gets tougher. Next match is going to be tougher. I’ll enjoy today and then move on.”</p> \n<p>His next match will indeed be tougher as he faces Alexander Zverev, the sixth seed, who beat Alex Michelsen with a 6-2, 7-6 (4), 6-2.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid, recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/02/such-a-fun-age-kiley-reid-review-white-liberals-black-people\">Such a Fun Age</a>,<em> </em>and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa. She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money, paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings of a new novel.</p> <p>We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the travel and the weather.</p> <p>It must have been daunting to embark on a follow-up to Such a Fun Age though. Reid’s debut climbed the bestseller charts in the US and the UK, the actor and producer Lena Waithe nabbed early film and television adaptation rights and Reese Witherspoon picked it for her book club. Six months later, it reached another milestone when it was longlisted for the 2020 Booker prize.</p> <p>Reid was in her apartment in Philadelphia when she got the call from her agent. “I was a little bit flabbergasted,” she says. “For it to be recognised in that way was really astounding.” She was concerned, however, about what people would say “about this very casual book making it to this very prestigious prize”. Interviewers asked her how she felt about her book being nominated for a prize that has a history of racism (the prize was first backed by the food multinational Booker McConnell, whose 19th-century English founders <a href=\"https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-brothers-and-enslavement\">managed cotton and sugar plantations</a>). “I’ve never seen white authors being asked the same question,” she says. “On the one end, it didn’t feel completely fair. And on the other, every university I’ve ever taught at has a racist past. It’s everywhere.” </p> <p>* * *</p> <p>‘It’s everywhere” is an enduring motif across Reid’s fiction, which highlights the ordinary social interactions in which larger forces – of class and racial inequality, financial and cultural capital – make themselves known. There are few outright villains in her stories; her characters often blunder along with good intentions, to comic and disastrous effect. “I love writing about instances where you go, <em>‘</em>What are you doing?’”<em> </em>Reid says, with a laugh. Such a Fun Age follows Emira Tucker, a 25-year-old Black babysitter employed by Alix Chamberlain, a white feminist influencer who lives in Philadelphia and resents the fact that she’s not in New York. Alix soon develops a longing to befriend Emira. She introduces Emira to her own Black friends; emphasises her high-street purchases in an effort to seem more down-to-earth, and plies Emira with wine. Emira, meanwhile, is more focused on financially surviving in a country without universal healthcare.</p> <p>While white liberal guilt and American east coast snobbery set the scene for Such a Fun Age, Reid’s new novel, Come and Get It, moves south to the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas. Set in a university, the racism is more overt, and the money exchanged and coveted with open hunger. The novel opens with Agatha Paul, a successful 37-year-old journalist and visiting professor, arriving at a dormitory to interview undergraduates about weddings. When the conversation turns to money – how much they would pay for a gown, what a “tacky wedding” looks like – Agatha finds herself “enraptured by these young women, their relationship to money, what they said and how they said it”. Afterwards, Agatha gives $20 to Millie Cousins, a fourth-year Resident Advisor (RA) who oversees dormitory life, as thanks for setting up the conversation. Millie adds it to her growing stash of questionably gotten gains (she also receives $20 from the dorm’s mean girl, Tyler, for swapping her old roommate – a socially awkward compulsive shopper named Kennedy – for a cooler one).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I love watching people try to be politically correct around money – parts of their deepest selves are revealed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Agatha, Kennedy, and Millie form the basis of Come and Get It. “I wanted to explore three characters who have very different relationships to consumption and money,” Reid says. Agatha is recovering from a breakup and is “splurging on everything”. Kennedy “thinks she doesn’t have an in-depth relationship to money, but it definitely shapes who she is and where she feels safe. When she gets nervous, she goes to Target.” Millie, meanwhile,<strong> </strong>becomes obsessed with the idea of owning a home, and is laser-focused on saving money. As one of the only Black women in the dorm, she faces racism and is treated by the white characters with a mix of entitlement and guilt.</p> <p>The American college experience has long been mythologised in films, television, and campus novels. The images are familiar: raucous fraternity parties; sorority girls in mansions; lecture halls filled with hangovers and regret. In Come and Get It<em>, </em>however, the action is mostly contained within the dormitory, and focuses on the awkwardness and loneliness of the residents as they try to live up to the hedonistic ideal. “I wanted to show excess and loneliness, which I think consumerism provides for us. I think that college is one of those places that says you can be better: all you have to do is buy all this stuff.” </p> <p>Like Millie, Reid spent a year as an RA at New York’s Marymount Manhattan College. She recalls the “feeling of always being on the clock”, spending many nights with the RA phone on her pillow, gripped with fear of sleeping through an emergency call. She studied acting, with a minor in religious studies. She was drawn to the subjects due to an “intense, deep obsession with storytelling” going back to her childhood in Arizona, where she remembers losing herself in books and writing her own stories.</p> <p>Her acting career was short-lived. A year after graduating, Reid was working as a nanny when she filmed a commercial. “I shot it on my birthday. I thought ‘This will be the greatest.’ But I felt something severely lacking,” she recalls. What she really wanted to do was write. She lived in New York for nine years throughout her 20s, working as a receptionist and nanny, while writing as a hobby. When her husband, a legal scholar, was offered a job posting in at a university in Fayetteville, Arkansas, she moved south for a year, working as a coffee shop barista and freelancing writer while applying for graduate writing programmes. She received a round of rejections the first time, before Iowa called. “I was giving myself one last shot,” she says about the application that would change her life. “I wanted healthcare and stability for myself. I was telling myself I would go back to writing copy.”</p>    <p>At graduate fiction workshops in Iowa, classmates observed that many of Reid’s stories featured discussions about money, and that it made them uncomfortable. The comments made her realise she was on to something important. “I love watching people try to be politically correct around money,” she says. “I think parts of their deepest selves are revealed in those interactions.” Equally revealing is the social discomfort of talking about money: “A doctor told me once that when you feel bad in your body, do a scan of how you’re feeling, and why you are feeling those things. I think I write about [times] where uncomfortable feelings come over characters, and they struggle in that moment to identify why and what it is that’s driving them there. A lot of it is social etiquette, and the history of racism and classism,” she says. “I think watching people in real time figure out why they’re sweating or feeling like they want to leave the room is a big part of the human experience.”</p> <p>Asked about her influences, the novelist often mentions nonfiction. The books that inspired Come and Get It are Lester K Spence’s Knocking the Hustle: Against the Neoliberal Turn in Black Politics; Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton’s Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality, and FS Michaels’ Monoculture and its consideration of consumption and loneliness. “What’s effective on an emotional level is seeing a socioeconomic situation played out in a personal way,” Reid says of her fiction.</p> <p>Writing is “a strange balance between using the real world and also wanting an entertaining ride. And not being exploitative of people.” This was a particular dilemma she faced when writing this novel, given that interviews with university students inspired its plot; though most people she talked to, she says, were “ecstatic” at the idea of being featured. “I’m not too afraid in that area.”</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Today, Reid is a teaches at the University of Michigan; her courses include a class on driving plot through dialogue and the rules writers set up in their fiction. She is also now a mother to a one-and-a-half-year-old: much of her new novel was written “with her in my belly”, and afterwards, “nursing her in the middle of the night”. Though time for writing is now more scarce – she mentions the “in between” moments snatched in the car and the office – motherhood has made her a “better writer”. “There’s something about having your priorities shift that makes the risks that you take in writing not seem like such a risk any more.” Meanwhile, there’s also the screen adaptation of Such a Fun Age, which Reid is executive producing. </p> <p>In interviews for her first novel, Reid spoke about the double meaning of its title. First, that it is a catchphrase commonly heard by people looking after young children, and second, that the novel, set in 2015, challenges the idea that Obama-era America was a post-racial Elysium. Some people “were struggling immensely” at the time, she says; their lives “didn’t just get better, some of those got worse, and I think ignoring that part is very irresponsible.” Economic inequality seems more openly acknowledged in the US today. Has Reid seen any change for the better? Not, she says, “until the median income for Black families in America drastically changes. Unfortunately it has stayed the same for the past 50 years. I think the conversations <em>around </em>it have changed,” she adds, noting that it is a bigger theme in literature, at least. </p>    <p>“Money runs our lives in a way that is so deeply ingrained,” she reflects. She hopes that her novels will open a window into what an alternative world might look like. “I like when my fiction sets up readers to wonder, OK, what if we had healthcare? What if you didn’t have to buy a house, and you were just given housing?”</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.mindymcginnis.com/podcast/kylie-reid-on-representation-of-language-amp-examining-race-in-fiction\">2020 interview</a> for Such a Fun Age, Reid was asked how she felt about publishing a novel that attracted such a huge amount of buzz and publicity. She described it as “surreal” before concluding that the meaning of some life moments only become clear after time. What does she make of it now? “I am bowled over and grateful that I now have a platform to tell stories. That is singular and spectacular. I can also recognise at the same time that putting a book out into the world is the antithesis of writing one.” There is a huge difference, she says, between the private act of writing – “you’re creating a refracted blueprint of what’s in your mind, no matter if you think it will sell” – and the public act of promoting the work. Though she is friendly and forthcoming in interviews, there’s still a sense of craving privacy and a discomfort with attention.</p> <p>There is happily more calm in her life now. Teaching her students and looking after her daughter are Reid’s main preoccupations at the moment, though she is as committed to writing as ever. “My goal is to do something different every novel,” she says. “To attack new genres, to try and access new styles and tones and different language. I love to try something new every time.” She mentions Donna Tartt, the Safdie brothers and Tilda Swinton as shape-shifting artists who constantly produce surprising and new work. “I’m reading through a bunch of James Baldwin’s books right now. I feel like he has a different little take every time, too. That’s the goal for my writing.”</p> <p>• Come and Get It by Kiley Reid is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

            "body" : "<p>A retired teacher has had her pension payments stopped four times because her pension provider repeatedly refuses to accept that she is not dead.</p> <p>Eileen McGrath, 85, was left without income over Christmas when Teachers’ Pensions, which administers payments on behalf of the UK government, wrongly matched her with a deceased stranger.</p> <p>“In November I had received two letters from Teachers’ Pensions asking me euphemistically if I was dead,” she said. “I immediately called to make it clear that I was very much alive. Nevertheless, a week later two more letters arrived asking the same thing, so I wrote back to reiterate that I had still not died.”</p> <p>Four days before Christmas, McGrath discovered that her pension had not been paid. Despite a further call to Teachers’ Pensions the widow’s pension payment she also receives from the scheme was also stopped. Both payments were eventually made on 2 January after she complained.</p> <p>McGrath said that she has been repeatedly asked to prove her existence since 2020 and faces losing her income each time. During the second lockdown she was staying at her son’s house and missed letters checking her circumstances. She only discovered there was a problem when her pension was not paid.</p> <p>She had fallen victim to a vetting procedure that regularly checks pension beneficiaries against the death register to prevent ineligible payments. According to the Department for Education (DfE), which oversees Teachers’ Pensions, death register entries may be matched to scheme members even if personal details differ.</p> <p>The DfE told the Guardian that once a possible match has been identified, the beneficiary may be asked to confirm that they are not the same deceased stranger every 12 months since the system, administered by Capita, does not log a disproved link.</p> <p>Letters sent to pensioners after a match state that a new process provides updates from the General Register Office on changes of personal circumstances and asks the recipient to get in touch. However, letters make no mention of a deadline or the fact that their payments will cease if they do not respond within 28 days. A spokesperson said this was “to avoid causing upset”.</p> <p>McGrath said: “After I complained, my pension was reinstated but there was no apology. The General Register Office lists the full name and the year of birth of deceased people. It is virtually impossible that there are any other retired teachers with my name and birth date who are dying year on year.”</p> <p>She said the letters did not make clear that pensioners should get in touch if their circumstances had not changed.</p> <p>“Do they really think that it would be more distressing to be warned that you might lose your pension if you don’t reply within 28 days, than to have payments stopped without notice?” she said. “This is Alice in Wonderland territory.”</p> <p>According to Steve Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP, providers would be expected to filter and investigate inexact matches on the death register before contacting a beneficiary, and payments should never be suspended without specific warnings.</p> <p>“While it is right and proper for pension schemes to make sure they are not paying out pensions to people who have died, there should be a high level of certainty that someone has died before pensions are stopped,” he said. “Rich data sources are available to help cross-check for accuracy if there is a possibility that a scheme member has died, and should be a built-in part of the process. Where someone has verified that they are still alive, they should then be treated the same as any other member and not subject to unnecessary additional checks, year after year.”</p> <p>After the Guardian queried the process, the DfE said it would make an exception and decouple McGrath’s name from the deceased’s so that she would not be contacted about it again.</p> <p>“Fortunately, I have enough money in my savings account to weather these incidents but I am sure that’s not the case for everyone,” McGrath said. “Besides which, it’s unpleasant and distressing to be told periodically that they think you are dead.”</p>",

Figures were even higher before the Covid pandemic, with 2,422 suspected in 2019 and 2,608 in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/30/sharp-rise-in-measles-in-england-amid-fears-over-anti-vaxxers\">a situation that also caused alarm</a>.</p> <p>Outbreaks have occurred around England in recent months, including <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/measles-outbreak-london-vaccine-symptoms-b2481362.html\">in London</a>, with the West Midlands experiencing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-67947095\">cases at their highest level since the mid-1990s</a>. Birmingham children’s hospital reported seeing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2qyy0q77ywo\">more than 50 children needing treatment in the last month</a>.</p> <p><strong>Don’t we have a vaccine?</strong></p> <p>Yes, it is very effective (about 99% after two doses) and free. It is given as part of the MMR jab, with the first dose typically given aged one, and the second at three years and four months. However teenagers and adults who missed out can also get vaccinated.</p> <p>Vaccination rates of about 95% would give the entire population herd immunity, meaning the few who are unvaccinated – for example young babies – are protected because those around them are immune to measles.</p> <p><strong>So what is going on?</strong></p> <p>The problem is that vaccination rates in some parts of the country are not high enough to prevent the virus from spreading. Data for 2022-23 shows only 84.5% of children in England receive the second MMR vaccine dose by five years of age, while in London and Birmingham a quarter of five-year-olds have not had two doses of MMR.</p> <p>Experts have put this down to a number of reasons, including some parents not realising the NHS was still offering MMR vaccinations during the pandemic, not realising how serious measles can be, having problems accessing appointments, or being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/25/no-no-no-avoid-them-all-anti-vaccine-conspiracies-spread-as-uk-cases-of-measles-increase\">swayed by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories</a>.</p> <p>Among the most influential pieces of misinformation was the 1998 claim by Andrew Wakefield that the MMR jab could be linked to autism – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/04/no-link-between-autism-and-mmr-affirms-major-study\">a theory that has since been comprehensively debunked</a>.</p> <p>Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, noted a UK study from 2019 that found that people born between 1998 and 2004 – the period after the Wakefield paper – were not only <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6802697/\">the most susceptible to measles, but also had the highest incidence</a>.</p> <p>However the latest data for England reveals that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-and-region-2023#:~:text=Update%20on%20England%20measles%20epidemiology&amp;text=Most%20of%20the%20cases%20in,to%20community%20transmission%20in%20England.\">the majority of the 209 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles between 1 January 2023 and 30 November 2023 was in </a>children under 10, reflecting the decline in vaccination rates.</p> <p><strong>Are other factors at play?</strong></p> <p>Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said the closure of schools, shops and other settings during the Covid pandemic would have reduced transmission of measles. Combined with reduced vaccination rates, this meant that once Covid restrictions were eased, there was a larger pool of susceptible people.</p> <p>“That of course creates a situation where you will then get more cases when the virus is around,” said Finn.</p> <p><strong>Where does this leave us?</strong></p> <p>In brief, the UK has returned to a situation that was already bad pre-pandemic.</p> <p>“We’ve been seeing hundreds of cases now which has been ramping up over a period of years,” said Finn. “I think it’s right that we should be worried because it’s completely preventable.”</p> <p>Indeed in 2016 the UK was declared measles-free. But that status has not been maintained.</p> <p>Hunter said that with vaccine uptake still declining in young children, he would expect measles to be an increasing problem in the coming years.</p> <p>Bedford also raised concerns. “Measles is nasty: if we do have large outbreaks it is inevitable we will have deaths,” she said. “But aside from the risk to children, it will also put additional pressure on the NHS at its most pressured time.”</p> <p><strong>What should be done?</strong></p> <p>Experts say it is crucial to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated against measles.</p> <p>But Finn added that funding was vital for proactive approaches, such as chasing people up to attend appointments.</p> <p>“A big part of this is just yet another legacy of a decade of underinvestment [in the NHS],” he said. </p>",

            "body" : "<p>A new fellowship to train an aspiring working-class journalist is aiming to help diversify the media landscape while honouring the memory and spirit of Eden Young, who died in an accident last year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.polyesterzine.com/eden-young-fellowship-raffle\">Eden Young Fellowship for Aspiring Working Class Journalists</a> aims to provide a year-long training and mentorship scheme at the independent online publication <a href=\"https://www.polyesterzine.com/\">Polyester</a>, where Young was a key figure.</p> <p>Polyester’s editor-in-chief, Ione Gamble, said the editorial team had been overwhelmed by support and love after the loss of their friend and managing editor. The 29-year-old fell from the window of a hotel room in Spain in June last year, having gone to the capital, Madrid, to cover the Primavera festival for the publication.</p> <p>“When we lost Eden, it was so sudden and so unexpected,” Gamble said. “It felt like there was such huge groundswell of love from the Polyester community, with people emailing me and asking what they could do. It was something I couldn’t like really comprehend so soon after her death, but now we are ready to help create something to really honour her legacy.”</p> <p>Polyester, which also runs a feminist pop culture podcast, hopes to raise £22,000 to fund the fellowship through an online raffle – which includes designer-donated items from Valentino, Marc Jacobs and Clio Peppiatt – and mentorship and feedback sessions from American actor and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/dec/09/tavi-gevinson-fashion-blogger\">Tavi Gevinson</a>, comedian and presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/29/amelia-dimoldenberg-interview-chicken-shop-date-oscars-red-carpet\">Amelia Dimoldenberg</a> and the Guardian’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/10/traded-sanity-for-milk-breastfed-despite-the-pain\">Sirin Kale</a>. Winners can also win a range of items and services from haircuts and makeup sessions to cakes and music memorabilia, said Gamble.</p> <p>Thanks to fundraising from Young’s family and the first 24 hours of the raffle, Polyester has already raised more than a fifth of the funds needed.</p> <p>“The way we are raising money is so in the spirit of the publication and of Eden,” she said. “It can be easy to be really cynical … but we have been absolutely just blown away by the support.”</p> <p>The organisation, which is based in Manchester and London, plans to pay the fellowship’s recipient the London living wage four days a week, providing training in all aspects of the publication including writing features, using social media and creating podcasts as well as bespoke mentoring.</p> <p>“When she started out, Eden had no formal experience and no contacts – but her attitude was very much to figure it out as she went along,” said Gamble. “We basically just want to be able to set someone up to then leave and be able to get a really good job in the industry.”</p> <p>The team at Polyester hope that the fellowship will provide a small opportunity to provide some much-needed diversity in the media industry. According to <a href=\"https://www.nctj.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Diversity-in-journalism-2023-4WEB.pdf\">Diversity in Journalism 2023</a>, a report from the NCTJ, 72% of journalists come from professional or upper-class backgrounds.</p> <p>“There is a real lack of opportunities for people from working-class backgrounds in this industry,” said Gamble.</p> <p>“So much is done by word of mouth or knowing someone and it is so London-centric and that creates an industry that is so unfairly skewed to middle-class and upper-middle-class people. And at the end of the day, that’s going to make our industry a lot more boring, because we’re going miss out on people like Eden.”</p> <p>The team hope that if they successfully raise the money needed for the fellowship, they can make it into a yearly programme.</p> <p>“I really hope it gives young working-class people some sort of hope that they can get into this industry,” said Gamble. “But also show them that they can make something happen by themselves, just with their group of friends.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Concerns have been raised about the future availability of silver dental fillings in Northern Ireland due to an imminent phasing out of the amalgam across the EU.</p> <p>The plan to phase out amalgam by 1 January next year will apply in Northern Ireland as a result of Brexit trading arrangements and will also affect dental care in other parts of the UK, dentist representatives said.</p> <p>This is because the ban includes a prohibition on exports of the product from the EU, and with much of the supply of the amalgam coming from Germany, there are fears supplies to the NHS will dry up.</p> <p>The British Dental Association (BDA) said Northern Ireland will be “disproportionately” affected, not just because of Brexit but because of the state of the health service in the region, the weakest in the UK with the longest waiting lists and the highest use of the filler. The <a href=\"https://www.bda.org/media-centre/government-failure-on-amalgam-ban-could-break-nhs-dentistry/\">BDA says amalgam is an affordable and efficient treatment</a> for dental restoration.</p> <p>An open letter from the BDA to the UK’s four chief dental officers, said: “This recent EU development is of critical importance for Northern Ireland. We do not believe the phase-out is feasible by 1 January 2025 given the significant state of unreadiness in oral health prevention and mitigation strategies currently in place. Urgent action must be taken.” </p> <p>Under the Windsor framework, and the Northern Ireland protocol before it covering the special Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, some previous EU rules must be observed, including those on the dental amalgam.</p> <p>“We are extremely concerned about the impact this EU phase-out will have on services across the UK, both directly under post-Brexit arrangements and indirectly as a result of supply chain collapse in Europe,” said the BDA.</p> <p>A spokesperson said data from Northern Ireland showed that the amalgam was used in 46% of fillings, the highest use of amalgam in the UK, a reflection of the poorer health outcomes in the region. England, by contrast, only used amalgam in about 33% of fillings.</p> <p>Regulations in the UK and the EU restricted use of the part-mercury fillings in 2018 as part of the <a href=\"https://minamataconvention.org/en\">Minamata Convention on Mercury treaty</a> to reduce global environmental pollution caused by mercury, including the release of the heavy metal during the production of dental amalgam.</p> <p>Although, according to the NHS Education for Scotland literature, there is no evidence of any harm caused by amalgam, the use of amalgam fillings in children under 15 and pregnant or breastfeeding woman was prohibited under the 2018 regulations, unless the dentist deemed it necessary.</p> <p>The BDA says amalgam is about 50% cheaper than the white filling material and is also longer lasting, raising fears of increased costs of NHS dental services, which it says are already in a “precarious” state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/14/nhs-medicines-shortage-putting-lives-at-risk-pharmacists-warn\">NHS medicines shortage putting lives at risk, pharmacists warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The loss of a vital restorative material and its replacement with more expensive and time-consuming alternatives is only a further blow to the financial viability of NHS dentistry. It is a particular loss in the context of high-needs patients for whom amalgam remains the best treatment option,” it said in its letter to the UK dental officials.</p> <p>MEPs have backed an amendment to limit the socioeconomic impact of the move.</p> <p>The Scottish government has passed an amendment to its existing Statement of Dental Remuneration legislation to mitigate the extra costs caused by the phasing out of amalgam. However, with the continued suspension of the power-sharing government in Stormont, no such legislation can be progressed in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Referring to talks on the final text of the rule that the European parliament has already approved, a Northern Ireland Office spokesperson said: “This proposal is still subject to further negotiations between the EU parliament and the council.</p> <p>“The UK’s position is simply to phase down the use of dental amalgam but our priority remains that everyone seeking dental care can receive it when they need it.”</p> <p>If finally agreed, the EU’s proposal could be stopped in Northern Ireland under the “Stormont brake” mechanism in the Windsor framework, but this would require Stormont to be up and running.</p>",

At the Centurion Club in Hertfordshire in the summer of 2022, the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer had to withstand a shout of whether he was “accepting blood money” through his association with LIV Golf. Household names in European golf sat on a podium – uncomfortably – while having to defend their defections to a tour funded by Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The same issues swirled around St James’ Park as Saudi’s Public Investment Fund bought a controlling stake in the club in late 2021. As fans whooped and hollered at the curtailment of the Mike Ashley era, there was discomfort elsewhere at a British sporting institution falling under the spell of an autocratic regime which has been intrinsically linked to the butchering of Jamal Khashoggi.</p> <p>Jon Rahm appeared under LIV branding last month. If you scratched seriously hard, you might have found analysis of what the Masters champion’s exorbitant deal meant in moral terms. Last June, the PGA and DP World Tours announced they would kiss and make up with the Saudis; a financial necessity rather than some mutual epiphany. With this news, golf seemed to collectively decide Rahm or anybody else who takes the Saudi dollar could do so with a clear conscience. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/16/keith-pelley-pga-dp-tour-golf-future-global-liv-pif\">‘This is a global game’: outgoing DP World Tour golf chief takes dig at US </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The PGA Tour is working desperately to conclude a deal with the PIF which will allow marquee events to have the presence of Rahm et al again. If golf’s grand plan collapses, LIV will continue to stand in lucrative opposition to the status quo. The narrative is of sport and business; human rights, once the automatic reference point for all things Saudi, are barely an afterthought. Golfers may reconcile the source of their pay day in their own minds but they no longer face public scrutiny over the same.</p> <p>In Newcastle, discourse surrounds whether Eddie Howe can retain his job or whether an injury crisis and the demands associated with Champions League football mean the manager has legitimately extenuating circumstances for a Premier League position of 10th. Just as well for Howe he isn’t dealing with ruthless overlords. Newcastle’s followers are audibly frustrated that financial fair play rules prevent the club from throwing even more money at players. Not even the Saudis can circumvent that.</p> <p>Rafael Nadal has agreed to become an ambassador for Saudi Arabia’s tennis federation. The inaugural Riyadh Season World Masters of Snooker will take place in March. Presumably snooker halls will simultaneously fly up all over the kingdom. Back in golf, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/22/ra-in-talks-to-fund-saudi-golf-schemes-as-kingdoms-acceptance-grows\">R&amp;A has confirmed discussions</a> about funding projects in the kingdom with the clear subtext that if there are fortunes flying about, the governing body rather wants a piece. Jordan Henderson’s switch to Ajax was a minor embarrassment to the Saudi Pro League – plus a bigger embarrassment to the England midfielder – but this will pale into insignificance when the next big name trundles along for £30m per year. The 2034 World Cup seems secure, by which time a teenager sentenced to 18 years in jail for voicing support for political prisoners will still have more than a third of her sentence to run.</p>    <p>Recent days served as another timely reminder of what precisely sport may have got itself into. It is not merely linked to Saudi Arabia but in certain cases beholden. Saudi Arabia is estimated to have spent more than $6bn on sports deals. This has always looked a dangerous dance.</p> <p>Yasir al-Rumayyan is the chairman of Newcastle United. He is the man who has almost single-handedly revolutionised elite golf by deciding Saudi’s PIF could take on the establishment. Rumayyan also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/17/newcastle-chairman-58m-lawsuit-malicious-instructions-yasir-al-rumayyan-moahmmed-bin-salman-saudi\">reportedly faces a £58m lawsuit in Canada</a> for “having carried out the instructions” of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, with “malicious intent”. The money is irrelevant; the potential reputational cost to umpteen sports should this case rumble on is not.</p> <p> LIV and Newcastle have diverted questions on the story to PIF, which has thus far had nothing to say. The claims allege that Rumayyan acted with the aim of “harming, silencing and ultimately destroying” the family of Dr Saad Aljabri, the kingdom’s former intelligence chief. The claimants allege Rumayyan was “directly involved” in a campaign lasting more than three years against Aljabri. This is hardly toy-town stuff. Neither is it surprising; even recent history dictated the goose laying sport’s golden egg was highly likely to attract interest for all the wrong reasons. If people were sufficiently willing to pay attention, of course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/17/jordan-henderson-set-to-complete-ajax-move-after-agreeing-al-ettifaq-exit\">Jordan Henderson set to complete Ajax move after agreeing Al-Ettifaq exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Premier League insisted it had “legally binding assurances” the kingdom of Saudi Arabia would not control Newcastle. Before peace broke out in golf, the Saudis argued Rumayyan and the fund he controls should be spared the giving of evidence during legal wrangling on the basis of sovereign immunity. Eyebrows were raised among some Premier League clubs but, in keeping to form, the matter basically disappeared. Let’s focus on VAR.</p> <p>The website <a href=\"http://reprieve.org/\">reprieve.org</a> reports at least 172 people were executed in Saudi Arabia in 2023. Is this a fair trade off for sporting prowess? Amnesty International continues to raise concerns. Its UK head of priority campaigns and individuals at risk, Felix Jakens, says: “If the sheer relentlessness of Saudi sportswashing has meant that human rights issues have recently taken a back seat to the big-name signings and the prestigious events, our assessment is that this is a relatively volatile situation and the pendulum can quickly swing back.</p> <p>“We’ve recently seen very disturbing reports about the alleged involvement of the chair of Newcastle United and LIV Golf in serious human rights violations, something which is currently being investigated. Beneath the glitz of sporting photo-ops and carefully stage-managed events in Riyadh and elsewhere, the human rights situation is still dire in the country. With the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia still deteriorating, it’s almost certainly no coincidence that the Saudi sportswashing machine has recently been operating at ever-greater levels of intensity.”</p> <p>Aha, sportswashing. It was once a live thing. Rumayyan’s latest spell in the spotlight dictates it may have been seriously unwise to look the other way. Sport may just be in too deep.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>We are only three weeks into a brand new year but already TikTok users are dictating what some are saying could be the biggest trend of 2024.</p> <p>Out are the cutesy “Tomato girls” with their full skirts and raffia basket bags. Gone are the gentle linen-clad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/aug/26/im-shocked-britains-coastal-grandmothers-on-becoming-tiktok-style-icons\">“coastal grandmothers”</a>.</p> <p>In their place comes a woman with a whole lot more bada bing.</p> <p>Dubbed the “mob wife aesthetic”, the look involves massive fur coats, glossy leather, clashing animal prints, coiffed hair and stacks of gold jewellery.</p> <p>Its popularity can be linked to cult TV series The Sopranos, which first aired in January 1999. To celebrate its 25th anniversary, HBO has launched an official Sopranos TikTok account <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/11/the-sopranos-tiktok-edits\">featuring condensed 25 second recaps of all 86 episodes</a>. This has led to a whole new generation, many who weren’t even born when the show first aired, discovering it, with many homing in on the female characters’ gaudy style.</p> <p>On the second hand shopping platform Depop, searches for leopard print are up 213% and gold hoop earrings up 70%, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2019/jan/04/move-over-millennials-and-gen-z-here-comes-generation-alpha\">Gen Z and Alpha</a> try to emulate Carmela Soprano and Adriana La Cerva.</p> <p>This week film director Francis Ford Coppola even got involved. On Instagram he posted a still of his sister Talia Shire dripping in diamonds as Connie Corleone and Diane Keaton in pearls as Kay in The Godfather with the caption “I hear the ‘mob wife aesthetic’ is making a come back…”</p>    <p>It’s not just fictional characters that are being referenced. The daughter of the convicted killer and boss of the Gambino crime family John Gotti, Victoria Gotti – who is said to base her flashy clothes and long tousled blonde hair on the Italian fashion designer Donatella Versace – is being hailed as style leader. Images of Renee Graziano, the daughter of Anthony Graziano, the former Bonanno family consigliere whose stars in the reality TV show Mob Wives, also pops up on numerous mood boards.</p> <p>Last week, Nunzia Giuliano, daughter of the 80s mafia boss Carmine Giuliano, even tapped into the trend by launching a perfume named after her father. Dubbed ‘O Liò’, an abbreviation of his nickname ‘O Lione’, the first batch sold out within days. “By buying this fragrance you are showing respect to my father because you received respect from him,” Giuliano shared in a video to her 15k followers.</p> <p>While TikTokers embracing the aesthetic get dressed up to capture content over chequered tablecloths and steaming bowls of vongole at their local trattoria, it’s funerals, weddings and the courtroom where real mob wives flaunt their style. Clare Longrigg, author of Mafia Women, describes it as a “hutzpah”. “There is so much performance involved in being a mafia wife,” says Longrigg, who points out how clothing is used as a signifier of power. “You can’t show any weakness. It’s brash and it’s bold and it’s all part of keeping up a front.”</p> <p>Juliet Polcsa, the costume designer for The Sopranos, describes the renewed interest in Carmela Soprano’s style as “flattering but baffling”. To hone Carmela’s look, Polcsa spent time observing shoppers at malls in New Jersey rather than real mob wives. Polcsa describes Carmela as a “nouveau riche suburban housewife”.</p> <p>“She didn’t have the sophistication of someone wealthy but she had money. It was 1999 and fashion had a specific theme. Matchy-matchy outfits, jewellery, nails and hair were very important,” she said.</p> <p>The Italian American author Sarah Arcuri, who has earned the moniker “Mob Wife Aesthetic CEO” on TikTok thanks to her wardrobe and makeup tutorials, says the glamorous style is something she has grown up with. Based in New Jersey, her family originally hail from Sicily, with Arcuri explaining how her mother and grandmother instilled in her from a young age the importance of looking “put together”.</p> <p>“It’s flattering that people want to dress like us now. But I think some people are confusing it with a costume. It’s not. A the end of the day “Mob wife aesthetic” is just another word for 80s glam,” she said.</p>    <p><strong>How to get the look</strong></p> <p><strong>1. The </strong><strong>fake fur coat</strong></p> <p>While real mob wives pass down floor-sweeping furs as family heirlooms, the younger TikTok generation prefer fake.

            "body" : "<p>“I fell out of love with football for a long time,” Steven Caulker says. “When I was suffering from depression and addiction, I completely fell out of love. I couldn’t have imagined anything worse than still being involved. But I managed to rekindle that: I couldn’t really tell you how, it just kind of came back. It’s pleasing to get it back in a new way, a new form, and now I can enjoy the moment. I loved training this morning. We’ve got a game this afternoon. I just really like being here, being present.”</p> <p>It is Tuesday morning and the former Tottenham, Liverpool and England defender, who now captains Sierra Leone, sits on a bench wheeled on to a blue track around the grass at the Enrique López Cuenca, a municipal athletics ground in the little seaside town of Nerja. To the right a woman launches a medicine ball. From the left a Dutch running club passes. “Life’s so random,” he says, gesturing beyond them. “My girlfriend lives not far away. Me and my little boy stayed in a hotel, not joking, two minutes down there.” Now it’s home, where Caulker has just become player-manager of Málaga City, in Spain’s fifth tier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/19/jeff-stelling-sky-sports-soccer-saturday-chris-kamara-football\">Jeff Stelling: ‘Every week I was fighting a battle and it was making me ill’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caulker, 32, is a fascinating, articulate, warm man of depth and honesty. It is only nine months since he left Wigan and a couple of weeks since he was training at Charlton. This was not planned and it is a big task. Early too. He is learning Spanish, still has to get his A and Pro licences and is waiting for the residency papers that formally permit him to be on the pitch or the bench during matches. But he is happy today and that’s something. For a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/29/steven-caulker-mental-illness-addictions-gambling-drinking-qpr\">recovering addict who battled depression</a>, it is everything. The only bad thing, he says, is when they throw javelins and shot puts on to the pitch.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.fcmalagacity.com/\">Málaga City academy</a> was founded by George Jermy in 2013. There are 175 players from 40 countries, eight teams of all ages. The senior side, where Jermy is the left-back and Caulker will be in central defence, plays in Group 9 of the 324-team Tercera Federación, below La Liga’s first and second divisions, the 40 teams and two groups of Primera Federación and the 90-team Segunda Federación. They are in the relegation zone and Caulker’s first game as coach ended in a 6-0 defeat. “In at the deep end,” he says, smiling.</p> <p>“What George has created is amazing,” Caulker says. “Players get another chance, get work too, learn a new skill. My <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/12/behind-white-lines-training-camp-released-talents-second-chance\">Behind the White Lines academy</a> guides footballers released by academies, helping them find clubs, preparing them for other paths and I had been talking to Málaga City about opportunities for them. It wasn’t about me but George wore me down. Bit by bit. When I got my B&nbsp;licence, he messaged: ‘Come here, develop as a coach. You can play too. Best of both worlds.’</p>    <p>“I definitely wasn’t always looking to be a coach. But when I joined Sierra Leone, I got involved. I got that feeling, a passion: impact the game differently. I had been looking in the UK for a player-manager job. The feedback was: ‘You haven’t got the experience.’ The market is saturated. So when they gave me the opportunity here, I thought: ‘Yeah, I want it.’”</p> <p>So soon? At 32, it is early to depart the professional game. “Yeah, but I started at 17 and to be honest&nbsp;…” Caulker begins, the pause saying much. He’d had enough. Charlton would have been his 15th club. Wigan ended with him speaking up for players and tearful staff who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/mar/24/steven-caulker-accuses-wigan-of-lying-after-fifth-failure-to-pay-players-wages\">had not been paid</a>.&nbsp;He was tired of moving&nbsp;around, being away from his son, his family. Of the whole thing, the&nbsp;disillusionment.</p> <p>Caulker scored on his debut for England, was so good <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/30/steven-caulker-alanyaspor-turkey-hostile-coronavirus\">at Alanyaspor</a> that Fenerbahce came for him and there’s huge enthusiasm in how he talks about Sierra Leone. But football, life, had not been easy and he was unable to enjoy the moment. He became an addict: first gambling, then alcohol. He would black out, wake up in police cells and find himself before judges. The shame was intense. He lost his money and his driving licence, was diagnosed with depression and fell critically ill. Addiction, anxiety and self-loathing, partly a product of the game, had left him considering&nbsp;suicide.</p>    <p>“It becomes your life. I put pressure on myself because it was my whole identity. For maybe seven, eight years now my dad has said: ‘If you don’t want to play football, don’t. I don’t think it’s good for you.’ It’s every dad’s dream but he’s like: ‘Please, do what makes you happy. Don’t chase it. You don’t need it. All I want is you to be happy. I don’t need to go to Wembley or Fenerbahce.’</p> <p>“At Wigan, Kolo Touré signed me. Ten days later he’s sacked. I thought: ‘What am I doing?’ Closure came at Charlton. It was the right time. I realised I didn’t want it. So that’s basically it. In Turkey I enjoyed football again away from the pressure cooker, a clean canvas where no one knew me. And Sierra Leone was completely new. But then the pain of a bad move at Fenerbahce and two nightmare years brought me to the end. I could go to another club for six months or start something fresh. That’s why I took this opportunity.</p> <p>“Thing is,” he adds. “I want to play for the national team still, which is why this isn’t just coaching. I have a responsibility. We never qualified for this Afcon, which I’m gutted about and I definitely want to take us to the next. As captain, that’s my duty. We have created a culture over two years. Players look up to me, always on the phone for support; I’m not ready to step away. I would like to play a couple more years and potentially manage them one day. So I need to play here regularly.”</p> <p>Is this level good enough to play internationally? “Good question. I guess time will tell.”</p>    <p>What happens when he has to drop himself? Caulker laughs. “I don’t know, I hope that day doesn’t come. It may do. We had to sub George at half-time the other day! It’s going to take honest reflection but at this stage of my life I have that. I’m able to be honest with myself, accountable.</p> <p>“A purpose, I would call it,” Caulker says. “I know there’s pressure too but it’s different because I’ve done a lot of therapy. I am more mature. When I was younger I was so impulsive. Football’s not my whole identity now. It’s something I do. I’m a father. I do recoveries, the 12-step programme. I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/05/steven-caulker-sierra-leone-charity-trip-qpr\">a school in Africa</a>. I’m someone who likes to help people.</p> <p>“I’ve worked with managers who would literally go ‘OK lads, five-a-side’ and with some geniuses. Francesco Farioli: possession and playing out. Brendan Rodgers: I was 19 and he made me feel at home, loved, welcomed. Kolo: every morning, big bear hugs. So positive. Jürgen Klopp: his press was genuinely different, unbelievable. I was always on the other XI in training and I could see, day by day, how good they were getting. I receive the ball, and <em>bang, bang, bang. </em>I left there thinking: ‘They’re going to win the Premier League.’</p> <p>“I can learn from them all and I would like to play a high press: with possession and intensity. But after my experiences, my biggest strength will be man-management, 100%. Communication with players, honesty&nbsp;… it sounds simple, right? But I swear, 15 years as a pro and you rarely see it. On Thursday or Friday I give the team. Looking back, I didn’t like finding out at 1.30pm, by which time your whole family is in the stands, they’ve travelled up. You thought you’re playing&nbsp;… and then you feel that shame.</p> <p>“I’ll put my arm round players, give opportunity, but there’s a reality too. I’ve had managers who say: ‘You’re better than them, I’d take you over any of them,’ and you’re thinking: ‘You would literally transfer all of us.’ I wasn’t ready for the opportunity at Liverpool so I was moved aside, rightly. Hendo [Jordan Henderson], [Adam] Lallana and [James] Milner were driving standards forwards. But I wasn’t in a good place mentally. At the time, you can feel hard done by but looking back, having done therapy, I see it. I respect it.”</p>    <p>Could things have been different? “Probably not. I went straight from Liverpool to rehab – for the second time. It had to happen. I had to hit rock bottom to be where I am today.</p> <p>“I’ve had several rock bottoms. I kept falling and falling. I have hit rock bottom while in recovery, rock bottom when sober. Financial rock bottom, emotional rock bottom, physical rock bottom. Another is when no team will touch you, no one returns your calls, no one gives you an opportunity. People look for one moment.”</p> <p>Caulker clicks his fingers. “But there isn’t one, there are several. Eventually it’s that need, absolute desperation. ‘I’ll do anything. Help me change.’ The key for me is maintaining it. Honestly, it’s the biggest message I give people: it’s a daily discipline.”</p> <p>That’s here each morning, an hour’s drive from Málaga with language tapes and therapy groups for company. “I wake up, do my gratitude list: 10 things I am grateful for and five I don’t miss. I do serenity prayers. Some days you feel it, some you don’t&nbsp;… You go abroad you can lose your recovery network but there are English [groups] here and, since Covid, online meetings. I leave at 6.30am, do a meeting in the car. I get here and I’m good to go.</p> <p>“There might be a little naivety but I come here, away from the pressure to get results or be sacked in two, three games. No date on the contract: a chance to make mistakes, express myself and find what works for me. Honestly, I don’t have a plan. Maybe the ultimate goal is be back in Premier League as a manager but I have no idea how to get there. I’m in the fifth division in Spain. It’s exciting because the possibilities are&nbsp;endless.”</p> <p>There’s the smile again. “Personally, I feel good at the moment,” Caulker says. “Really good. My girlfriend is by my side. My family know how random my life is and can hear in my voice that I’m settled. Everything’s positive&nbsp;… Without purpose in life I do struggle, for sure.

            "body" : "<p>No small task awaits Jordan Henderson at Ajax. The England midfielder and former Liverpool captain must become the leader and inspiration of a mostly young, unbalanced and heavily criticised team.</p> <p>This is a side who were knocked out of the Dutch Cup less than a month ago by opponents, USV Hercules, who do not even play at the highest amateur level. Ajax, by far the wealthiest club in the Netherlands and successful in the Champions League between 2018 and 2022, slumped to the bottom of the table in late October and are now fifth, nine points from the top three places that would entitle them to elite European football next season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/19/ive-never-tried-to-hurt-anybody-no-regrets-for-jordan-henderson-on-ajax-arrival\">‘I’ve never tried to hurt anybody’: no regrets for Henderson on Ajax arrival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fans, press and former players such as Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Marco van Basten have been ruthless in their criticism. For them the “miserable way” Ajax have been playing is incomprehensible, particularly the state of the midfield and defence. But so, too, is the fact the team have to contest a playoff against Norway’s Bodø/Glimt next month to continue in the Europa Conference League; and that of the 10 fairly unknown players who arrived last summer, only one is considered suitable: the goalkeeper Diant Ramaj.</p> <p>Criticism also comes from inside. “Lack of vision and leadership are the main reasons for the decline,” the experienced Remko Pasveer, Ajax’s reserve goalkeeper, said in an explosive interview with the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool. “Many newcomers do not have the Champions League level that Ajax aspires to. And they don’t understand the club.”</p> <p>Does Henderson understand this complex club, where the former coach Louis van Gaal has returned as an adviser, the former captain Danny Blind is back as a member of the supervisory board and the former player John van ‘t Schip has been appointed as the temporary coach, but which yearns for a fully fledged executive board? Does the 33-year-old still have Champions League quality?</p> <p>That’s probably not even the most important thing. The versatile midfielder has a wealth of experience and has been praised for his work ethic and leadership. That is what Ajax need most after parting ways with the team’s talismans Daley Blind (one year ago) and Dusan Tadic (last summer).</p>    <p>“Two years ago, it was always busy in the gym even after training,” Pasveer says. “Players like Dusan Tadic, Davy Klaassen, Lisandro Martínez, Daley Blind, Antony or Sébastien Haller always wanted to get better and stronger, even in their spare time … I see less dedication among the current generation of players, and that worries me.”</p> <p>With the arrival of Henderson fans are full of hope, cheered by the words of Pepijn Lijnders, the Liverpool assistant coach, who was consulted by Henderson about Ajax. Lijnders told the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant: “He is a complete midfielder, full of character. He corrects his fellow players and coaches a lot, so that no one has a moment to not be focused. He was our captain all those years – that says it all. He takes the team in tow and can become the coach’s right-hand man.”</p> <p>What adds to the enthusiasm is a sense of disbelief that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/18/jordan-henderson-completes-his-move-from-al-ettifaq-to-ajax\">deal has happened</a>. These days Dutch clubs don’t often succeed in attracting well-paid foreign players with such a proven record. PSV Eindhoven’s signing of German World Cup winner Mario Götze in 2020 is a rare modern example.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2024/jan/17/jordan-henderson-has-badly-damaged-his-image-and-that-of-the-saudi-pro-league\">Jordan Henderson has badly damaged his image – and that of the Saudi Pro League | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shirts with Henderson’s name on the back have been flying across the counter at the store at the Johan Cruyff Arena. Ajax fans have already given him a nickname (“Henny”) and a joker in Amsterdam crossed out an ‘a’ on a sign in the Amsterdam neighbourhood Jordaan so it reads Jordan.</p> <p>“His arrival means a major boost in quality for our selection,” Van ‘t Schip says, although Henderson will not be able to face RKC Waalwijk on Sunday while he waits for a work permit. “A footballer of this calibre is also important for the many young players, both on and off the field.”</p> <p>The fact that Henderson is 33 and has spent the past six months in the mediocre Saudi league raises some doubts in the Netherlands as to whether this will be a golden match. But there is hardly any talk about the ethical choice of Henderson to play in a country where homosexuality is prohibited, after he positioned himself in England as a strong advocate for the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <p>Thijs Smeenk, a sports journalist and board member of the John Blankenstein Foundation, which promotes gay and lesbian rights, says he is happy with Henderson’s arrival. “In the Netherlands, gay acceptance is going backwards rather than forwards, including in football environments. It’s nice to welcome a player who really dares to speak out for the acceptance of gay people. We don’t have enough of that on our football fields. I assume that Henderson still stands for that.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>“There were a lot of times in the 90s,” Kate Moss said to Vogue last week, “when I was young, free, single, no responsibilities apart from getting to work … other than that, the world was my oyster.” The model was reflecting on turning 50, as she did on Tuesday, celebrating in Paris with her daughter, Lila, and 35 friends.</p> <p>One of the smartest decisions Moss ever made was that she would almost always never give interviews, and that remark to Vogue was no exception; even though there are words, what is she actually <em>saying</em>? That the world is no longer her oyster? That she is no longer young, free or single (she has been going out with Nikolai von Bismarck since she was 41)? Or something else, something more “no regrets” – the 90s were then and this is now, and the preciousness of the past is that it can’t be relived?</p> <p>Welcome to your 50s; it’s complicated.</p> <p>I turned 50 last August, here’s what I know. A lot of people worry about how they look, whether they could still pass for anything beginning with a four. I think people are daft on this subject: if you’re concentrating, you can read a person’s age in their eyes, precisely. You can see how much they’ve seen. The rest of the stuff, the day-to-day degradation, is second-order. But none of that will detain Moss anyway, any more than you’d catch Cleopatra worrying about her crow’s feet.</p> <p>The other thing people worry about a lot is how to mark the event, which feels so seismic: you can’t lay low, because you look like a coward or as if you’re in denial. Do you want to celebrate with everyone you’ve ever met? Your eight closest friends? Do you still have eight friends, or did you mislay a few when you went teetotal? To mark the event quietly feels like surrender. But acting like you’re 21 will land you in A&amp;E.</p> <p>A friend of mine manages an event place in Scotland, and they’ve banned 50ths. Hen nights, stag dos, 40ths, no problem: but some combination of the manic nihilism that sweeps over people and the middle-aged mal-coordination that crept up on them leads to a wild amount of breakage. Whatever the party anxiety is, and however overwhelming it feels, it’s useful as a displacement emotion. The proximal moment of becoming 50 is, in the end, a lot less terrifying than the point it marks in your life, a whole half-century lived, probably somewhat less than that to come.</p> <p>It’s weird: I never understood people fretting about their landmark birthdays. People used to worry about turning 30 because that was the deadline for the life stuff: had you found anyone resembling a plausible life partner, did you have a place to live? But that felt random, artificial. Forty, meanwhile, was theoretically when you were meant to face up to what you probably wouldn’t now achieve, whether that was having children or becoming a neurosurgeon. Again, it felt like the kind of milestone a magazine had dreamed up, rather than a real thing that everyone would reliably experience at the same time. Which isn’t to say that those deadlines and regrets don’t exist, rather that they’re more likely to punch you in the face at some weird time, probably 43 and a half.</p> <p>Fifty has a different pull, and it’s undeniable. One friend called it sniper’s alley, this decade; suddenly, there is always someone falling ill; always someone dying. Another friend got really irked by that image, saying it was too violent. We had a three-way row about whether that’s what life <em>was</em>, violence – and this is not how we spent our time in the 2010s, arguing about life’s essence and the meaning of pain. You start thinking in units of time you have left, doing weird maths. My dad died at 64, which is only 14 years away. Fourteen years ago, I was saying no way would Labour lose the election. It seems so unspeakably long ago, and yet at the same time, like it was yesterday.</p> <p>Everywhere you look, your contemporaries are reading that James Hollis book, The Middle Passage: from misery to meaning in midlife. You really don’t want to join them – you don’t have time to look for meaning, you can’t even find your keys. It sounds arduous and inconvenient.</p> <p>Unarguably, though, mortality is interesting; time has more consequence when it’s running out. Conflict is dramatic to watch but boring to live; urgency is dramatic to live. You thought you were playing Scrabble, but actually you’re playing Boggle. Which, you have to admit, is the better game.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A group of charities are to take over part of Fenwick’s former Bond Street department store next month, bringing secondhand clothing to one of London’s most exclusive shopping locations.</p> <p>From 9 February, the <a href=\"https://www.charitysupermkt.com/\">Charity Super.Mkt</a> group, which involves five charities including Shelter, Traid, Shaw Trust and Havens Hospices, will temporarily inhabit the former handbag and accessories section. Fenwick is moving out of the site after almost 133 years.</p> <p>Described as the “pre-loved” department store, the multi-charity shop will be open for a fortnight. It will also host events with DJs at weekends as it trades alongside the stores of luxury brands including Dior, Hermès and Emporio Armani</p> <p>The charities will use fittings and even hangers from Fenwick as well as some items donated by the designer brands that will be finishing their packing up behind hoardings in the rest of the store.</p> <p>The department store chain, which was founded in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1882 by John James Fenwick, announced in 2022 it was selling the site on New Bond Street to invest in its seven other locations, which include Newcastle, Kingston in south London and York, as well as updating its online presence.</p> <p>The new owner, which bought the building for a reported £420m, is to convert it into a mixed-use development with retail on the ground floor and offices above.</p> <p>Charity Super.Mkt started with a six-week residency in a former Topshop in London’s Brent Cross shopping centre and the Fenwick project will be its 15th popup. It is occupying sites in Bristol, Edinburgh, Oxford, Salford and London’s Westfield centre in west London, tapping into the trend for vintage fashion.</p>    <p>The initiative has so far raised almost £1.6m for charities through the sale of more than 180,000 items, diverting 53 tonnes of clothing away from landfill.</p> <p>Wayne Hemingway, the former Red or Dead designer who has helped bring the project together, said: “We are on a mission to get charity fashion into spaces and places it hasn’t been before. Bond Street with all the big brands and dresses for £2,000 is going to be a major experiment. Will people come who have a very different background to most charity shoppers and who maybe have never been in a charity shop before?”</p> <p>While the project’s organisers are not promising vintage designer bargains. Hemingway said the charities would be “putting stuff aside” that they thought was right for Bond Street. “There won’t be the same stock as on Scunthorpe High Street, it will be tailored as best we can,” he added.</p> <p>Maria Chenoweth, the chief executive of Traid, who co-founded the project, said the venture had “lots of offers on the table” for future sites but was keen to secure a good spot on London’s Oxford Street where it could fill one of the multitude of empty stores. She said she hoped the Bond Street popup would be “a launch pad for something special”.</p>    <p>Chenoweth added that Charity Super.Mkt had been offered a spot as part of a project to put independents into vacant units on Oxford Street but had been told it would be up to two years before it could move in.</p> <p>Its organisers hope change the perception of charity shopping as the rise of online marketplaces such as <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/\">Depop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vinted.co.uk/\">Vinted</a> inspires young people to look beyond fast fashion.</p> <p>Long term, the former Fenwick site’s new owner, Lazari Investments, which is run by the descendants of the late property tycoon Chris Lazari, have <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fenwick-to-close-130-year-old-bond-street-store-tm8skbjzs\">said</a> the five-storey building will become offices and retail space.</p> <p>Leo Fenwick, a member of the department store’s founding family who is director of strategic partnerships, said: “Partnering with Charity Super.Mkt combines many threads of our sustainability and charitable initiatives, including helping accelerate the move to a low-waste society with the reduction in textile waste, supporting opportunities for women to thrive, and partnering with charities to improve communities and the environment.”</p>    <p>Interest in more sustainable ways of dressing and the rising cost of living have fuelled a boom in trade for charities and online sellers. Sales of secondhand clothing were up almost 50% to £1.27bn in 2022, according to a report from the Co-operative Bank and Ethical Consumer magazine, while charity shop sales were up 147%.</p> <p>The UK market is forecast to rise by 67.5% from 2022 to 2026, with menswear the fastest-growing sector, according to analysts at the analytics and consultancy firm GlobalData.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In October, a dog died in Portugal. A common occurence. Except that this dog, Bobi, had taken longer to die than any other dog in recorded history. At 31 years and five months old, Bobi was, according to the world’s foremost keeper of this kind of knowledge, Guinness World Records, the oldest dog of all time.</p> <p>Or was he? In human years, Bobi would have been near-mythically old at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/claims-about-genuine-age-of-bobi-worlds-oldest-dog-to-be-investigated\">about 200</a>. His supposed age defies what science thinks it knows about dogs. When Bobi died, he had reached more than double the usual life expectancy of his breed, a Rafeiro do Alentejo. Suspicion has mounted. Pictures of Bobi in the late 90s seem to show a dog with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/claims-about-genuine-age-of-bobi-worlds-oldest-dog-to-be-investigated\">different coloured paws</a> to the one that died in October. An <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bobi-worlds-oldest-dog-fraud/\">investigation</a> by Wired found that the Portuguese government database for dog registration did not have any registration information or data to confirm his age. Bobi’s owner’s claim that the dog was born in 1992 is, as yet, not sufficiently substantiated. His record has now attracted enough scrutiny for GWR to launch a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/16/worlds-oldest-dog-title-suspended-claim-investigated-bobi\">formal review</a>” into Bobi this week.</p> <p>I know more about Guinness World Records (GWR) than anyone ought to, probably. I wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/25/guinness-world-records-norris-mcwhirter-ashrita-furman\">long read</a> for this newspaper about the company last year. GWR controversies happen more than you might think. Sometimes, these arise from the world changing around the book: records that used to seem inoffensive enough start to look different in the light of contemporary mores. The heaviest pet title has been <a href=\"https://www.grunge.com/366744/guinness-world-records-that-are-no-longer-accepted/\">phased out</a> to discourage overfeeding. In 2002, there was fierce internal debate at GWR, the editor told me, about whether they ought to include the record for the largest death toll from a terrorist attack, 2,977 on 9/11, because it might be interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the event. It also no longer awards the record for the largest terrorist organisation, last held by al-Qaida in 1988. There is the occasional cheating scandal. The longtime holder of the record for highest Donkey Kong score, Billy Mitchell, was subject to an investigation by Guinness into whether he was using modified arcade machines to achieve this feat. The company pronounced him not guilty in 2020.</p> <p>But more often, stuff like this happens – occasions when the company, and the rest of us, come up against the fact that some things are just very difficult to confirm. A representative from GWR told me that it receives about 40,000 applications for record-breaking attempts each year, and undertakes a review of this scale about once a year. The estimation of the ages of animals in particular, is a tricky business. Genetic testing can’t provide an exact age. And you’re not going to ask the dog, are you?</p> <p>What might this investigation involve? I asked GWR for specifics. It can’t tell me much while the review is going on. It takes its work very seriously, and it doesn’t want its investigators interfered with. But GWR has a team of people whose job it is to review evidence of records being set, either in person or, more usually, through looking at video footage, as well as links to experts all over the world in fields from neuroscience to potato cultivation, who help it work out whether record hopefuls deserve their accolades. For Bobi, it will be consulting people such as vets and canine development researchers. GWR reckons the inquest into Bobi’s age will take about three months, and then it will either officially crown or dethrone the dog.</p> <p>Does any of this matter? Plainly, by many criteria, no. Yet here we are, in a world where a formal review is being undertaken into the case of this ambiguously old dog, involving dozens of people both inside and outside GWR tasked with protecting the sanctity of the superlatives of life on Earth.</p> <p>I love it. Maybe I am particularly minded, as someone who spends their time writing about things like Guinness World Records, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/05/one-swedish-zoo-seven-escaped-chimpanzees\">an ape escape</a> at a zoo and a weird <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-63155863\">humming noise</a> in Yorkshire, to think that it is good that there are people who think getting the facts right on superficially unimportant subjects is worth their time. Nobody (the dog in question excepted) lives or dies on the result of an investigation like this.</p> <p>So what? Who gets to say what is and isn’t important? Why does society generally agree there is a value in knowing which human being can run the fastest, but not who can juggle eggs the longest? This is the magic of GWR, I think: the goofy dignity of it all. The application of equal rigour to every potential record, in order to build its annual snapshot of life on our planet, from the absurd to the sublime. Who cares which dog is the oldest? GWR does. And that someone does is, to me, beautiful.</p> <ul> <li><p>Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>The drive to commercialise sport and commoditize players can seem all powerful but there is an equal and opposite force in sport which gets significantly less media spotlight yet continues to grow just as inexorably. How to describe it? We could call it the spirit and soul of sport. The intrinsic value that can’t be measured in transfer fees but has a greater and much longer lasting worth. Or simply the magic of sport. It may never be the hot topic on Match of the Day, but sport can never cut itself off from the fundamental human experiences at its core.</p> <p>It’s the reason why we all love to watch, play and engage in sport, whether it’s the battle of the two Lukes in the gripping darts world championship final, Roger Federer’s sublime shots at Wimbledon, or those moments of joy that a crowd feels when watching their favourite team do the impossible in the dying seconds of extra time. We don’t always stop to question what is going on beyond the trophies and titles, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/07/sport-is-not-only-about-winning-it-has-lessons-to-teach-us-about-life\">BBC sports presenter Simon Mundie</a> has written a book to help us understand it more.</p> <p>Mundie has interviewed hundreds of athletes on his podcast Life Lessons. He discovered that it was not the medals that mattered most to his interviewees. It was something less tangible but much more powerful. Mundie has gathered some of the best stories and drawn out the ideas from them&nbsp;in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/champion-thinking-9781526626493\">his book Champion Thinking: How to Find Success Without Losing Yourself</a>.</p> <p>Mundie explores themes of “acceptance”, “unconscious beliefs” and “the joy of losing yourself”. It’s no surprise we connected strongly in the podcast about my book The Long Win. In my own experiences over a decade as an Olympic athlete, I recognised the journey that started off with chasing the medals that everyone around me said were what mattered most soon led to a search for greater meaning.</p>    <p>It’s a story echoed by so many athletes. Victoria Pendleton felt “empty” and “numb” when she won gold at the Beijing Olympics. Andrew Strauss asked “Is that it?” after his side became the No&nbsp;1 Test team in the world for the first time. Tyson Fury spoke of “the void” the morning after beating the world champion Wladimir Klitschko. Adam Peaty described the destructive spiral of “constant chasing”, saying: “I always used to think success and happiness were defined by the gold medal or the world record. I try not to live by that any more.” The England World Cup winning fly-half Jonny Wilkinson spoke of his depression and hopes that the next cap or title would bring joy, but in his own words, “it’s never enough”. Mundie considers what these athletes who achieved the top position in sport were missing.</p> <p>Wilkinson features in Mundie’s book and he has gone to great lengths to rethink sport. His podcast “I Am” marks a journey of self-discovery via quantum physics, Buddhism and philosophy. Wilkinson, whose extra-time drop&nbsp;goal sailed over the bar to win the tournament for England in 2003, dismantles all that we think we know about sport as brutally as he ever tackled his opponents on the&nbsp;pitch.</p> <p>Wilkinson attacks the common cliches that defined him as exceptionally dedicated, epitomised by the hours he spent practising his goal kicks long after his teammates had gone home. He reveals how this obsessive behaviour actually caused huge wear and tear on his body and was driven by fear, insecurity and “a gap in self-trust”.</p> <p>Wilkinson and Mundie interviewed and became enthralled by the philosopher and “spiritual teacher” <a href=\"https://rupertspira.com/\">Rupert Spira</a>. Spira’s insights are about as far as you can get from those discussed on the Match of the Day sofa. Yet Spira offers answers to make sense of sport in a way the scoreline and the endless caps and titles never could for Wilkinson. Spira supports Mundie in his search to find “the true gold of sport”, expanding his understanding of experiences of “flow” in sport.</p> <p>Mundie’s final and most compelling chapter explores sporting moments of joy and transcendence, of inhuman possibility, of a greater form of intelligence, of the universe’s magic. Mundie references Wilkinson’s winning drop goal in 2003, Damon Hill’s incredible drive at Suzuka in 1994, Frankie Dettori’s seventh and final ride at Ascot in 1996 and Goldie Sayers’ euphoric experience of throwing the javelin at the Beijing Olympics. In each of these moments, the athletes use similar language: Dettori says: “I felt like I was there, but I wasn’t there.” Hill says: “It’s as if I was not driving the car, something else was driving the car.” Wilkinson says: “It wasn’t me kicking it – it was a knowing of it.”</p> <p>Groundbreaking psychologist Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi, who coined the term “flow” for these moments of beauty, described this as a “transformation of time”. It’s the ultimate human means of time travel available to us all in these moments. It’s easy to see how we all long for that in our lives.</p>    <p>Mundie’s writing resonates, articulating what I instinctively felt but haven’t always known how to explain. When asked to share the best moment of my rowing career, others expect the answer to be a medal-winning race. But my mind always jumps to a few truly joyous moments on a training camp on a beautiful Italian lake surrounded by mountains where things suddenly clicked and our rowing boat took off, flying along seemingly with no effort even though we were rowing flat out.</p> <p>Spira explains experiences of fans and spectators who feel inspired by witnessing a greater force at play. He reinterprets that moment when the crowd feel deep joy as a goal is scored. He explains that our minds tell us that it’s because a goal is scored and so we associate joy with the scoring of a goal, further reinforced by commentators and others around us.</p> <p>But Spira reads that moment differently. Up to that point, we have been focused on waiting for a moment we want to happen, anticipating a goal. When the goal actually happens, it’s the release and relief from that anticipation that creates the joy. We are no longer suspending joy until something happens in the future. We can freely connect to the present moment. Through being so intensely present and connected, we lose a sense of being separate individuals and feel part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s powerful stuff, a world away from the typical sofa punditry we get.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/07/sport-is-not-only-about-winning-it-has-lessons-to-teach-us-about-life\">Sport isn’t only about winning – it has lessons to teach us about life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mindfulness-based programmes that The True Athlete Project (a brilliant sporting charity I support) bring to elite athletes, coaches, grassroots sports clubs and leaders in sport are sometimes scoffed at. Leaders presume that athletes won’t be interested in exploring their intrinsic values or identity beyond sport or that coaches won’t be interested in connecting to the work that they do beyond winning matches. Yet time and time again, the chief executive, Sam Parfitt, is blown away by the instinctive connection to this approach and common sense of relief at finding what they’ve been missing for so long. The performance expert Owen Eastwood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/19/owen-eastwood-interview-performance-coach-cath-bishop\">described to me</a> his work developing high-performing teams as a “spiritual challenge” and said that despite warnings that players would resist his approach, he had yet to find an athlete who hadn’t longed to connect to something greater than themselves.</p> <p>Sport is a natural context for human innovation. Many athletes and coaches are realising that our physical limits are finite but there is still so much to be gained from exploring the mind more deeply. I hope in 2024 that our commentators, journalists and pundits will also take a moment to challenge the assumptions they are making about what has most value in the sport that awaits us. Mundie’s book offers a good starting point for them to explore this further. And I’d love to see Spira on Lineker’s Match of the Day sofa.</p> <p><em>Champion Thinking: How to Find Success Without Losing Yourself is published by Bloomsbury Tonic</em><em> at £18.99.

            "body" : "<p>According to this book, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;more than 5,000 euphemisms around the world&nbsp;for menstruation. Not that its author,&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Jen Gunter, tends to be euphemistic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/08/jennifer-gunter-gynaecologist-womens-health-bodies-myths-and-medicine\">Once described</a> as “the world’s most famous – and outspoken – gynaecologist”, she is already the author of The Menopause Manifesto and The Vagina Bible – a book that became a bestseller despite ads for it&nbsp;being banned on social media because&nbsp;algorithms flagged “vulgar, obscene or distasteful” words.</p> <p>Language and the naming of things are important to Gunter, and she is clear about her dissatisfaction with many of the terms of her profession: <em>pudendum</em><em>,</em> from the Latin “to be ashamed”, for example, and “vagina”, meaning “sheath”. “The hymen is possibly the&nbsp;most offensively named of all the structures in the body,” she writes, “as&nbsp;it is named after the Greek god of marriage.” Blood is the latest salvo in her quest to wrestle women’s health out of the grip of the patriarchy and give them new ways to communicate about the healthcare they need and deserve. An older term for ovaries is “stones” – because that’s what they look like – and she suggests using it to connote bravery instead of saying that someone “has got balls”. It takes serious stones to cope with many of the side effects of menstruation, and with having them dismissed by a medical profession that’s grounded in belittling women’s pain.</p> <p>The language Gunter uses in the book is a dizzying combination of the&nbsp;rigorously scientific (we’re one of&nbsp;the very few animals to have periods because of our decidualising endometrium); the unashamedly personal (period diarrhoea plays a starring role); and the elaborate analogy. Some of these are more effective than others: it’s helpful to understand that “an ovulatory bleed is&nbsp;analogous to using the tablecloth to lift everything off the table cleanly” while “anovulatory bleeding is a cat knocking the dishes off the table”; but&nbsp;the idea of the levonorgestrel IUD being “the Swiss Army knife” of gynaecology might make some readers do an involuntary pelvic floor squeeze.</p> <p>The book is at its most fascinating when explaining what our bodies are doing and why. The point of having periods (something many people who menstruate have wondered about) is to&nbsp;help humans give birth to healthy babies. But they are a drain on a body’s resources, and they can go wrong. Gunter is evangelical about sharing knowledge, insisting that painful periods are <em>not </em>just an inevitable part of life; that debilitating conditions <em>can </em>often be treated; and that no woman need suffer in silence or shame. At times it veers towards diagnostic handbook territory, but those bits can be skimmed or skipped. Think of Blood as like a Haynes manual for your uterus.</p> <p>Gunter is also explicit about the information she <em>doesn’t </em>have – which is a lot, thanks to the lack of medical research into women’s bodies. Time after time she states that “more long-term data is needed”, and worries about the information vacuum that enables charlatans and organic snake oil sellers to frighten and bamboozle women. Gunter became famous for criticising Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and its <a href=\"https://drjengunter.com/tag/jade-eggs/\">infamous jade eggs</a> – now she turns her ire on social media influencers who&nbsp;sell women unevidenced tests and treatments under the guise of “wellness” – “an interesting overlap of&nbsp;the ‘natural’ movement and the religious right that is rooted in purity&nbsp;culture, not empowerment”. Knowledge is power, she says. And if&nbsp;this book is packed with perhaps a&nbsp;little too much information, it’s because she wants every reader to find the hard medical facts they need.</p> <p>Gunter is on a mission to counter any force that threatens women’s bodily autonomy, whether that’s as old as&nbsp;patriarchy or as new as online disinformation. In a chapter about polycystic ovarian syndrome, she writes&nbsp;“sometimes I just want to punch&nbsp;evolution in the face”. This book will be a valuable weapon for anyone who fights those battles.</p> <p>• Blood: the Science, Medicine and Mythology of Menstruation is published by Piatkus (£16.99).

Previously, Morrisons The Best lasagne had 30% beef, while Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference version had 28%.</p> <p>At Tesco, the meat content of “tex mex” chicken enchiladas had been cut from 27% to 20%, while the pork in the Finest sausages had been reduced from 97% to 90%.</p> <p>Tesco said the recipe for the sausages had been reformulated in 2021, before the inflation rate escalated, and that changes to its products were “often to make them tastier or healthier”.</p> <p>In the dairy section, Which? found the organic dairy brand Yeo Valley’s spreadable butter had gone from containing 54% butter to 50%. The consumer group also highlighted cuts in the pack sizes of some Lurpak and Yeo Valley products.</p>    <p>The Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/21/shrinkflation-youre-right-from-gin-to-butter-quantity-and-quality-are-taking-a-hit\">previously revealed changes to recipes</a> as manufacturers and retailers attempt to offset rising ingredient and production costs.</p> <p>Last summer, it emerged that the volume of olive oil in many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/22/uk-supermarkets-skimpflation-prices-pack-sizes\">popular spreads had been reduced from 21% to 10%</a> and other changes meant consumers were getting a poorer product for their money.</p> <p>Retailers have argued that reducing the size of a product instead of increasing its price has helped consumers. But three-quarters of shoppers said that was not a transparent practice, while a similar proportion said it was not helpful, Which? reported.</p> <p>Ele Clark, the retail editor at the consumer group, said:<strong> </strong>“Our research shows that, while some popular products are subtly decreasing either in size or quality, the same can’t be said for their prices – which means shoppers are inadvertently paying more for less.</p> <p>“Supermarkets and manufacturers must be more upfront by making sure changes to popular products are clear, and by ensuring that unit pricing is prominent, legible and consistent instore and online so that shoppers can easily compare prices across different brands and pack sizes.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Kenvue, which makes Listerine, said: “Like many other manufacturers, we are faced with cost increases, especially in raw material and production costs, and have had to adjust our prices. The current recommended retail price for Listerine reflects these cost increases and our ongoing investment in the product.”</p>    <p>Yeo Valley said changes to pack size had been driven by rising costs and communicated in advance to consumers. Liz Jones, a brand manager, added: “While pricing is set by retailers, we made the hard decision to reduce the pack size to help keep organic [food] as accessible as possible.”</p> <p>She said the recipe change came after testing with consumers to develop a product “where the level of butter and total fat in the product could be reduced without compromising on taste and quality”.</p> <p>Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents retailers, said prices and sizes of all products were clearly labelled so that customers could make informed decisions about their purchases.</p> <p>“Given the challenges facing households from the cost of living squeeze, retailers are solely focused to find ways to limit rising prices for customers against the rising cost of production, while maintaining the excellent quality of products,” he added.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It’s rare I do this when I watch a show, but I had to keep pausing and texting a number of my friends about Masters of the Air (Friday 26 January, Apple TV+), because it felt important to let them know. “Have you heard of Masters of the Air?” I would say, and they would say no. And I’d type out – Austin Butler’s perfect face frozen mid-toothpick-chew on my screen – “It’s like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/aug/06/six-to-watch-us-miniseries\">Band of Brothers</a> but in the sky. Go and watch the trailer now.” And exactly two minutes and 31 seconds later I would get the reply: “oh shit.” And then: “oh SHIT!”</p> <p>It’s Masters of the Air week, then, and this is very exciting. It’s sort of like – how would I describe it? Like Band of Brothers, but in the sky. They got the old production team together – no-namers Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman – and got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/cary-fukunaga-exclusive-interview-new-james-bond-director-netflix-maniac\">Cary Joji Fukunaga</a> back where he belongs, which is directing all-timer episodes of TV. (He takes the helm for the first four episodes of this limited series – the man who gave us True Detective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/12/true-detective-box-set-review\">season one</a> and all of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/21/maniac-review-jonah-hill-emma-stone-netflix-cary-fukunaga\">Maniac</a>! Back on TV!). They threw somewhere between $250m and $300m at it, which always works, and they assembled an unbelievable cast: Austin Butler, who you will remember from sending himself mad playing Elvis in a film that turned out to just be a music video, is one of the leads opposite Callum Turner, who is about to be the UK’s most Googled man. The rest of the cast list goes on for ever, so I won’t get to everyone, but you’ve got: Bel Powley, Anthony Boyle and Stephen Campbell Moore. You’ve got nepotism’s very own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/29/hes-got-the-best-banter-rita-ora-and-raff-law-on-working-with-michael-caine-in-twist\">Raff Law</a> and Sawyer Spielberg. And, due to a quirk of filming (Masters has been in production since 2012; it defected from HBO to Apple TV+ in 2019, becoming Apple Studios’ first in-house series; it was filmed, and delayed, and filmed again across 2021, dogged by Covid), it accidentally cast two of 2024’s ascendant stars, so Ncuti Gatwa is in, as is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/04/saltburn-review-hot-brideshead-soup-needs-more-seasoning\">Barry Keoghan</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA-1JCRguZ0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lA-1JCRguZ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It’s Butler and Turner who dominate this one, though. It’s amazing that anyone just walks around looking like Austin Butler – he is magnetically good-looking, almost breathtakingly so, in an old-school gravity-absorbing way you thought they stopped making in the 50s – and he prowls around Masters of the Air, purring every line into Callum Turner’s ear. Butler plays Maj Gale “Buck” Clevan, and Turner is John “Bucky” Egan, and you think it would be really annoying that they have more-or-less the same name but it isn’t, not even once. It’s just astonishingly polished. The first episode lurches from a flirting-and-dancing and no-we-fly-out-in-the-morning, early-night-sir bar scene into rat-a-tat hold-your-breath action sequence so quickly it makes your head spin. And then you’re in, white knuckles throughout, each time any member of the 100th squadron takes off you feel a low clunk of dread. <br><br>Band of Brothers (land) and its sister series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/04/pacific-spielberg-hanks-box-set\">The Pacific</a> (sea) did the same thing Masters of the Air (sky) is doing: costing a lot of money, having an impeccable cast, being very good, and, crucially, toeing a careful line. It does not glorify war but depicts how impossibly young men dealt with it, then shows the true violent horror in a series of visceral, genre-defining action scenes. In Masters, the action sequences are superb – you are on the outside of a bomber with an engine failing, or you are hanging out over clouds with nothing but a crackling window between you and oblivion, or you are watching Barry Keoghan and Austin Butler do a take-off check-list from the nose of the propeller (an oddly gripping scene: I’d probably watch these two read a phonebook at each other).</p> <p>But it’s the human scenes in between that make you care about who does and doesn’t survive each mission, and they are done amazingly, too: not over-egged, never cloying, just guys being dudes, occasionally taking a sepia-tinged photo out of their pocket and looking at it, occasionally doing a really firm handshake instead of having an emotion, sometimes drinking a whisky after their best friend just died then slapping on a smile. Sales of aviator jackets are about to go through the roof, the most annoying man you know (me) is going to start saying “wilco” in polite conversation, and Masters of the Air is going to be 2024’s first series that you rewatch entirely before the year even ends.</p>",

And with a ‘new deal for working people’, we’ll agree a fair contract with workers fit for a modern economy,” he will add. “Britain is at its best when Labour is at its best.”</p> <p>Last week, Khan announced plans to extend universal free meals for primary schoolchildren for another academic year. He will promise Londoners continued cost of living support because the crisis “hasn’t disappeared”.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, will also address the conference, during which he will reaffirm Labour’s commitment to reaching a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza.</p> <p>Lammy will announce that a Labour government would start urgent diplomatic talks on the creation of a new International Contact Group to take over from the defunct Quartet – the UN, US, EU and Russia – to coordinate with western and Arab partners over Middle East peace.</p> <p>“The quest for Palestinian statehood is a just cause,” he will say. “It is, as Keir Starmer has said, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/19/keir-starmer-says-netanyahu-wrong-to-reject-palestinian-state\">inalienable right of the Palestinian people and the clear logic of any call for a two-state solution</a>. That is why a Labour government will work with international partners to recognise the state of Palestine.”</p> <p>Outlining Labour’s vision for foreign policy in 2024 and beyond, Lammy will argue that “progressive realism” will underpin Labour’s plan to reconnect Britain on the world stage in the face of “the new world disorder”.</p>    <p>“Our progressivism will be built on realism. Progressive because our foreign policy will be founded on our values of equality, the rule of law and internationalism. Realist because we will focus on making practical, tangible progress with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.”</p> <p>On the war in Ukraine, Lammy will warn: “We in Europe risk taking our eye off the ball”, with a direct attack on Vladimir Putin, calling him a “ringleader of a new form of fascism”.</p> <p>Lammy will close noting there is “reason for hope” despite progress being “too slow”, pointing to projections for global heat reduction from 3.5C to 2.4C since the Paris climate agreement in 2016.</p>",

Of the ensuing furore, the Match of the Day presenter said he had received threats. “But it’s not about me. I am not the victim here,” he said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/20/the-levels-of-attack-are-extraordinary-gary-lineker-on-punditry-podcasts-and-why-he-wont-stop-speaking-his-mind\">a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>The former England star, whose tweets in the past have nearly cost him his BBC job, added he was in “recovery of sorts” from X (formerly Twitter) and had cut his screen time.</p> <p>He also said he believed that some elements of the press were “weirdly, oddly obsessed with trying to do me”. “Trying to like, put me away. They take everything out of context. Deliberately. It’s almost like a game for them to try to destroy me in some way. It’s very odd.”</p> <p>Lineker was briefly suspended from the BBC after likening the then home secretary, Suella Braverman’s rhetoric on immigration to 1930s Germany, in possible breach of BBC social media guidelines. He said he was deliberately precise with this tweet. “I worded it very carefully, I always do. Anything that is slightly borderline political, I put a lot of thought into.”</p> <p>He described social media postings on the Hamas-Israel war as “so toxic”.</p> <p>“Everybody I talk to, every single person I know, is going: ‘<em>What</em>? What is <em>happening?</em>’ But the minute you open your mouth – well, not my mouth, but the minute I tweet a little bit – it’s so toxic.</p> <p>“If you lean to one side or the other, the levels of attack are extraordinary. How could it be controversial to want peace? I just don’t understand it. You don’t need to be Islamophobic to condemn Hamas, or antisemitic to condemn Israel. But at the moment it’s just awful. Awful,” he said. When talking about the numbers of children killed, he said: “I feel sick.”</p> <p>Of criticism of his stance on the war, Lineker said: “But I don’t see it as a Jewish thing. I see it as the Israeli government. Obviously, they’re responding to 7 October, but crikey, one atrocity does not deserve 80 atrocities. Or more.”</p> <p>Of X, the presenter said he had whittled his screen time right down. “Before, if I was killing time … I’d just be trawling through social media, getting irritated and depressed by world news.” Those hours scrolling have been replaced by reading – “a lot” – and listening to podcasts by his Goalhanger Podcasts production company.</p> <p>The podcast business, he said, had saved him from becoming embroiled in the internecine world of social media.</p> <p>Lineker also said he signed up to the Refugees at Home charity and opted to provide an “emergency foster service”. He said that two men had stayed with him: one from Turkey and another from Balochistan, around the same ages as Gary’s eldest and youngest sons.</p>",

            "body" : "<h2><strong>Greece</strong></h2> <p><strong>Seychelles, Ikaria<br></strong>One of Lonely Planet’s best-value destinations for 2024, the Blue Zone island of Ikaria is renowned for the longevity of its inhabitants. On an island dotted with spectacular coves, Seychelles beach, 15 miles west of the capital, Agios Kirikos, is still a major lure. It’s a steep scramble to reach the sand, which is indicated by a roughly painted arrow in the middle of the road near the remote port of Magganitis (itself famed for a taverna where they serve seafood fresh from the boat).</p> <p>Naming a Greek beach after an archipelago in the Indian Ocean could be considered hubris to match the flight of the island’s legendary Icarus, but with its white sand, pale pebbles and brilliant turquoise waters hemmed in by hunks of weathered rock, Ikaria’s version of the Seychelles doesn’t disappoint.</p> <p>The perfect base for exploring the island, <a href=\"https://erofili.gr/\" title=\"\">Erofili Beach hotel</a> (doubles from €95 B&amp;B) in the seaside resort of Armenistis has a small spa and a saltwater pool. <br></p> <p><strong>Skala Eressos, Les</strong><strong>bos</strong></p>    <p>Lesbos’s southern coast is lined with breathtaking beaches, but Skala Eressos, a two-mile curve of dusky sand fringed by sea the colour of a jay’s wing, is definitely the best. A couple of hours’ drive from the island’s capital, Mytilene, via a mountain road that corkscrews through lunar landscapes dotted with bizarre rock formations, Eressos was the birthplace of the poet Sappho in the seventh century BC. The resort itself is a magnet for those seeking alternative lifestyles: vegan cafes and yoga and meditation centres line the pedestrianised seafront, alongside traditional tavernas with wobbly blue tables where they serve ouzo with just about everything. The beach is clean and rarely crowded, and there’s plenty of budget accommodation. Comfortable self-catering flats at <a href=\"https://heliotoposeressos.gr/\" title=\"\">Heliotropos</a> (studio for two from €59 in June) are steps away from Skala Eressos beach.</p> <p><strong>Saria, Karpathos</strong></p>    <p>Karpathos is a four-hour ferry ride from Rhodes and a whopping 20-hour trip from Piraeus (the port of Athens), so it’s hardly surprising that this Dodecanese island has remained one of the country’s best-kept secrets. Topped by the mountain hamlet of Olympus, where women still dress in traditional costume, this rugged island is a favourite holiday destination for Greeks, who come here to laze on near-deserted beaches and eat the wild greens called <em>tsimeta</em>, <em>kopelies</em> (vegetable pies) and other specialities.</p> <p>A real Robinson Crusoe experience is available a five-minute boat ride off Karpathos’s northern tip on the island of Saria. This deserted island is dotted with the barrel-roofed ruins of the homes of pirates who lived here in medieval times and its water is so clear that starfish can clearly be seen on the bottom. One of Karpathos’s newer boutique hotels, <a href=\"https://afoti-beach-hotel.business.site/\" title=\"\">Afoti Beach</a> (<a href=\"http://www.afoti-beach-hotel.business.site\" title=\"\">doubles from €65 B&amp;B</a>) has its own pool and restaurant near the main town, Pigadia, from where boats leave for Saria.</p> <p><strong>Xerokambos, Crete</strong></p>    <p>Home to one of Greece’s newest Unesco geoparks, the Sitia region on Crete’s remote eastern tip abounds in beautiful beaches, including Vai, the palm tree-studded beauty that starred in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8S7B8lnOL4\" title=\"\">1980s Bounty adverts</a>.</p> <p>Reached via a narrow road that spins dizzily down through barren landscapes spiked with twisted thyme plants above a glittering sea, Xerocambos is definitely the most dramatic. Its coves are carpeted with golden sands and bathed by seas as blue as any in the Caribbean. Apart from half a dozen guesthouses and a handful of tavernas serving <em>meze </em>snacks, there aren’t many facilities; the only petrol stations are in Sitia, an hour’s drive away. There are no luxury hotels, but self-catering flats at <a href=\"https://aktirooms.com/\" title=\"\">Akti Rooms</a> (sleeping two from €289 a week) are clean and comfortable. <br><strong>Heidi Fuller-Love</strong></p> <h2><strong>Spain</strong></h2> <p><strong>El Rompido, Huelva, Andalucía</strong></p>    <p>The eastern stretch of Huelva’s coast is wild and isolated, populated by a few campervans and people hang-gliding from the dunes. To the west, (towards the Portuguese border)the beaches are backed by condos, hotels and traditional fish restaurants, and packed with Spanish holidaymakers in summer. About half an hour west of Huelva city, El Rompido offers the best of both worlds: it’s a small, perfectly formed seaside resort with plenty of ice-cream kiosks, bars, boat trips, pine-shaded beach spots and affordable restaurants. As a bonus, La Flecha, an eight-mile spit of land parallel to the coast and accessible only by boat, offers spectacular virgin beaches of powder sand.</p> <p>If El Rompido had a boutique hotel and a star chef, it would have topped Spain’s best beach lists year ago. It doesn’t, so thankfully it has remained charming, affordable and a little old-fashioned. <a href=\"https://www.nuevoportilgolf.es/\" title=\"\">Hotel Nuevo Portil</a> (doubles from €74 room-only) is a modern four-star on the edge of town, minutes from the beach.</p> <p><strong>Playa de la Barrosa, Chiclana de la Frontera, C</strong><strong>ádiz, Andalucía</strong></p>    <p>It’s a source of great wonder that La Barrosa isn’t better known outside Spain. True, the access road through the back end of Chiclana isn’t alluring, but the old town and seafront are pretty and the mighty beach in front of it – five miles of fine pale sand, 100 metres wide in parts, lapped by gentle waves – frequently features on Spain’s own best beach lists. While by no means a new destination, it now has added allure thanks to the recent addition of beach clubs, modern restaurants from cheap (<a href=\"https://www.elarboltapas.com/\" title=\"\">El Arbol Tapas</a>) to Michelin-starred (<a href=\"https://alevanteangelleon.com/\" title=\"\">Alevante</a>) along with venues such as <a href=\"https://elcuarteldelmar.com/\" title=\"\">El Cuartel del Mar</a> combining wellbeing, fine-dining and art space in a former military base.</p> <p>There’s no stopping the poshing up of La Barrosa, but for now it remains a top beach and not fundamentally changed. There are still family-run hotels right on the beach, such as <a href=\"https://hostalelcampanario.top/\" title=\"\">El Campanario</a> (doubles from €130 room-only). And even on the busiest days there are still quiet spaces among the dunes beyond Torre del Puerco.<br><strong>Sorrel Downer</strong></p> <p><strong>Oleiros, Galicia</strong></p>    <p>Spain has finally remembered the city of A Coruña, over there on its north-westerly tip, and visitors are staying on to explore its maritime hinterland. While the city has plenty of seafront, the best beaches, inlets and tiny coves lie east across the estuary around the town of Oleiros. This is where locals escape for laid-back, bucket-and-spade summer fun.</p> <p>Santa Cristina beach in the mouth of the Mero river is the longest and closest; further north, As Margaridas, tiny with turquoise water, is among the most exquisite. The 2019 opening of <a href=\"https://www.noaboutiquehotel.com/\" title=\"\">Noa Boutique Hotel</a> (cool, glass-fronted and virtually on the water) consolidated Oleiros’s position as a stylish beach destination (doubles a steal at €85 B&amp;B in winter, €183 in summer). The town’s foodie fame adds to its allure: for classic <em>gallego</em> seafood there’s <a href=\"https://restaurante-elrefugio.com/\" title=\"\">El Refugio</a>, long popular with millionaires, fishers and politicos, while <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lapanaderiabysarah/\">La Panaderia By Sarah</a> seats just 20 in a converted bakery.</p> <p><strong>Calblanque, Murcia</strong></p>    <p>For decades, tourists have flocked to Murcia to enjoy the resorts along the Costa Cálida and Mar Menor lagoon. Now the buzz in Murcia is around destinations with nothing: no Irish pubs, no nightclubs – not even car access or mobile phone coverage. Hottest, in every respect, are the coves and coastal trails of the arid, rocky Calblanque regional park, south of the main road leading east from Cartagena. The best and wildest beaches are in the south-west, after the dirt road peters out close to Playa Larga.</p> <p>Hiking through silence, cypress and pine, with spectacular views of the sea is part of the escape-from-the-modern-world experience. And for those who need to sustain the vibe, there’s now a scattering of simple but ultra-stylish, white-walled, outside-is-the-new-inside, wooden-beamed holiday lets. Lovely <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.mx/rooms/552578097125771865?source_impression_id=p3_1703676775_gmkZIQNj5dOn%2BZOc\" title=\"\">Las Moonas en Calblanque</a> (sleeps two from €120, minimum two nights) is a 15-minute walk from the most westerly of the western beaches, Punta Parreño.</p> <h2><strong>France</strong></h2> <p><strong>Plage des Sabias, </strong><strong>Île d’Yeu</strong></p>    <p>While crowds descend on the Île de Ré, those in the know head for one of France’s lesser-known western islands, the Île d’Yeu. Only six miles long and 2½ wide, it is reached by passenger ferry from Saint-Gilles Croix de Vie or Fromentine on the Vendée coast. Its beaches are quiet coves of golden sand, and none is more idyllic than Plage des Sabias, which is backed by shabby-chic whitewashed fishers’ cabins, with blue shutters and doors.</p> <p>The beach is ideal for kayaking or paddleboarding, and is a short stroll from Le Vieux Chateau, a partly ruined fort that dates from the 14th century. The island is perfect for exploring by bikes, which can be hired in the main town of Port-Joinville. The idyllic town of Saint-Sauveur, with its whitewashed cottages and primary-coloured shutters, will welcome a new hotel-restaurant from April 2024. <a href=\"https://lamissionyeu.com/\" title=\"\">La Mission</a> will have 22 rooms and suites, and a pool, spa, bar and restaurant (doubles from €290 room-only in June and €150 off season). For a cheaper billet, the <a href=\"https://www.hotel-yeu.com/\" title=\"\">Atlantic Hotel</a> in Port-Joinville has doubles from €95 room-only. </p> <p><strong>Plage du Penon, Landes</strong></p>    <p>With wide stretches of golden sand and rolling waves, the southern stretches of the Atlantic coast are perfect for active beach lovers, particularly those wanting to surf or body-board. At Plage du Penon and Plage des Casernes surfers can brush up their skills at one of several surf schools, such as <a href=\"https://enjoyecoledesurf-hossegor.com/\" title=\"\">Enjoy École de Surf</a> (1½ hours from €40) or <a href=\"https://french-surf-school.com/schools/surf-seignosse-le-penon/\" title=\"\">École Surf Côte Française</a> (1½ hours is €45).</p> <p>A mile inland at Seignosse, <a href=\"https://lesmaritimes.com/\" title=\"\">Les Maritimes</a> is a revamped camping village on a site previously called Camping Les Chevreuils. Its accommodation options range from smart beach houses with Nordic hot tubs to more traditional mobile homes. There are also camping pitches beneath the towering pines. There is a restaurant and bar, which offers evening entertainment, as well as a pool and spa, with massages and yoga available. Beach houses sleeping four start at €760 a week in June.</p> <p><strong>Plage de Ciboure, </strong><strong>Basque Country</strong></p>    <p>On the other side of the bay from Saint-Jean-de-Luz’s crescent of golden sand at La Grande Plage is the equally alluring but smaller Plage de Ciboure. The bay is sheltered from mighty Atlantic waves by two coastal barrages, which makes both beaches good for small children.</p> <p>Bigger kids in search of an adrenaline high might try the <a href=\"https://jetsurf64.com/\" title=\"\">Jet Surf</a> experience, a motor-powered surf-board that users can stand, kneel or lie on as it zips back and forth (€60 for 25 minutes). The experience can be booked at Socoa, where a long breakwater juts out from the 17th-century fort – a 10-minute walk away. For a more sedate experience there is wine tasting at <a href=\"https://egiategia.com/\" title=\"\">Egiategia</a>, a sustainable winery that overlooks the beach.</p> <p>The wines are matured in containers under the sea to make the most of the cooler temperatures, with a much lower carbon footprint than artificially cooled cellars. A visit with tasting costs from €10 (45 minutes). <a href=\"https://hotel-lareserve.com/\" title=\"\">La Reserve</a> in Saint-Jean-de-Luz has doubles from €192 room-only; <a href=\"https://hotellacaravelle-stjeandeluz.com/\" title=\"\">Hotel La Caravelle</a> on the Ciboure side of the Nivelle River has doubles from €159 room-only.</p> <p><strong>Plage de la Figueirette, </strong><strong>Côte d’Azur</strong></p>    <p>Near Théoule-sur-Mer, south-west of Cannes and near the border with the quieter Var department, Plage de la Figueirette is a 300-metre stretch of white sand near a small harbour. There are good facilities, such as toilets and nearby parking, as well as two restaurants. It makes a good spot for a cooling swim after a hike among the rugged red rocks of the Esterel Massif. </p> <p>It is also a good pit stop for those driving or cycling the spectacular coastal route called La Corniche d’Or, from Saint-Raphael to Cannes. The route loops between red rocks dotted with green shrubs, overlooking the blue Mediterranean. Villa Les Camélias is a beautiful <a href=\"https://www.sawdays.co.uk/france/provence-alps-riviera/var/villa-les-camelias/\" title=\"\">belle époque Villa</a> at Le Trayas, up a winding road less than a mile from the beach.</p> <p>It’s a new addition to the Sawday’s collection, sleeps 10 (six adults and four children) and has spectacular sea views, from €537 a night in June.<br><strong>Carolyn Boyd</strong><br></p> <h2><strong>Croatia</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sveta Katarina, Istria</strong></p>    <p>Salsa fans descend on Rovinj every June for the <a href=\"https://www.crosalsafestival.com/\" title=\"\">Croatia Summer Salsa festival</a>, which in 2024 celebrates 20 years of filling the harbour with open-air stages and dancing. But about 10 minutes away by shuttle boat is the tiny island of Sveta Katarina, so close yet a world away. There’s no permanent settlement and only one hotel, the three-star <a href=\"https://www.maistra.com/properties/island-hotel-katarina/#/\" title=\"\">Maistra Select Island Hotel Katarina</a> (doubles from €141 room-only), behind which is a pebbly beach with sunbeds, a few cafes and a relaxed, family-friendly vibe. </p> <p>A path through the woods leads to more secluded stretches of rocky coast, with sunbeds beneath the pines. It feels like an island hideaway far from the crowds, but without the high price tag. And the views of Rovinj from here are superb.</p> <p><strong>Šimuni, Pag</strong></p>    <p>Pag’s hedonistic beach nightclubs and all-night dance festivals seem to get bigger every year, and there’s no let-up in 2024. But those not into the nonstop parties of Novalja and Zrće Beach can escape to the west of this island of olive groves and grazing sheep to the village of Šimuni, with its pebbly beaches backed by pine and oak forest. </p> <p>The village and marina surround a deep harbour, but the beaches to the north and south offer stupendous sunsets and just enough beach bars for a gentle buzz. It’s a favourite camping spot – mobile homes at <a href=\"https://www.camping-simuni.hr/en/\" title=\"\">Camping Village Šimuni</a> are right on the beach and cost from €125. Šimuni is about eight miles from attractive Pag town, which often gets overlooked in favour of the party hotspots and is worth a visit.</p> <p><strong>Južna Luka, Ugljan</strong></p>    <p>A 20-minute ferry ride from Zadar is the island of Ugljan, which hides in plain sight of tourists wandering along Zadar’s waterfront. Here chef and hotelier Stjepan Dunatov recently brought life back to his ancestral home by turning the 1912 townhouse into a 14-room boutique hotel in the ferry port of Preko (<a href=\"https://www.dunatovi-dvori.hr/en\" title=\"\">Dunatovi Dvori Heritage hotel</a> has doubles from €117 room-only). </p> <p>At the northern end of this pretty, laid-back island is secluded Južna Luka, which has a cooling backdrop of pine trees round the U-shaped bay. Beyond the large boulders along the shore are vivid blue-green waters that cry out to be explored with a snorkel. A footpath circles a round peninsula west of the beach, and is magical at sunset. There are superb views from the top of Liburni hill, a 20-minute walk away.</p> <p><strong>Brbinjšćica Bay, Dugi Otok, Zadar</strong></p>    <p>With each year, Dugi Otok’s popular Sakarun beach gets busier. But the beach at Brbinjšćica Bay remains quieter, thanks to the very narrow track that eventually leads to this sheltered pebbly cove surrounded by limestone hills. Here there’s nothing to do but swim, chill out and picnic. Kayaks can be rented from the beach’s little shack for exploring two wondrous sea caves, Dragon’s Eye and Gobulinka, just outside the bay. The gorgeous turquoise waters are also perfect for paddleboarding.</p> <p>Dugi Otok (which, at 28 miles long, suits its name of “long island”) is part of the Zadar archipelago and easily reached by ferry from the city. About 20 minutes from Brbinjšćica Bay, Luka makes a good base, and <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/pansion-picia.en-gb.html\" title=\"\">Picić Guesthouse</a> has doubles with sea views and balconies from €110 room-only.<br><strong>Mary Novakovich</strong>Author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-family-and-other-enemies-9781784779405\">My Family and Other Enemies: Life and Travels in Croatia’s Hinterland</a><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p><strong>Gallipoli, Puglia</strong></p>    <p>Puglia’s best beaches are on its Ionian coast: one idyllic stretch is even called the “Maldives”. North of there, the walled town of Gallipoli is less famous than its Turkish namesake but just as beautiful, with a sandy “free” beach in its island old town.</p> <p>Getting there is simpler now: new Frecciarossa trains from Milan arrive at the baroque town of Lecce, 26 miles from Gallipoli, in under nine hours. Sleepers leaving Milan at 9.15pm take longer, but reach Lecce at a civilised 10.02am. There are onward trains from Lecce, but it’s fun – and not too taxing in this flat, rural region – to make for the coast by bike (rent from <a href=\"https://salentobicitour.org/en/our-bikes-0\" title=\"\">Salento Bici</a>, minutes from Lecce station), perhaps stopping for a lunch of open <em>friselle</em> sandwiches in pretty Nardò.</p> <p>Those without wheels might prefer a B&amp;B in Gallipoli, such as <a href=\"https://www.puntacutieri.it/\" title=\"\">Punta Cutieri</a> (€107 B&amp;B) with its sea-view terrace, but a 15-minute bike ride out of town is <a href=\"https://www.tenutaferrarogallipoli.it/\" title=\"\">Tenuta Ferraro</a> (€76 B&amp;B), an agriturismo with spacious rooms, a large pool and home-cooked dinners. Punta della Suina, an area of wild sandy coves, is a half-hour pedal away.</p> <p><strong>Sperlonga, Lazio</strong></p>    <p>Canny Romans like to keep this jewel of a whitewashed town, on its promontory between sandy beaches, to themselves. Italian resorts rarely escape the march of the beach concession, but Sperlonga has five miles of sand, and several “free” stretches, particularly south of 16th-century Torre Truglia.</p> <p>Romans have long sought peace and beauty in Sperlonga: Emperor Tiberius had a villa here until AD26, when a rock fall in his grotto dining room sent him scurrying to Capri. The villa ruins can be seen from the beach, but the ancient sculptures in its <a href=\"https://direzioneregionalemuseilazio.cultura.gov.it/en/luoghi/museo-archeologico-nazionale-e-area-archeologica-di-sperlonga/\" title=\"\">museum</a> (€7, entered off the coast road, Via Flacca) brought home to me what “Renaissance” really means. There’s spectacular but not-too-difficult rock climbing at the <a href=\"https://www.planetmountain.com/en/news/climbing/climbing-at-sperlonga-on-the-avancorpo-di-sinistra.html\" title=\"\">Avancorpo di Sinistra </a>cliff south of the town.</p> <p>Fondi-Sperlonga station is a few miles inland on the Rome-Naples line, and shuttle buses run to Sperlonga seafront. <a href=\"https://www.bbsperlonga.com/en/\" title=\"\">B&amp;B Sperlonga</a> (doubles €125 B&amp;B) is run by friendly Pina and Enrico on a tree-lined street minutes from the beach. All rooms have balconies, and there’s a terrace for breakfast and bikes to hire.</p> <p><strong>Trapani, Sicily</strong></p>    <p>Taormina was famous before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/oct/28/were-booked-until-april-2023-the-white-lotus-effect-on-sicilys-glitziest-town\" title=\"\">White Lotus</a>, but Sicily’s wilder west has stayed under most foreigners’ radar. Trapani is one of Italy’s oldest cities, dating back 3,000 years, and Greek, Carthaginian, Byzantine, Arab, Norman and Spanish invaders left their mark on its old town. The name comes from Greek <em>drepanon</em>, meaning sickle, which perfectly describes its 2½ miles of sand, with gin-clear water. Piazza Vittorio Emanuele beach is central, sandy and free, as is Spiaggia Tipa, further east, and there’s a cable car to hilltop Erice. Trapani is linked by (slow) train to Palermo, 60-odd miles away, but those who come by hire car can also explore the beaches of San Vito lo Capo, Mozia’s ancient saltworks and Marsala.</p> <p>Look out for <em>trapanese </em>pesto, made with almonds, garlic and cherry tomatoes. And if 2023’s heatwave put you off Sicily, think outside summer: Trapani winters can hit the high teens. <a href=\"https://www.lagancia.com/en/\" title=\"\">Residence La Gancia</a> has sea-view studios with kitchen and balcony (€124, including generous breakfast on a top-floor terrace).</p> <p><strong>Scilla, Calabria</strong></p>    <p>Some might remember from school how six-headed serpent Scylla scared sailors into the whirlpool of Charybdis across the Messina Strait. But today’s Scilla is anything but monstrous: the train arrives in Marina Grande, by a silvery beach whose water Italians often rate among the country’s best: clear, warm and multihued. The old town is on a plateau above, with stunning views. The harbour, lighthouse and Castello Ruffo (open to the public) sit on a narrow promontory, and to its east is the old fishing quarter of Chianalea, with its beach, Oliveto.</p> <p>The joy of this area, the Costa Viola, is the railway that hugs most of the coast, and can be used for hikes on panoramic trails (see <a href=\"http://wikiloc.com/trails/hiking/italy/calabria/scilla\" title=\"\">wikiloc.com</a>). I know of SUPers who paddle out from Scilla then pack their inflatable boards and jump on a train back to town. The local speciality is swordfish (<em>pesce spada</em>), which makes a brilliant <em>panino</em> with mild pink onions from nearby Tropea. Again, this is a place for warm days in early summer or autumn, not sweltering August. On a narrow street under the castle, <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/il-porticciolo-b-amp-b-scilla2.it.html?\" title=\"\">Il Porticciolo</a> is a four-room B&amp;B (from €72) with sea views and breakfasts on a cute balcony.<br><strong>Liz Boulter</strong></p> <h2><strong>Portugal</strong></h2> <p><strong>Praia dos Coxos, near Lisbon</strong></p>    <p>A small bay protected by cliffs, Coxos is a good swimming spot when the waves are not too big. Lagoons form around the rocks at low tide, so children can splash and play safely. The beach, which has a cute cafe in high season, is four miles north of Ericeira – a whitewashed former fishing town that is now one of Portugal’s top surf spots – and walking distance from Ribamar, with its excellent <em>marisqueiras</em> (seafood restaurants).</p> <p>Nearby, atop a 40-metre cliff overlooking the Atlantic, is <a href=\"https://www.aethos.com/ericeira/\" title=\"\">Aethos</a>, a swish modernist hotel (doubles from €224.50 or four-bunk “surfers” rooms from €258). It has a heated saltwater pool and a wellness centre with meditation, yoga and hammam. Complimentary ebikes allow guests to explore the trails leading to beaches including Coxos, and Praia da Calada, which also has wheelchair access. The hotel provides surf coaching and a “surf concierge” to advise on the best spots and times.</p> <p><strong>Parque natural da Arrábida, near Lisbon</strong></p>    <p>This natural park between the fishing towns of Setúbal and Sesimbra is a 40-minute drive from Lisbon yet still largely undiscovered by tourists. The Serra de Arrábida mountains run down to a coast peppered with beaches such as Praia do Creiro, Praia dos Coelhos and stunning Praia dos Galapinhos. Horse riding along the shore, hiking in conservation areas, and winery visits are big draws in the park, along with the fine sands and Atlantic roar.</p> <p>West of the park, <a href=\"https://villaepicurea.com/\" title=\"\">Villa Epicurea</a> (doubles from €225 including vegetarian breakfast) is a wellbeing focused, eco-friendly destination with suites and “tiny houses” with views over the Serra de Arrábida forest to the ocean. It also has a geodome for yoga sessions and a natural swimming pool, and is 15 minutes by bike from Praia do Inferno, a small beach which, in spite of its name, is completely calm.</p> <p><strong>Praia da Aguda, near Porto</strong></p>    <p>Aguda is one of a series of beaches strung like gems along the Costa Verde south of Porto. Golden sand, a harbour and a protective sea wall give a more sheltered feel than some nearby beaches, and the village has lovely old fishers’ houses.</p> <p>A seven-mile wooden boardwalk takes in the fishing town of Espinho, which has fantastic seafood restaurants and – in November – a film animation festival, Cinanima. Brightly painted fishing boats land their catch directly on the Espinho beach using a method called <em>xávega</em>, where a fine net is pulled to shore by tractor. </p> <p><a href=\"https://casadagranja.com/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Casa da Granja</a> (doubles from €154 B&amp;B) is a converted mansion two streets from the beach with five guest rooms. It has a pool, garden and library and is a 15-minute walk from Granja station, for trains to Porto Campanhã in less than half an hour.</p> <p><strong>Praia da Ponta da Areia, Algarve</strong></p> <p>Ponta da Areia is Portugal’s most easterly beach, a largely untouched place of tranquillity, very different from the high rises of Monte Gordo a couple of miles away. Between the two, Caramelo Beach Club sells drinks, grilled fish and snacks.</p> <p>Praia da Ponta da Areia is on the Guadiana river, which forms the border with Spain. On its banks sits <a href=\"https://818.pt/en/\" title=\"\">818 Centro Náutico</a> (bungalow for two from €130), with timber lodges, an infinity pool, a restaurant and a tiny beach. The main beach is a short cycle or 25-minute walk away through pine trees and dunes. Hire bikes can be arranged, and 818’s watersports facility, Nautitours, offers boat trips, canoeing and jetskiing.</p> <p>The border town of Vila Real de Santo António is a short stroll from the door, and 15 minutes by ferry from the Spanish town of Ayamonte, where they have tapas instead of Portuguese <em>petiscos</em>. It’s also in a different time zone, so returning passengers feel they have gained an hour.<br><strong>Audrey Gillan</strong></p> <p>• <em>All prices for June unless otherwise stated</em></p>",

          "fields" : {
            "body" : "<p>In my local area in rural Brandenburg, every village signpost offers the same harrowing sight: a pair of wellingtons dangling from the metal frame, often marked with a cross sprayed on to the green rubber. The boots started appearing just before Christmas after the German government, a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals, announced that tax exemptions for farm vehicles and diesel would be scrapped. The boots are supposed to express <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/german-farmers-block-roads-tractors-subsidies-protest\">the farmers’ current campaign of resistance</a> as well as their longstanding grievances. The raw symbolism of the empty boots gets to me every time, no matter how politically wary I am of the protests.</p> <p>In Germany, as in many other industrial nations, farmers have an <a href=\"https://www.agrarheute.com/land-leben/tabu-thema-selbstmorde-landwirten-554007\">exceptionally high suicide rate</a>. Sometimes, as in cases of pesticide poisoning, it is not clear whether work accidents are actual accidents or covert “<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/casetextsp17bpea.pdf\">deaths of despair</a>”, as sociologists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have called the epidemic of rural suicides in the US.</p> <p>And farms die, too. Since the early 1990s, every second farm in Germany has <a href=\"https://www.agrarheute.com/management/finanzen/hoefesterben-zeitraffer-haelfte-bauernhoefe-stirbt-2040-615285\">closed down</a>. Even now, many simply cannot be made profitable, no matter how hard or how constantly their owners or tenants work. Working conditions entirely out of sync with normal standards also mean that very few children of farmers want to<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154508/http://www.agrarheute.com/niedersachsen-hofnachfolge\"> inherit their parents’ professions</a> – if there are children, given how many farmers find it hard to find partners willing to share their way of life. And now the cuts in subsidies: as backward-minded as the focus on fuel might seem, the complaints are partly justified. There simply is no current alternative to fossil-fuel use in agriculture. For your commute to work – still tax-deductible in Germany – you could actually switch to a bus. Not so for tilling your soil. Similarly to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/03/who-are-the-gilets-jaunes-and-what-do-they-want\">yellow vest protests</a> in France, we are seeing a backlash against pseudo-green austerity policies.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it does seem rather out of step for the farmers to complain about cuts. They are subsidised in a unique way within our market economy. On average, <a href=\"https://www.agrarheute.com/management/finanzen/einkommen-landwirte-schwachen-jahren-kraeftig-gestiegen-614005\">farmers’ profits</a> even rose last year. The EU subsidy system gives preference to big farms, as payments are linked to hectares. Those shiny, 10-tonne tractors blocking the roads are worth the equivalent of a family home. Nevertheless, even the winners experience that support system as a source of humiliation or dispossession.</p> <p>The bureaucracy ties subsidies to ever-shifting conditions. It nudges farmers to be more environmentally friendly, and threatens huge fines should mistakes enter their calculations. Farmers are painfully aware, and often secretly ashamed, that their money is not made in rubber boots, but at the desk. According to the late David Graeber, one of the effects of bureaucracy is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/06/the-utopia-of-rules-on-technology-stupidity-and-the-secret-joys-of-bureaucracy-david-graeber-review\">make people feel stupid</a>, and this is most sorely felt in a profession so often stereotyped as primitive.</p> <p>This winter, yearly payments were withheld after a software system crash, adding to the sense of exposure to arbitrary rule. Some commentators find it surprising that farmers should sympathise with Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the rightwing party currently second in polls across Germany, given that the <a href=\"https://www.afd.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Programm_AfD_Online_.pdf\">AfD’s party programme</a> pledges cuts in farming subsidies.</p> <p>Farmers can read all right. It’s just that like many a neoliberal entrepreneur, they hate the state that protects them. The market, however, offers even less security. At minimum, farmers are obliged to plan in a year-long cycle. Supermarkets, often de facto monopoly-holders over sales, set their prices in much shorter periods, reacting to global market fluctuations, making it impossible for farmers to budget securely.</p>    <p>As the relatively fringe association of small farmers, <a href=\"https://www.accesstoland.eu/AbL-Arbeitsgemeinschaft-bauerliche-Landwirtschaft-e-V-88\">the AbL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/landwirte-schlagen-dieselsteuer-ausnahmen-fuer-kleinere-betriebe-vor-a-c6ea938f-3b19-4d06-a155-5a4ac0ca01f2\">has made clear</a>, there would be a progressive way to criticise all this. Smaller farms should remain exempt from the fuel tax, and politically backed price guarantees need to be negotiated with retailers. Even more importantly, there need to be proper financial incentives and legal frameworks for a transition to <a href=\"https://www.junge-abl.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Junge-AbL/PM_22_12_2023_Jugendverba%CC%88nde_jAbL_BJL_KLJB__2_.pdf\">climate-friendly and resilient forms of farming</a>.</p> <p>But this is not how the majority of farmers articulate their discontent. The boots are about something else. What gives the farmers’ mobilisation traction is a grammar it shares with rightwing protests in many arenas. It politicises not precarious social conditions, but precarious property. The cheap diesel is elevated to a sacred realm no one should trespass on, a focus that sheds all larger contexts. As a political theorist, I call such empty entitlement “<a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/critical-times/article/3/1/33/165500/Ownership-s-ShadowNeoauthoritarianism-as-Defense\">phantom possession</a>”, a vengeful reaction to the loss of privilege, as if that loss were an amputation of sorts. I did not ever expect to see it staged quite so literally as in all those looming, limbless boots. Once the cheap diesel is turned into phantom possession, distinctions between those who can and cannot afford it disappear. As does the question of which long-term structural changes in agriculture might make it less fossil-fuel dependent. Instead, any challenge to that diesel is experienced as an assault on freedom.</p> <p>It’s a euphemism to say that the right are instrumentalising the farmers’ protests. With this logic, they are of the right. And they offer something to the right that surpasses the individualised phantom possession of fuel, namely a glimpse of state-sovereignty. Climate activists who block roads by glueing their bare hands to the ground are facing <a href=\"https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/german-court-hands-out-heftiest-punishment-date-climate-protester-last-generation-group-says\">harsh prison sentences</a>. In stark contrast, the farmers have been allowed to pose as though their coup had already been successful. They performed <a href=\"https://www.watson.de/nachhaltigkeit/exklusiv/316622914-bauern-proteste-passierscheine-fuer-aerzte-klinik-chef-ist-ausser-sich\">checks at blocked roads</a>, letting ICU nurses pass only if they could provide convincing paperwork. The general strike that rightwing chat groups fantasised about in the run-up to the protests did not happen. But in brief scenes, it was prefigured.</p> <p>A decent portion of the protesters genuinely distance themselves from neo-Nazi actors and the AfD. Others, however, form the core constituency of these groups. In 2020, a formation of about 200 tractors modelled <a href=\"https://taz.de/Bauernprotest-in-Schleswig-Holstein/!5689633/\">the “Landvolk” logo</a> on a large, dark field in northern Germany. Headlamps formed a white ploughshare; red tail-lights were grouped into the shape of a sword. This symbol stands for blood and soil. The revival of a <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/bauernproteste-in-der-weimarer-republik-landwirte-legten-in-der-landvolkbewegung-bomben-a-ee3611df-e4e2-4064-97f5-619ab69a5ec5\">1920s rightwing terror group</a> took place in the district of Nordfriesland, the same district where economy minister Robert Habeck’s ferry was prevented from landing by angry farmers earlier this month. The police <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/schleswig-holstein/Nach-Blockade-der-Faehre-mit-Habeck-Fuenf-Strafanzeigen,schluettsiel106.html\">did not ask the farmers for their IDs</a>. Appeasing those forces is a very bad idea. But fixing the dire situation of smaller, ecologically minded farms is imperative.</p> <ul> <li><p>Eva von Redecker is a German philosopher and nonfiction writer</p></li> </ul>",

His eyes slide towards me, then quickly back to the road. <em>Gary Lineker! </em>Where the hell are you going? I glance in my rear-view mirror to see his indicator blinking before he accelerates into a speedy getaway. I stop and check my phone. Sure enough, he’s crying off. “Could you do tomorrow?” he’s messaged. But I just <em>saw</em> you, I protest. Thirty seconds pass. He replies that he’s turning back. A couple minutes more and he’s home again, “So all good.” I pass the Mini again as I climb the porch steps and press the bell.</p> <p>Lineker is in a black tracksuit and a little agitated. This is not the TV Lineker of Match of the Day, with his polish and cheeky grin. But then Lineker is entitled to have a scatty home version like the rest of us. He offers excuses – his plans changed; he got the wrong day; he was popping to the shops. He lives in a huge-roomed Edwardian house, once packed with four thudding sons, a second wife and stepdaughter, but empty now. Even the dog is out. But there’s a fire on in the kitchen and he makes tea. He’s not usually in the car, he says. There are only 280 miles on the clock and he’s had it a year. He walks – always walks – to the village. Takes the train or the tube in town. But it’s blowy out, and he had a huge pile of dry cleaning, still sitting on the back seat. As he places the mug beside me, I realise he’s embarrassed about <em>the</em> <em>car</em>. He’s an avowed environmentalist who retweets the Green MP Caroline Lucas and on at least one occasion <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1581935484066238464?lang=en\">defended Just Stop Oil</a>. So Gary Lineker does not want to seem hypocritical?</p> <p>Because, yes, there is also a “controversial” Lineker, who gets into scuffles online and whose pronouncements nearly cost him his BBC job. This Lineker is direct and risk-taking, and vocal pretty much since he logged on in 2012. He proclaimed on Brexit, (pro-remain), on Labour (anti-Corbyn) and has fought the Conservatives on every subject from sewage to asylum legislation. When you have a platform as big as his, he reasons – he has nearly 9 million followers – “You may as well use it to try to do good.” By good, he means worthwhile; earnest. In the course of the afternoon, he covers global politics, the state of the nation, activism. At one point he’ll say – so casually, at first I think he’s joking – that humans probably won’t exist in 50 years. “If we don’t blow ourselves up, we’ll burn ourselves up.” In Lineker’s worldview there are many ways in which we are hurtling towards disaster.</p> <p>Mostly, though, he’s churned up about Gaza. He seems conflicted about whether to talk about the situation, but at the same time can’t stop himself. “Everybody I talk to, every single person I know, is going, ‘<em>What</em>? What is <em>happening?</em>’ But the minute you open your mouth – well, not my mouth, but the minute I tweet a little bit – it’s so toxic. If you lean to one side or the other, the levels of attack are extraordinary. How could it be controversial to want peace? I just don’t understand it. You don’t need to be Islamophobic to condemn Hamas, or antisemitic to condemn Israel. But at the moment it’s just awful. Awful.” When talking about the numbers of children killed, he says, “I feel sick.”</p> <p>Some days after this interview, Lineker deleted a retweet of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), calling for Israel to be banned from international sports events, including football. A source said he misread the post as a statement the ban had happened. The tweet and its deletion caused an eruption of such ferocious anger – from all sides – that Lineker “has received threats. But it’s not about me. I am not the victim here,” he told me yesterday.</p> <p>The more visible side of Lineker’s life was always his hugely successful career in international football. His accolades include 48 goals for England and the fact that in a 17-year career – playing for, among others, Leicester City, Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur – he was never shown a red or yellow card. Football folded neatly into football punditry, most notably BBC’s Match of the Day, which he has anchored since 1999 on a published salary of £1.35m. Two years ago, he made a sideways move in co-founding Goalhanger, the now phenomenally successful podcast company that produces, among others, The Rest Is Politics with Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart, and The Rest Is History. He hosts The Rest Is Football with Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, and the tone is blokey in a down-the-pub way.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Today he starts by saying that the podcast business has saved him from social media hell, being sucked into the ever-screamier vortex of culture war politics. He says he’s in a recovery of sorts from Twitter (now X) and has whittled his screen time right down (although a brief glance at his timeline might have you querying that). “Before,” he says, “if I was killing time like this morning, I’d just be trawling through social media, getting irritated and depressed by world news.” Those hours scrolling have been replaced by reading – “a <em>lot</em>” – and jamming in his earpods to listen to “pretty much” all of the 11 podcasts he produces, in addition to a couple of competitors he won’t name because – he grins broadly – “gosh, I don’t like giving plugs”.</p>    <p>In 2023, Goalhanger shows were downloaded an astonishing 236m times. One assumes that wasn’t all Lineker trying to stay off Twitter. He doesn’t listen to every episode ever – “That would take my whole life” – but “I listen when I’m walking to the shops, walking the dog, commuting, cooking.” He says he’s learned a lot from the drill-down long form of podcasting: “They can go into things in depth. Most of my Twitter posts now are trailing Match of the Day or my podcasts.”</p> <p>Of course, there have been relapses. In one, with the prompt, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1726984161905545305?lang=en\">“Worth 13 minutes of anyone’s time”</a>, Lineker retweeted an interview with the Israeli academic Raz Segal in which he calls Israel’s action in Gaza “textbook genocide”. Uproar ensued on the grounds that the incursion did not meet the strict requirements for the legal concept of the word genocide. Lineker rolls his eyes. “But it wasn’t my opinion. It was [Raz Segal’s]. I thought it was well argued and worth listening to. It’s for others to decide what they think. For me, what’s going on is completely distressing. It’s another reason why I find it difficult to look at social media. Because I can’t bear looking at little children being killed constantly.”</p> <p>What upset many in the Jewish community more than his empathy with the Palestinians was that before or since those tweets he’d said nothing about the Hamas atrocities on 7 October, the hundreds of hostages or the crimes of sexual violence.<strong> </strong>He says he hasn’t lost friends, “I’m not a falling out person”, but there are “associates” he’s chosen not to spend time with because “their views are so hardcore”. Most of his Jewish friends share his views: “But I don’t see it as a <em>Jewish</em> thing. I see it as the Israeli government. Obviously, they’re responding to 7 October, but crikey, one atrocity does not deserve 80 atrocities. Or more.” It’s true, he concedes, that he also has Jewish friends who disagree with him, including those who “have [privately] asked me to try to support Israel on Twitter, to back what they’re doing. I had to say, ‘What?! Look, absolutely no. And nor should you.’”</p>    <p>Perhaps it’s inevitable that with a platform his size, people will want him to take up their cause. In 2016, he was invited to dinner with Michael Gove, so that the Tory minister could sell him Brexit. “There was me and about 12 others, a couple of them with big platforms, that Gove was trying to get on board.” Lineker says he listened, thought “gobbledegook”, and asked Gove if this wasn’t actually a campaign for the leadership. “Categorically no,” Gove told him. “‘There is not any way possible that I would even consider that.’ Two weeks later he’s running to be the fucking prime minister.” There is a small irony in the fact that when Lineker tweeted in favour of remain, many of those politicians who wanted him to back Brexit howled that he was breaching BBC impartiality guidelines.</p> <p>Similarly, all hell broke loose in March when he compared the then home secretary Suella Braverman’s rhetoric on immigration to 1930s Germany. He was suspended for a possible breach of those guidelines and hauled off air. Only briefly, because colleagues, including Ian Wright, Alan Shearer and Alex Scott, refused to perform their hosting duties in solidarity. Lineker was back in the chair the following week (“5-0,” the former BBC director general Greg Dyke quipped). He says he was deliberately precise with this tweet. “I worded it very carefully; I always do. Anything that is slightly borderline political, I put a lot of thought into.” He’d squared this with the BBC “in the early days” when he first got involved with supporting refugees. “I had an agreement that I could carry on with that and climate change because for me those are humanitarian issues and they’re going to get bigger.”</p> <p>So there was no contravention as far as he was concerned when in November he criticised Braverman’s description of an Armstice Day demonstration against the bombing of Gaza as “a hate march”. “Marching and calling for a ceasefire and peace so that more innocent children don’t get killed is not really the definition of a hate march,” he wrote. Last month, after Lineker signed a letter protesting against the Rwanda policy, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, told him that he knows “almost nothing” about politics and to “stick to football commentary and TV presenting”. The Daily Mail followed up with the front-page headline “Put a sock in it, Lineker”. Lineker gleefully retweeted it.</p> <p>It is his strong view that footballers were political long before, say, Marcus Rashford baited Boris Johnson over free school meals. It’s just they didn’t have social media, he says. “Loads of footballers from my day are still political – Peter Reid, Neville Southall, to name two. But where could you have said anything before Twitter? No one’s going to ask you in a post-match interview, ‘So what do you think about what’s going on in Gaza?’”</p>    <p>Throughout our conversation he crosses and uncrosses his arms, his legs, touches his beard, thumbs his nostril, rubs his cheek. He doesn’t suffer from anxiety, he says, doesn’t get angry – “Not that red mist anger, but I get exasperated … and upset.” What upsets him? “Social media usually. Because it’s probably not brilliant for your mental health.” He adds quickly that he’s lucky with his mental health, but as he’s got older – he is 63 – he thinks “more deeply” about things.</p> <p>It’s fair to say that Lineker was not the fully formed political activist he is today when he was, say, a striker for Barcelona in 1987.<strong> </strong>He grew up surrounded by politics and his father, Barry, a trader on a market stall in Leicester, was a solid Thatcherite. While he remembers being “absolutely enthralled by elections”, he was also driven as a footballer. “Focused. Cold, a little bit. I don’t think I’d have been as emotional or empathic as I am now.” What changed him? “Just living,” he says. “Educating myself. Having children. Feeling like one wants to fight someone’s corner when they’re in trouble.” He says any time he was supportive of refugees or asylum seekers on Twitter, there would be one recurring refrain: “You wouldn’t have them in your house, though, would you?” It gave him an idea. He signed up to the Refugees at Home charity and ticked “emergency foster service”. So far two young men have stayed, one from Turkey, one from Balochistan. Gokhan and Rasheed – around the same ages as Gary’s oldest and youngest sons.</p> <p>“They are really lovely guys. Amazing stories. [Gokhan] is literally a rocket scientist – he’s on a full scholarship at Bristol University. I’m not allowed to say his story, but it’s fucking mad. [Rasheed] is from Balochistan. Everyone is going missing and being killed. He came here to study law so that he could try to go back and change things. Which is a long shot.”</p> <p>Next time someone had that pop – <em>Wouldn’t have them in your ho</em><em>use, would y</em><em>ou? </em>– he replied, “Well, actually … ”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lineker was born in 1960, the elder of two boys by Barry and his wife Margaret. He describes his father as “of his generation” when it came to expressing emotion. Barry worked long hours, six days a week, and <em>lived</em> life, as Lineker puts it. “He was a drinker and card player, a fisherman and smoker, but he was great. My mum was more like me, probably. She was chilled. Stable, loving. I never saw her lose her temper.” When he was in his twenties, his world was ruptured by his parents’ divorce. “It wasn’t great,” he says quickly, “because it made my dad very sad. I could hear him crying himself to sleep. She left him for another man, but we don’t talk about that.”</p> <p>Lineker was a bright kid, lightning flash quick in that he ran 100m in<strong> </strong>10.56 seconds. He told Sue Lawley on Desert Island Discs in 1990 how he and his brother Wayne were so sports-mad that when they played football in the garden on winter nights, they gathered lamps from around the house and set them in the back window as makeshift floodlights. If he hadn’t been a footballer, he says, he would have been a cricketer. Does he wish he’d studied politics or history at university? “I’m interested in them now, but I wouldn’t have been at 18. I went to Oxford, though.” He pauses, then smiles: “We lost 1-0.”</p>      <p>Football was always good to him. He recalls the joy of Barcelona from 1986-89: two hours training in the morning, then off to the beach for a late lunch. Home by five; siesta; dinner at 10pm; out late. “What a life! You had beaches and mountains. Good food. Great climate. I remember one Christmas Day sunbathing in the garden.” I ask about the high of goal-scoring and he says, “It’s hard to describe. It’s like watching your team score a goal, but times 50 – a one-hit multisecond explosion of emotion: relief mixed with overwhelming joy.” He’s discussed this with Alan Shearer and Michael Owen. They concluded, sadly, that nothing in life compares. “I mean, there are different pleasures in life – the birth of your child, the kids doing well, success at work. But that adrenaline, that explosion of joy, it’s irreplaceable.” Owen has racehorses, he adds. He’s a successful trainer. “But even a big horse race win doesn’t come close. Nothing, <em>nothing</em> can replace it. You have to accept that and deal with that.”</p> <p>He frowns. Seems lost in thought, and I wonder if he’s recapturing that glorious moment. It turns out he’s thinking about something else entirely. “Don’t you think it’s bizarre, sitting on a horse? Do you think in the future we’ll say, ‘We used to sit on horses, how bizarre?’ because nowadays you see people riding elephants and everyone goes, ‘What the fuck are they doing?’ So even though I don’t have a huge problem with it, I do wonder. You wouldn’t sit on a dog, would you? I know they’re smaller, but I wonder what the horse thinks. ‘Oh fuck, he’s on my back again’? People say, ‘Oh they love it. They carry on when people are not on them.’ And I think, ‘They like running around!’ I like running around. But I don’t want to piggyback Gazza all over the pitch.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Throughout the 90s and 00s, while Lineker was goal-scoring or raising his sons, or beginning his ascent up the broadcast ladder, he was put under illegal surveillance by certain tabloids. Shadowy figures were hired to tail him, photograph his every move; reporters were rummaging through his voicemails. Did he know? “No. Although, before it became public, my agent said, ‘Don’t leave any voicemails. I’ve got wind that the press is getting into phones.’ I never left voicemails. But you could tell that some stories had been written off the back of detail left in messages for me.” He can’t say more on specifics, having long settled his claim.</p>    <p>What he can say is that one evening, years later, he was watching Newsnight when the presenter turned to an item on phone hacking and criminal activity by UK newspapers. Up came photographs of Prince Harry, David Beckham, and then – he sat bolt upright – one of himself. A whistleblowing private investigator, formerly hired by tabloids, related how he’d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/08/news-of-the-world-private-detective\">followed him for two years</a>. Lineker was shouting at his screen, “What?!” “But he was one of the clever ones,” the investigator said, “because he knew we were on to him.” “I was going, ‘Was I fuck?’ I never had a clue. They showed video footage of me on the golf course taken through a hedge. I swear I never knew. The investigator thought I was clever because I never led them anywhere. But I wasn’t messing about. All I did was play golf and go home.”</p> <p>He was married to Michelle Cockayne, the mother of his four children, George, Harry, Tobias and Angus, between 1986 and 2006. In 2009 he married Welsh actor Danielle Bux, but they separated in 2016 because she wanted more kids and he didn’t. Bux is now married to American lawyer Nate Greenwald, with whom she has a daughter, and lives in Los Angeles. She and Lineker remain “best friends”. They speak daily. Aside from Barcelona, LA is the city he most often visits. He gets on with both exes – but Bux is the one that excites the tabloids. He was papped with her in Ibiza last summer.</p> <p>He sits back in his chair and reflects that in this country, “We’ve got a great press and an awful press.” He says he doesn’t know what led editors and reporters to “lose their way” like this, but he has a theory. “Trying to catch people, track people: they had that real need to destroy people’s lives. I’ve never quite understood it. Maybe it’s the same thing that happens with people with power in government: when they start out, they’re not a bad person. But they get corrupted.” The further they rise, the worse it becomes, he believes. “Look round the world – at Putin, or at what’s happening in Israel, the people at the very top. I think it may be the same in newspapers. Owners, editors, they have this power. Often it seems to turn them bad. Not all of them, obviously,” he adds, hastily. “That would be a massive generalisation. But it’s always baffled me. I’ve met a few editors over the years and they seem all right. But I don’t understand that thing about trying to catch people out.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Elements of the press are weirdly obsessed with me. It’s like a game for them to try to destroy me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lineker is now stridently single. He’s dated a bit, he told the Times, but is always upfront about not wanting a relationship. He loves being single, he says to me. You are master of your own time; can do whatever you want. This has included teaching himself to cook, making huge elaborate meals over lockdown, even when no one else was around to eat them (to fully experience Lineker the cooking influencer, let me direct you to his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/garylineker/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> highlights).</p> <p>He suspects that “elements” of the press are “weirdly, oddly obsessed with trying to do me”. Do what to you? “Trying to like, put me away. They take everything out of context. Deliberately. It’s almost like a game for them to try to destroy me in some way. It’s very odd.” I ask whether his growing podcast empire and the power that wields is in any way threatening to traditional Fleet Street? “They won’t like that,” he says.</p> <p>Podcasts are changing the landscape somewhat, he adds. “The genre is still growing, but it’s a real alternative to radio because you can find specifically what you want– comedy, news, politics, history. Radio, it’s always a bit hit and miss. I’ve completely stopped listening to it.”</p> <p>Goalhanger also make sporting TV documentaries, but they quickly worked out that compared with the faff of documentaries – which “might only make a tiny profit”– podcasts were quick and easy to execute. Plus they make money. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/aug/04/ignore-them-linekers-advice-on-how-bbc-should-deal-with-political-opponents\">The Guardian reported</a> that Campbell and Stewart each make more than £100,000 a month, which would suggest company revenues run into millions.) “You say, ‘What about doing a podcast with two politicians, one left of centre, one right of centre?’ ‘Let’s do it.’ ‘Who will we get?’ ‘Alastair!’ You can do it the next day; maybe a bit longer, to get the right people. We’ve learned what appeals [to listeners] is the chemistry between hosts. They feel they know and like them. Episodes with a guest never do as well.”</p>    <p>Two downstairs rooms are filled with podcast equipment: desks, mics, LED ring lights. He says there’s a man cave downstairs where he watches football. This never gets boring. “Genuinely, it has been the one ever-present in my life. Kids have been around for half of it, a couple of marriages and my parents both gone a few years ago. Football is the one thing that’s always there.”</p> <p>He refuses to say how he’ll vote in the next election, only that he’s voted all ways in his life. He’d like whoever gets in to “restore dignity to the country” and reintroduce fundamentally British qualities, such as respectability, decency, kindness, generosity. He’d like to see the return of “hope”. But he fears the election will be fought on “clickbaity, nasty things”, like immigration. The whole thing – the awful press, the bad actors in government, divisive leaders abroad – is a reflection of culture wars everywhere, he says. Without prompting, he asks what is wrong with being woke. “I mean, what is woke? Having a conscience, having a heart, having empathy? How is that a bad thing?”</p> <p>While I can see that he’s vehemently disliked by some politicians and corners of the rightwing press for being outspoken, I don’t fully get his relationship with the tabloids. I suspect he’s a pragmatist, that he has sacrificed the sort of rage felt by people like Prince Harry and Hugh Grant in the name of public relations. He is friends with Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror during some of its grossest hacking abuses, and a regular at Morgan’s Christmas pub drinks. Lineker laughingly describes their spats on Twitter as contrived. “Battling [with] Piers Morgan: we’d be going at each other and texting at the same time saying, ‘Keep it going! This is fun!’ All these things were very tongue in cheek.”</p> <p>On Match of the Day<em> </em>and The Rest is Football<strong> </strong>he is also “tongue in cheek”: the ribbing, the guffaws, the freshness with which he can still experience joy in the game. Somehow, he walks a tightrope between his life as a pragmatist and a controversialist. The serious side that has drive and moral certitude versus a hunger for the adrenaline explosion that comes with a goal.</p> <p>It’s getting dark outside. I’m conscious his dry cleaning is still on the back seat of the Mini. He looks at his watch. “Shops are open, just. If I’m quick.” Best not to suggest the car<strong>.</strong> </p>",

            "body" : "<p>An epic planning battle between the All England Lawn Tennis Club and its neighbours will reignite on Monday when the mayor of London’s office rules on whether to allow Wimbledon to expand on to a Grade II*-listed park.</p> <p>The AELTC, which has been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1877_Wimbledon_Championship\">running the championships since 1877</a>, has applied for permission to build an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/30/monday-briefing-inside-the-all-england-lawn-tennis-clubs-awkward-expansion\">8,000-seat stadium</a> and a further 38 tennis courts on Wimbledon Park, which was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 18th century and is specially protected as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Open_Land\">“metropolitan open land”</a>.</p> <p>The plans, to almost triple the size of the tennis championship grounds from 17 hectares (42 acres) to 46 hectares, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/27/controversial-plans-to-expand-home-of-wimbledon-tennis-agreed-by-council\">approved by Merton council</a> but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/21/wimbledon-expansion-plans-rejected-by-wandsworth-council\">rejected by neighbouring Wandsworth council</a>. Wimbledon Park stretches into both boroughs so in order for the plans to go ahead it needed to be approved by both councils.</p> <p>Merton referred the decision to the Greater London Authority, and the deputy mayor of London, Jules Pipe, will make a ruling on the plans on Monday. Pipe could either refuse the application, or call for a full planning review, which is unlikely to start until after the general election. Insiders indicate that a full review is the mostly outcome.</p> <p>The decision officially lies with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, but he recused himself because he publicly expressed support for the expansion in 2021.</p> <p>Almost 300 trees would be removed to allow the AELTC’s building plans, which some locals described as “corporate ecocide”. The club said most of the trees were “poor quality” and said it would plant 1,500 new trees.</p>    <p>More than 16,000 people have signed a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/save-wimbledon-park-from-over-development-by-the-aeltc\">petition</a> to “save Wimbledon Park” and 2,000 letters of objection have been received by the councils. The local Conservative MP, Stephen Hammond, and the Labour MP Fleur Anderson have also joined forces to oppose the All EnglandAELTC’s plans.</p> <p>Anderson, the MP for Putney, Roehampton and Southfields, said: “I oppose these plans because they are a huge development on gold standard protected metropolitan open land. This will put in danger all of our green spaces in London. Only a small part of the development will be public park and AELTC have refused to protect this from future development.</p> <p>“I urge all Londoners concerned about our public access to green space and clean air to submit their opposition to City Hall on the Wimbledon tennis application for developing Wimbledon Park.”</p> <p>Iain Simpson, the chair of the Save Wimbledon Park campaign group, said: “Since Save Wimbledon Park was formed in the summer of 2021, nothing has changed our thinking around AELTC’s proposed plans. If the benefits to the community are so great why won’t they sit down with us and explain what they are? The scale of the development is too big, as both MPs have said, and the damage to the environment is too great.” </p> <p>A spokesperson for the AELTC said: “We firmly believe that our proposals offer significant social, economic and environmental improvements, including new access to green space with 23 acres of previously private land turned into a new public park. This is alongside hundreds of jobs and tens of millions of pounds in economic benefits for our neighbours in Wandsworth, Merton and across London.”</p>",

But their 30- to 40-minute call on Friday was their first conversation since 23 December.</p> <p>Officials in the US, which has offered staunch support for Israel throughout the conflict, have sought to play down increasingly deep rifts over potential scenarios for the reconstruction and governance of Gaza after the war’s end.</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-said-to-reject-us-plan-for-saudi-normalization-in-return-for-path-to-palestinian-statehood/\">widespread media reports</a> that the Biden administration has reached the conclusion that the departure from office of the veteran Israeli leader is essential to their plans for Gaza and the region.</p> <p>Biden, for his part, in Friday’s call reaffirmed his commitment to work toward helping the Palestinians move toward statehood. Asked if a two-state solution was impossible while Netanyahu was still in office, Biden said: “No, it’s not.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/04/israel-palestine-is-the-two-state-solution-the-answer-to-the-crisis\">Israel-Palestine: Is the two-state solution the answer to the crisis? </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Israel has so far ruled out calls to allow the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority to govern both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> and the occupied West Bank – Washington’s preferred option – and instead suggested some form of governance involving local powerbrokers or clans, with the Israel Defence Forces playing a significant supervisory role.</p> <p>The US president said Netanyahu was not opposed to all two-state solutions, and there were a number of types possible.</p> <p>During<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/violence-in-gaza-persists-as-antony-blinken-seeks-consensus-in-middle-east\"> a trip to Israel </a>earlier this month, secretary of state Anthony Blinken said Arab leaders across the Middle East were ready to help with the reconstruction of Gaza, which has sustained massive destruction during the war, but only “through a regional approach that includes a pathway to a Palestinian state”.</p> <p>White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that Biden had been trying to schedule the Netanyahu call “for quite a bit of time” and denied it came in response to the Israeli prime minister’s comment on Thursday saying he objected to Palestinian statehood that did not guarantee Israel’s security.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/israeli-minister-says-only-ceasefire-can-free-hostages-as-cabinet-rift-deepens\">Israeli minister says only ceasefire can free hostages, as cabinet rift deepens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister’s latest rejection of Biden’s push for a Palestinian state came after Blinken this week said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Israel and its Middle East neighbours had “a profound opportunity” to solve the generational Israel-Palestinian conflict. Asked if he thought Netanyahu was up to making the most of the moment, Blinken demurred.</p> <p>“Look, these are decisions for Israelis to make,” Blinken said. “This is a profound decision for the country as a whole to make: What direction does it want to take? Does it see – can it seize – the opportunity that we believe is there?”</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after a meeting with US mayors, Biden said Netanyahu was not opposed to all two-state solutions, and there were a number of types possible.</p> <p>Biden was asked if he would reconsider conditions on Israel aid given Netanyahu’s comments rejecting a two-state solution. “I think we’ll be able to work something out ... I think there’s ways in which this could work,” he said.</p> <p>Netanyahu is under increasing domestic pressure as concern grows in Israel at the apparent lack of progress towards the “total victory” over Hamas that he has said is the aim of the campaign. Polls show support for Netanyahu’s Likud party has cratered, reinforcing the prime minister’s dependence on far-right coalition members.</p> <p>On Thursday, Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a> Defence Forces, launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/israeli-minister-says-only-ceasefire-can-free-hostages-as-cabinet-rift-deepens\">blistering attack on Netanyahu’s handling</a> of the campaign against Hamas and called for a ceasefire deal to free the 132 remaining hostages held by Hamas, some of whom are thought to have been killed during the war.</p> <p>Biden and Netanyahu discussed efforts to return the hostages, as well as Israel’s shift to more “targeted” operations in Gaza to allow more humanitarian assistance to come through, the White House said. Biden has been pressuring Israel to reduce Palestinian deaths even as he has maintained his strong support of Israel in its war against Hamas.</p> <p>Aid officials in Gaza say they have detected little difference in Israeli military tactics so far, with intensive attacks in the south of the territory over the last 72 hours, especially around Khan Younis.</p> <p>Israeli military planners see Khan Younis as the primary base of Hamas fighters who attacked Israeli towns on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. </p> <p>The Gaza health ministry said 142 Palestinians had been killed and 278 injured in Gaza over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll from more than three months of war to 24,762.</p> <p>This week US senators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/16/bernie-sanders-senate-test-vote-military-aid-israel\">defeated a measure</a> that would have made US military aid conditional on an investigation into whether the Israeli government is violating human rights and international accords in Gaza.

            "body" : "<p>Almost every council area in England and Wales has seen a rise in gonorrhoea diagnoses, figures show, as sexual health services face “unprecedented increases in demand”.</p> <p>With gonorrhoea, the rate of diagnosis has increased in 97% of council areas since 2017, while 71% have seen increases in cases of syphilis over the same period, according to figures based on analysis of data from the office for health disparities by the Local Government Association (LGA).</p> <p>The largest increases in gonorrhoea diagnoses were seen in Wigan, Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Torbay, and for syphilis in Middlesbrough, the Isle of Wight, Darlington, and Redcar and Cleveland.</p> <p>There has been an increase in chlamydia diagnoses in 36% of council areas.</p> <p>The LGA has said that the increase in sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses was partly down to increased testing, but also to government cuts to sexual health services. The high diagnosis rates may also suggest a high number of infections among people who have not been tested.</p> <p>David Fothergill, the chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board, said the data showed that “local sexual health services are grappling with unprecedented increases in demand”.</p> <p>He added: “Councils have been working hard to encourage more people to access sexual health services and get tested more regularly to help improve detection rates and catch infections early.</p> <p>“Investment in sexual health services helps to prevent longer-term illness and unwanted pregnancies, reducing pressure on our NHS and improving the health of people across our communities.”</p> <p>In 2022, the number of syphilis cases in England rose to 8,700, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/06/syphilis-cases-highest-level-75-years-england-gonorrhoea\">highest figure seen since 1948</a>.</p> <p>The gonorrhoea diagnosis rate for England had risen from 80.6 per 100,000 people in 2017 to 146.1 per 100,000 people in 2022.</p> <p>In 2022, there were 2.2m STI tests taken, a 13.4% rise compared with the previous year, according to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables/sexually-transmitted-infections-and-screening-for-chlamydia-in-england-2022-report\">UK Health Security Agency</a>.</p> <p>LGA analysis also found that the public health grant received by councils had been reduced in real terms by £880m over the past decade, reducing the ability of local authorities to spend on STI testing and treatment.</p> <p>In response, the LGA has asked the government to urgently publish the next public health grant allocations for councils to provide an increase in funding for these services.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the parliamentary women and equalities committee will be holding an evidence session regarding the rise of STIs among people aged 15-24.</p> <p>Giving evidence will be Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, alongside the children’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, and Dr Claire Dewsnap, the president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (Bashh).</p> <p>Dewsnap said: “Bashh has repeatedly stressed that, without sufficient investment, sexual health service users will face severe challenges in their ability to access expert, timely care. On top of this, the impact of tendering processes has contributed to a lack of stability in the sexual health sector and a depletion of training which further jeopardises the quality and accessibility of services.</p> <p>“This data not only demonstrates the deeply concerning trajectory of STI infection growth but also the need for a robust national strategy, backed up by adequate funding. As demand for care increases, without imminent action, we compromise our ability to safeguard the sexual health of our nation.”</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This year we have allocated more than £3.5bn to local authorities in England to fund public health services, including sexual health services, and this funding will increase in each of the next three years.</p> <p>“We continue to work closely with the UK Health Security Agency, local authorities and NHS England to manage pressures on sexual reproductive health services and improve access to routine services.”</p>",

But these siren words were used to justify giving the government sweeping powers under the Retained EU Law Act, and<strong> </strong>to do away with any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny of its future regulations.</p> <p>As we saw with the fight to protect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/29/scrapping-of-housebuilder-water-pollution-rules-to-cost-taxpayer-140m\">nutrient neutrality laws</a>, the Tories wanted to allow nitrates and phosphates to be pumped into rivers on the basis this would facilitate housebuilding, something no other country abiding by these rules had found to be necessary. Although this was successfully resisted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/19/brexit-divergence-from-eu-destroying-vital-environmental-protections\">new research</a> shows how, post-Brexit, we are increasingly falling behind rather than leading the way when it comes to protecting our own habitat.</p> <p>Air pollution laws are weaker, chemicals prohibited in the EU are being used here and our carbon emissions strategy is leading to leakage of jobs and gas. Against scientific advice, the UK has chosen to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/bee-harming-pesticide-thiamethoxam-uk-emergency-exemption\">thiamethoxam</a> to be used here, even though Michael Gove pledged to use his Brexit freedoms to ban all such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/uk-will-back-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides-michael-gove-reveals\">bee-killing neonicotinoids</a>.</p> <p>The EU has also <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/endocrine-disruptors_en\">banned the release</a> into our sewers or surface water of chemicals that disrupt the hormonal systems in our bodies; the UK regulator decided the risk of harm wasn’t big enough to merit such action. Applications to use chromium trioxide – a carcinogenic chemical known to increase the risk of lung and throat cancer – are now more likely to succeed here, as our health and safety guidelines don’t meet the EU’s common framework. The impact is not just on our natural world or our health but also on jobs and growth. Companies operating in both the UK and the EU face paperwork from two different regimes – as the smaller market, it’s not hard to see why business is going elsewhere. </p> <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmpublic/RetainedEULawRevocationReform/memo/REULB87.htm\">act</a> wrote into law that we could not strengthen laws if doing so could “increase the regulatory burden”. When I and colleagues from across the political spectrum – from Conservative peers to the trade unions and charities – warned this would, inevitably, lead to the watering down of our environmental standards, ministers told us we were scaremongering. Now the EU progresses towards stronger protections on sewage, fast fashion, protections of habitats and “forever chemicals”, while our government goes the other way.</p> <p>The situation in which we now find ourselves was not inevitable. Voting to leave the EU was a decision we made as a country. It has happened and reversing it would involve decades of debates and division that all those now struggling with the damage it has caused don’t have. However, it is an active choice by this government to use Brexit as permission to treat anything involving international collaboration as unjustifiable – whether on employment rights, consumer protection or the environment. </p> <p>If we want our kids to breathe clean air and our farming and food production to be safe, we need a government that recognises that there is merit in collaboration: the benefits of dynamic alignment of our environmental regulations, cross-border climate crisis action and the north seas energy cooperation to help cut the cost of renewable energy and make reducing emissions a shared priority across the continent. Pints of wine and blue passports will be of no benefit at all if our water is too dirty and our health too poor to enjoy them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for Walthamstow</p></li> </ul>",

This is set against a revolution that is brewing in the depths of the country. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Gladiators</h2> <h2>5.50pm, BBC One</h2> <p>The smashing reboot of the fitness games competition continues with another four competitors ready to take on the new generation of gladiators.

Then, a terrifying new event: The Edge, in which competitors attempt to cross a giant lattice suspended high above the arena. Seriously thrilling family fun. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Michael McIntyre’s Big Show</h2> <h2>6.50pm, BBC One</h2> <p>Having hosted Gladiators, Bradley Walsh is immediately on the box again, succumbing to McIntyre’s Midnight Gameshow prank.

            "body" : "<p>I<a href=\"https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/RC-024496/icon-of-french-cinema/\">con of French Cinema</a> is a surreal comedy about a French film star who returns to Paris after a decade in LA expecting a glorious comeback, but ends up playing a singing hamster. The series has become France’s biggest streaming hit this year, sparking outraged debate about the French cinema establishment failing to face up to #MeToo. And through flashbacks, it tells a darker, autobiographical story about how Judith Godrèche, the show’s writer, director and lead actor, was groomed as a 14-year-old in the 1980s by one of France’s top film directors.</p> <p>“I had to tell this story for the next generation,” says Godrèche, now living back in Paris. “My own daughter had turned 15, she was a dancer and actor at an LA arts school. She was walking around in her leotard, and I had this fear. I thought, ‘What happened to me must not ever happen to her.’ I had to write this for her and her friends. For all the young girls.”</p> <p>Scenes in which Godrèche’s 14-year-old character is steadily served alcohol by adults at a film awards dinner until she passes out, or is shouted at, or made to take her top off on set, have made the series of a word-of-mouth hit and prompted soul-searching in France. Godrèche says she had no allies in the industry as a teenager, no adults ever stepped in. “None, zero. And they’re still hiding,” she says. “People who are still in this industry are still not coming forward. And I’m not here to carry out a witch-hunt, but you might expect a little compassion … It’s bizarre for everyone that I’m suddenly coming out and telling this story. The omertà in the industry is still so strong.”</p>    <p>Godrèche, who was born in Paris and lived with her father after her parents’ separation, began acting at nine. In 1986, aged 14, she was cast in Les Mendiants, a film by the acclaimed arthouse director Benoît Jacquot, then 40, and became his girlfriend. At 16 she put her earnings into buying a flat with Jacquot and their relationship was in the media glare. Godrèche says that she was groomed in full sight of the French film industry and journalists, with celebrity magazines in the 1980s photographing the couple at events, romanticising their relationship and sexualising her as a lusty teenager in “first love” for an older man. She managed to leave aged 20. Jacquot’s agent did not reply to a request for comment.</p> <p>Godrèche chose not to name Jacquot in her series. “I wanted the subject to exist in all its scope and resonance, not to become a niche story about him,” she says. “This series is about exposing a whole system. I thought if I named him, every article would have him in the headline, eclipsing a show which represents the first time I had fully embraced my voice as a writer.”</p> <p>But the success of Icon of French Cinema – a co-production between the US studio A24 and the French-German channel Arté – changed things. It tapped into a moment of painful reckoning in France over the grooming of teenage girls by older men in the arts. Vanessa Springora’s 2019 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/11/consent-by-vanessa-springora-review-a-memoir-of-lost-adolescence\">Consent</a>, about being groomed aged 14 by the then 50-year-old writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/27/french-publishing-boss-claims-she-was-groomed-at-age-14-by-acclaimed-author\">Gabriel Matzneff</a> in the 1980s, was recently adapted into a <a href=\"https://www.unifrance.org/film/56018/le-consentement\">hit film</a>. Paris prosecutors opened an investigation of Matzneff for the rape of minors, which is ongoing. Adèle Haenel, who began her career as a child actor, last year left the French film industry because of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/09/adele-haenel-retires-over-french-film-sectors-complacency-towards-sexual-predators\">“general complacency”</a> towards sexual predators.</p>    <p>Godrèche has received scores of letters from women who identified with her story. “Women said, ‘I’m from your generation, and when I was hit on by an older man as a teenager I thought it was OK because I wanted to be like you, you were so beautiful and glamorous and I loved your movies.’ I felt a responsibility. I felt that, because of me, other 14- and 15-year-olds were influenced to find it normal and acceptable. There was a feeling of guilt.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, Godrèche was sent a link to a 2011 TV documentary in which Jacquot spoke about their relationship. He said that the teenage Godrèche “didn’t give a fuck” and was “very turned on” by their age difference. He said the film world admired and envied him for the relationship, and he found that pleasing.</p> <p>That’s when Godrèche named Jacquot on social media. “The little girl in me can no longer keep this name quiet,” she wrote.</p> <p>Godrèche says that, as she watched the documentary: “My entire body started shaking and I threw up … I was overwhelmed with disgust and extreme anger, and suddenly I understood why I had left France. How could that be broadcast in 2011?”</p> <p>In 2017, she was one of the first actors to speak to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html\">New York Times</a> about the film producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a>, whom she said attempted to assault her in a hotel at the Cannes film festival when she was 26. Weinstein was last year convicted of rape and sexual assault in LA.</p> <p>But many people feel the much closer-knit world of French arthouse cinema is yet to face up to #MeToo. Feminists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/21/emmanuel-macron-says-gerard-depardieu-is-target-of-manhunt\">reacted with outrage</a> last month after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the actor Gérard Depardieu – who is under formal investigation for rape as well as facing scrutiny over sexist comments – as the target of a “manhunt”. Depardieu has denied all allegations.</p> <p>Godrèche’s series is now likely to be sold worldwide. “I don’t want this to stay in France,” she says. “It’s important that it’s not covered up. I want it to be seen by other audiences. Especially because it’s thanks to America that I was able to write it. It’s thanks to the #MeToo movement in America – what happened with Weinstein – that I thought maybe this could be produced. There’s this resonance from what happened in the US, and it gave me strength.”</p>    <p>The story of her grooming, sadly, has resonated with audiences. “I hope it will give strength to those feeling loneliness or guilt like mine. All my life I have tried to somehow free myself from this part of my childhood, and find a way not to look for validation from him and the world he’s part of. One of my biggest fears was getting bad reviews in all the papers that have made a god out of him.”</p> <p>Alma Struve, the 14-year-old actor who plays the young Godrèche – including in a scene in which she has to take her shirt off and kiss an older director in dozens of takes – was surprised that this could have really happened. “It was interesting for me to see how shocked she was,” Godrèche says.</p> <p>Struve never removed her clothes: there was a body double and an intimacy adviser. “In my time, I couldn’t speak to anyone. No one ever even asked ‘Are you OK?’ I found it quite revolutionary today what is possible,” Godrèche says.</p> <p>The series cuts between two eras – opulent modern-day Paris and a darker 1980s France – and has been hailed for its slightly absurd and joyously self-deprecating tone. In the modern scenes, Godrèche deliberately shot an idealised tourist version of Paris which she hankered for while in the US. The British comedian and writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/nov/27/liz-kingsman-one-woman-show-ambassadors-interview\">Liz Kingsman</a> plays Godrèche’s agent, and they messily eat large amounts of food in various restaurant scenes. “I wanted some form of honesty,” Godrèche says. “I want to eat the cake entirely, not take a little bite and say my line. There’s a sensual aspect to it. Let’s not be afraid of what we are, of our desires or our mistakes, or of having needs in this patriarchal world where we’re always making ourselves small. Let’s not be afraid to take up space and have teeth!”</p>    <p>The modern-day outfits are comically over the top. “You’re thinking, ‘What is she doing on this tiny, tiny boat dressed like she’s in Gone with the Wind?’” Godrèche says. The subplot about a Filipino housekeeper, and its final twist, was a true story and the character is played by Godrèche’s former housekeeper herself.</p> <p>Meanwhile Godrèche’s daughter, Tess Barthélemy, plays her fictionalised daughter in the series – but until now didn’t know her mother’s story. “I felt guilty all through my life, and it’s a story that I never told my kids,” Godrèche says.</p> <p>Grooming is complex and needs to be unpicked, she says. “These people usually come to you as protectors. They become a parental figure – in the show you see her going from her dad to this director. I wanted to show a young girl who you see with her father, and then a man the same age as her father. Her mother’s not around, there’s some sort of dysfunctionality.”</p> <p>However, the series’ 50-year-old film-star character copes with modern life with a light touch. “She never had a childhood – there’s a part of her which never grew up. People would say to me, ‘You became an adult extremely young.’ But it was more like being turned into an adult by your life story, society and the way people treated you. That didn’t mean you really became an adult, or that you have actually have ever felt like one.”</p> <p>Now, Godrèche hopes the support shown by audiences in France will spread worldwide. “There is a feeling of sisterhood that is absolutely incredible,” she says.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>For a month or so the touch screen on our thermostat – it’s the kind that spies on you – kept displaying a message instead of the current indoor temperature. The message said something about allowing the thermostat to monitor our energy use in order to increase efficiency, but I never read it all the way through. The message was accompanied by a button underneath that said “OK”. I ignored it, thinking: no good can come of this.</p> <p>Then one day my wife decided she wanted to know what the temperature was. She went over to the thermostat and saw the message.</p> <p>“What’s this?” she said.</p> <p>“An offer to monitor our energy use,” I said.</p> <p>“How do I get rid of it?” she said.</p> <p>“I’m not sure,” I said, “but whatever you do, don’t press …” I watched as my wife pressed OK.</p> <p>After a week of monitoring, the thermostat appeared to reach the conclusion that no one lived in our house, and imposed a corresponding heating regime: basically just enough to keep the pipes from freezing. At first we don’t notice, because the weather is unseasonably warm. Then suddenly it isn’t.</p> <p>“This says it’s 9C in here!” my wife shouts, standing before the thermostat with her hands tucked in her armpits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My office shed, which is heated by a small, inadequate electric radiator, is suddenly the most comfortable place to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I wish I had the technical expertise to explain why this is all your fault,” I say.</p> <p>“We can’t live like this,” she says.</p> <p>“Fortunately,” I say, “you can just override the system by turning the dial clockwise.”</p> <p>“Oh,” she says, turning the thermostat up to 20C. “That’s all right then.”</p> <p>“Unfortunately,” I say, “as soon as it reaches the next programmed adjustment in the schedule, it will go back.”</p> <p>“Fix it!” she says.</p> <p>“Luckily, I have the app on my phone, so I can edit the schedule at will, from anywhere.”</p> <p>“Yes, please,” she says.</p> <p>“Sadly,” I say, “the thermostat has mysteriously disconnected itself from the wifi, and now refuses to acknowledge that we even have wifi.”</p> <p>“There must be something we can do,” she says.</p> <p>“We can move house,” I say, “but we shouldn’t show prospective buyers round on cold mornings.”</p> <p>The cat and the dog follow me from room to room, thinking: he must be heading somewhere warmer. Only the tortoise is content. He has achieved a state of suspended animation normally denied him by the kitchen’s underfloor heating, and spends his days lying motionless, butted up against the washing machine. I’m envious of this approach to winter: the next time he knows anything, it will be mid-March.</p> <p>My office shed, which is heated by a small and wholly inadequate electric radiator, is suddenly the most comfortable place to be. I rise early just to get out there. In my wife’s office – formerly the middle one’s bedroom – the radiator is stone cold. She wears a coat while she works, and comes out to my shed three times a day to complain.</p> <p>“It’s lovely in here,” she says, sitting down.</p> <p>“Ooh, snow,” I say, looking out the window.</p> <p>“Perhaps I could come out here and work with you,” she says.</p> <p>“Someone needs to be inside,” I say, “turning the thermostat back up whenever it turns itself down.”</p> <p>“I’ve done it four times today,” she says. “It doesn’t help.”</p> <p>“That’s weird,” I say.</p> <p>I follow her back into the house to investigate. The thermostat is, for the moment, still set to 20C. The radiators at the back of the house are all on, but the radiators at the front of the house are cold. This forces me to reconfigure my mental picture of our central heating’s plumbing, which I always imagined to be like a chain spiralling upwards, on which radiators were strung at intervals like beads.</p> <p>Now I must consider the possibility that it’s more like a log flume – rising steeply at the back of the house, cascading down at the front, and blocked somewhere near the apex. Or maybe there are two distinct branches, one operative, one failing. Either way, this no longer seems like something I can blame on my wife’s button-pressing.</p> <p>“I now believe there is more than one thing wrong with our heating,” I tell my wife.</p> <p>“Are you about to explain both of them to me?” she says.</p> <p>“Yes,” I say. “The first is the unfeeling intransigence of our robot thermostat.”</p> <p>“The second is a plumbing issue caused by the rash installation of a heated towel rail in the bathroom.”</p> <p>“There was already a heated towel rail there,” my wife says. “It just didn’t work.”</p> <p>“Honestly, the sheer hubris of it,” I say. “What’s wrong with room temperature towels?”</p> <p>“If it’s the plumbing I’ll call Mark to fix it. What should I tell him?”</p> <p>“Please don’t tell him anything I just said,” I say.</p>",

The scenes in Gaza were too raw, and the geopolitical consequences for the conflict too vast, to remain confined within its borders.</p> \n<p>Last weekend, four waves of US missile strikes, some involving the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/houthi-leader-it-is-a-great-honour-to-be-in-direct-confrontation-with-israel-the-us-and-the-uk\">hit the ports and inland strongholds of the Houthis</a> in Yemen.

By Tuesday, Iran had broken new ground by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/16/iran-claims-it-has-attacked-an-israeli-spy-base-in-kurdistan\">striking Jaish al-Adl</a>, a Sunni separatist group operating in Pakistan close to Iran’s border. The group was responsible not for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/dead-in-blasts-at-memorial-for-assassinated-iranian-commander\">suicide bombing in Kerman</a> on 3 January that killed more than 80 people at a ceremony marking the assassination of the Revolutionary Guards leader Qassem Suleimani, but instead for the killing in December of 11 police officers in the Iranian city of Rask, in the south-eastern province of Sistan-Balochistan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2023/09/interactive-generic-ai2html-scrolly/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"spreadsheet-data\"> <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-gv-scrollykey=&quot;1LQ92hJZP1Rl7MTXeNGNDAvrJrw4eTXQPMWJS3ZczfrY&quot;></div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike Iraq, Pakistan was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/pakistan-launches-retaliatory-strikes-in-iran-aimed-at-separatist-militant-group\">prepared to respond</a>. Within 48 hours its forces said it “successfully struck hideouts used by terrorist organisations, namely Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front in Iran itself”. It pointed out it had warned Iran for years about its ungoverned spaces threatening Pakistan.</p> \n<p>All the while, Hezbollah and Israel exchanged now familiar rocket fire on the southern Lebanese border, so much so that the Israeli chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, admitted the possibility of all-out war was increasing.</p> \n<p>Gaza’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/16/no-food-no-water-no-heating-famine-exists-in-gaza-say-officials\">looming famine</a> and the spread of hepatitis A were temporarily turned into a sideshow.</p> \n<p>Not every dot in the Middle East can be joined. Not all these conflicts are connected, or have their precise roots in Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, and some will be doused. But they at least blend, in part because they reveal a collective erosion of self-restraint and the rule of law. Iran and Pakistan, for instance, behaved – as has the US – as if they had a unilateral right to pursue counter-terrorism operations across national borders.</p> \n<p>Iran may also have been sending a reminder to the US and Israel that it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/13/iran-is-thwith-china-and-russia-behind-it-iran-is-the-big-kid-on-the-block\">the capability and political will</a> not just to support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/06/middle-east-crisis-grows-does-iran-have-control-proxy-forces\">its numerous allies</a>, but to strike anywhere if it feels its national integrity is under threat, whether from Kurds, Sunnis or Balochs. Facing spring elections in which the turnout will matter more than the result, the regime displayed its determination to defeat threats to national unity.</p> \n<p>Vali Nasr, a professor of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University, told the World Economic Forum in Davos this week there might be a wider motive linking back to Gaza.</p> \n<p>“Iran and Hezbollah do not want Israel and the US to dictate the pace of the Gaza war; for Israel to finish Gaza on its own schedule and then decide what they are going to do with Hezbollah, and then the Houthis, and to decide what is the end game,” he said. “Iran and Hezbollah want to deny Israel and the US a chance to dictate the new order that is going to emerge in the Middle East, and they are opening as many fronts at the same time to deny them that capability.”</p> \n<p>In striking as it did, Tehran took risks, alienating its allies Iraq and Pakistan, and underlining the divisions in the forces opposed to US support for Israel.</p> \n<p>For instance, Khalid al-Yaqobi, a security adviser to the Iraqi prime minister, insisted no Mossad spy headquarters existed in Erbil. The attack, he said was an attempt by Iranian intelligence to mislead the Iranian leadership, and cover up its failure to prevent the Kerman attack.</p> \n<p>With Iraq’s parliament closer than ever to ordering the US to remove its remaining 2,500 troops and close its military bases in the country – Iran’s great goal in Iraq – the attack on Erbil, repeating a similar episode in 2022, will only make the Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, more nervous that a US departure will leave his country at the mercy of Tehran.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the attack in Pakistan gave Islamabad the chance to highlight how it had repeatedly complained to Tehran about its ungoverned spaces. The very fact that its airstrike inside Iran killed nine Pakistanis proved Islamabad’s point.</p> \n<p>Iran, in response, argues the scale of its strikes, choice of targets, and diplomatic fallout shows the attacks did not constitute an escalation against the US, Israel or even Pakistan. Nothing Iran did removed any of the security buffers designed to prevent a direct conflict with the US over Gaza, it said.</p> \n<p>However, the former head of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign relations committee, Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, told Iran Watch that the attacks were shocking and badly timed. Iran was one of the most aggressive countries in the world and this was because diplomats were marginalised in government.</p> \n<p>He said the true slope down to war remained in the Middle East, not on the Pakistan-Iran border. Moreover, the longer these pockets of war multiply in Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon, the greater the likelihood that each conflict becomes more intractable, deadly and contagious.</p> \n<p>In Davos, with the world seemingly falling apart around them, Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan, the US secretary of state and national security adviser respectively, sounded short of new solutions, returning yet again to their pet theme of normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Israel. This despite the Saudis, including their London ambassador, Prince Khalid bin Bandar, having said repeatedly since 7 October that it cannot happen without a pathway to a two-state solution.</p> \n<p>In a further rebuff to Blinken’s diplomacy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/netanyahu-tells-us-opposes-palestinian-state-after-gaza-war\">Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the idea</a> on Thursday, telling a press conference: “In any arrangement in the foreseeable future – with an arrangement or without one – Israel must have security control over all the territory west of the Jordan,” referring to the occupied territories that Palestinians intend to become an independent state.</p> \n<p>Leaks concerning Washington’s frustration with the Israeli prime minister proliferate, but Netanyahu is impervious.</p> \n<p>In London, at an event marking three months since the war began, the Palestinian ambassador Husam Zomlot, argued that Netanyahu, in a battle for political survival, was looking for chances to spread the conflict. Against such an explosive backdrop, he said, it was a dangerous failure of leadership for the US and the UK to defend the siege of Gaza, even though they did not share the objectives of the leader imposing that siege.</p> \n<p>“The fact is that the US is the biggest political, legal, material, military backer of Israel,” Zomlot said. “Almost all of Israel’s weapons, including all these 2,000lb bombs that are falling on the heads of our families, are American. So either America doesn’t use its leverage, or doesn’t know how to use its leverage.”</p> \n<p>Even after this tumultuous week, few signs have emerged that Biden has any intention of changing course.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The health secretary, Victoria Atkins, has been accused of failing to ensure the supply of the only drug that can lengthen the lives of motor neurone disease sufferers by months despite officials being alerted to a shortage last autumn.</p> <p>Shortages of riluzole, which can delay the onset of ventilator dependence, were first reported to the Motor Neurone Disease Association by sufferers in August and the situation was flagged to the Department of Health and Social Care in September.</p> <p>Despite claims from the DHSC during a phone call in December that the pharmaceutical company Glenmark had agreed to rush more of the drug on to the UK market, people with the terminal disease are still reporting a lack of riluzole 50mg tablets in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, according to the MND Association.</p> <p>Atkins, who was appointed to her role in November when the government passed through its latest reshuffle after the sacking of the then home secretary, Suella Braverman, is said to have failed to respond to a letter sent in December by the MND Association’s chief executive, Tanya Curry.</p> <p>DHSC officials are also said to have not responded to two later emails seeking further information amid growing panic among those with motor neurone disease, which progressively damages parts of the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting, and death. MND affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. Life expectancy after diagnosis is one to five years.</p> <p>The MND Association says newly diagnosed patients seeking to extend their lives for a few additional months are being denied their only medication option due to the lack of available supply. It said: “People with MND certainly should not have to spend their precious days fighting to get the medication they deserve.”</p> <p>For the last three months of 2023, there were also shortages of hyoscine hydrobromide 1.5mg patches, which are used by people with MND to control drooling.</p> <p>Alex Massey, the head of campaigning, policy and public affairs at the MND Association, said there was a discrepancy between the government’s claims that the issue was being dealt with and the experience of people looking for riluzole.</p> <p>He said: “Since last autumn, people living with MND have reported being unable to fill their prescriptions for riluzole, the only drug available to treat the condition.</p> <p>“We have raised this issue repeatedly with the Department of Health and Social Care, but they have so far been unable to provide clarity on the cause of the ongoing supply issues, nor to provide a solution. The department must act urgently to ensure that everyone living with MND can access the medication they need and are entitled to.”</p> <p>Massey added that there had been no alleviation of the situation since officials had claimed new supplies were entering the market.</p> <p>He said: “We continue to have people getting in touch saying they can’t fill their prescriptions. Pharmacists are continuing to see [supplies] out of stock and being unable to order supplies when they try to order.</p> <p>“We’ve been in touch with Community Pharmacy England; I spoke to them again only last week. They said they’re continuing to see the problems this month, continuing to hear reports from pharmacists of shortages. So it’s a confusing situation really: we’re told on the one hand by the Department of Health that more supplies have been released, but we’re not seeing improvements on the ground in terms of people’s experiences.</p> <p>“Since going back to the Department of Health to ask about this discrepancy as to what’s going on, we’ve had nothing back from them at all since Christmas, despite going back to them a couple of times at least this month.”</p> <p>Martin Imms,<strong> </strong>senior director and country manager for the pharmaceutical company Glenmark, said: “A number of manufacturers have withdrawn from the UK market – that has led to a shortage of stock in the UK. This issue was flagged to us by the DHSC, following which we have worked hard with various teams internally including our integrated supply function to meet this product demand.</p> <p>“As a global organisation with a commercial presence across 80 countries, we have to balance multiple competing interests and coupled with our finite supply capabilities, this took us some time to resolve.</p> <p>“We are pleased to have managed to secure more [active pharmaceutical ingredients] and increase production capacity and have subsequently fast-tracked finished product from our manufacturing site in India to the UK.</p> <p>“We should now be in a position to support the full market volume demand for the foreseeable future and will continue to work closely with the DHSC to monitor the situation and mitigate the impact of any subsequent issues arising.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/14/nhs-medicines-shortage-putting-lives-at-risk-pharmacists-warn\">NHS medicines shortage putting lives at risk, pharmacists warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this week the Guardian revealed that figures collated by the British Generic Manufacturers Association showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/14/nhs-medicines-shortage-putting-lives-at-risk-pharmacists-warn\">the number of medicines where shortages were being reported had doubled</a> over the last two years. The DHSC said it did not recognise the figures.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the DHSC said it had scheduled a call with the MND Association for next Wednesday.</p> <p>He said: “We understand how frustrating and distressing medication shortages can be and are aware of an issue with one supplier of riluzole.</p> <p>“Alternative suppliers have confirmed they have stock available and can meet demand and we continue to work with manufacturers to help ensure patients with motor neurone disease can continue to access the medicines they need.</p> <p>“We are determined to improve the lives of people with MND. That’s why, in November 2021, we committed to spend at least £50m on MND research over five years to support cutting-edge research and enable faster progress towards treatments.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When you make a roast, fry bacon or grill burgers, an umami-rich, nourishing but often wasted ingredient called tallow, lard or schmaltz magically renders from the meat during the cooking. This free ingredient can be used instead of butter or oil in just about any savoury dish and, depending on the type, age and quality of the meat you use, its flavour will range from mild to intensely meaty. Lamb, mutton and beef fat have a very high smoke point between 200C and 205C, which makes them a great choice for cooking food at high temperatures, be that chips, roast potatoes or popcorn. For my tallow popcorn, I saved the fat from two grass-fed burgers, which yielded just over a tablespoon and a half of fat, plenty to pop a bowl of corn for two. The flavour was rich, savoury and, once seasoned with mustard powder and smoked sea salt, tasted remarkably like meat-flavoured crisps.</p> <h2>Tallow popcorn</h2> <p>Popcorn pops at 180C, so it’s important to use a fat with a relatively high smoke point. Lamb tallow popcorn is admittedly a bit of an acquired taste, but all dedicated lamb lovers out there, myself included, will enjoy it, I’m sure, perhaps seasoned with mustard powder or even grated horseradish and garlic powder.</p> <p>When any fat (plant- or animal-based) smokes, its flavour is destroyed and its chemical composition changes, breaking down free fatty acids and releasing free radicals and other harmful compounds you really don’t want to be eating. Using a fat with a high smoke point reduces those risks – just keep an eye on a pan and adjust the temperature as needed. You will know the fat is getting too hot if the ingredients start to spit and frazzle.</p> <p>Poultry fat, including chicken, duck and goose, has a smoke point of 190C, while pork fat has a lower smoke point of 185C, so if you use any of these fats, whether in a pan or in the oven, keep the temperature lower than that so they don’t burn. Their lower smoke point means it’s best not to use them to cook popcorn, but they can still be used to flavour popcorn by heating them up and drizzling them over the popped kernels, much as you might toss them in seasoned butter. Chicken schmaltz, for example, is particularly delicious on popcorn, with nothing more than a little sea salt.</p> <p>Two tablespoons of popcorn kernels should make a suitable portion of about three cups of popcorn. Choose the right sized pan for the number of portions you want to make – as a general rule, the pan needs to be wide enough so the popcorn sits no more than a layer on the base, giving as many of the kernels as possible a chance to pop successfully.</p> <p>Serves <strong>2</strong> </p> <p><strong>2 tbsp tallow</strong>, or another high smoke point fat such as ghee, organic rapeseed oil or sunflower oil<br><strong>4 tbsp popcorn kernels</strong> (enough to make about 6 cups)</p> <p>To serve (all optional and added to taste)<br><strong>Sea salt</strong> <strong>or smoked sea salt</strong><br><strong>Mustard powder, smoked paprika or grated horseradish</strong><br><strong>Garlic powder</strong></p> <p>Put a suitably sized and ideally thick-based pan on a medium-high heat. Add the tallow (or other fat) and leave it to heat up and melt. Add the popcorn kernels, cover the pan with a lid and wait until you hear the corn start to pop. Give the pan a little shake, to agitate the corn a bit, and listen again. After a couple of minutes, when the pops slow down to just one every 20 seconds or so, carefully lift off the lid to check the popcorn is done. As soon as it’s ready, pour it straight into a bowl so it doesn’t catch and burn.</p> <p>Season the hot corn to taste, and serve – tallow popcorn pairs especially well with smoked sea salt and perhaps a very light dusting of mustard powder, horseradish or hot smoked paprika, if you like things spicy.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->",

We seldom see them. They have a talent for hiding behind tree trunks when there are people around. What usually follows can often be a game of hide-and-seek, unless I’m with an accomplice who walks around the tree and bamboozles the bird into breaking cover.</p> <p>But this hungry bird, approaching with characteristic woodpecker-riding-a-rollercoaster undulating flight, had no such inhibitions. She was carrying a spruce cone in her beak and landed in full view, on the trunk of a sallow. Then she wedged the cone into a hole she had already excavated, using that as a vice while she chiselled out the seeds. Later we found scores of discarded, hacked-about Sitka cones under her workbench.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/a-z-of-british-trees/sitka-spruce/\">Sitka spruce</a> – a fast-growing north American tree, generally unloved by the British public<strong> </strong>for perhaps understandable reasons – will forever be associated with dense forestry plantations blanketing upland landscapes, perceived to be devoid of wildlife. Some can be so, but I&nbsp;have also seen the whole 40-year planting and felling rotation, and in their early and final years these plantations can make for good wildlife habitat. The late <a href=\"https://www.treeregister.org/about-us/our-patrons-and-trustees/\">Alan Mitchell</a> – naturalist and doyen of dendrologists – was also an admirer. He described it as a tree with glamour, one of an elite group of conifer species capable of growing to a height of over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picea_sitchensis\">300 feet</a> in their native Pacific Northwest forests.</p> <p>Veteran specimens can reach <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/trees-and-shrubs/sitka-spruce\">200 feet in Britain</a>, but this plantation, supplying our woodpecker with winter provisions, is nearing the end of its rotation and is destined to be felled long before its trees realise their growth potential. Nevertheless, this year it has produced a magnificent cone crop, clustered at the topmost branches, where we caught a glimpse of a restless flock of small birds. Could they be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/24/country-diary-drifting-wrappers-and-thudding-pine-cones-mean-only-one-thing\">crossbills</a>?</p> <p>We stood at the edge of the plantation, with the feeding party overhead, and waited until a cone came bouncing down through the branches. Some of its scales showed tell-tale ragged splits along their length. Crossbills are specialists in extracting conifer seeds, with a beak whose mandibles overlap like scissor blades, splitting cone scales and levering them apart. Their nesting season begins in late winter. This plantation <a href=\"https://community.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/b/science/posts/the-use-of-spruce-a-crossbill-s-perspective\">could feed them</a> during the cold months to come.</p> <p>• Country diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>",

Both extend across 3% of Cyprus’s land mass, or 98 sq miles.</p> <p>Although never confirmed, EU diplomats in Nicosia, the island’s war-split capital, say US forces are present on the military installation. “If you look over the fence at Akrotiri you’ll see US military surveillance and other aircraft,” one said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/cyprus-zip/giv-13425E5QIbsEZw0s6\" data-alt=\"Cyprus\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/cyprus-zip/giv-13425E5QIbsEZw0s6\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>On Tuesday, the Cyprus government’s spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis, emphasised the eastern Mediterranean island was not involved in any military operations, intimating that under the bases’ treaty of establishment, the UK was not obliged to inform Cypriot authorities about activity in the facilities. “The government is in constant communication with the UK within the framework established in relation to the bases’ use,” he said.</p> <p>Protests mounted last week after RAF Akrotiri was used as a launch pad for Typhoon fighter jets conducting targeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/12/us-uk-air-strikes-yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-crisis\">airstrikes on Houthi strongholds in Yemen</a> in retaliation for attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The pro-Palestinian militia has justified its assaults – with one of its missiles recently hitting a Greek-owned cargo ship – by saying it was acting in response to Israel’s ongoing offensive.</p> <p>In an apparent attempt to calm nerves in Cyprus, the British defence minister, Grant Shapps, was on the island on Friday meeting the president. “We want to do everything possible to ensure the security of Cyprus, which is in everyone’s best interests. We appreciate that you are in a difficult neighbourhood and want to do everything possible to make it easier,” he said. The Houthis, he claimed, “do not pose an immediate threat to Cyprus”.</p> <p>The US and UK strikes have exacerbated concerns of the Israel-Gaza war becoming a wider regional conflagration. Washington and London have vowed to continue the airstrikes if necessary.</p> <p>Cypriot activists say they are deeply concerned the British bases may also be used by the US and UK to send military aid to Israel, a claim neither country has confirmed.</p> <p>At Sunday’s protest, demonstrators chanted “out with the bases of death” outside the entrance of RAF Akrotiri, close to the coastal city of Limassol in the island’s south.</p> <p>“Put simply, we don’t want our country to be used in a war that has left more than 24,000 dead, the vast majority women and children,” said Costeas who presides over the Cyprus Peace Council, a bi-communal NGO that helped organise the rally. “We know what conflict means. Fifty years ago Cyprus was split by war.”</p> <p>Since the start of the Gaza war following the 7 October incursion by Hamas militants that left about 1,200 people dead, witnesses have spoken of a sharp increase in the number of military transport planes making the 40-minute journey from Akrotiri to Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Within weeks of the Hamas attack, Israel’s Haaretz newspaper <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-10-24/ty-article/u-s-deploys-more-arms-and-troops-to-israel-cyprus-and-jordan/0000018b-5cbf-d307-adbb-7dbf1aa80000\">reported</a> that “more than 40 US transport aircraft, 20 British transport aircraft and seven heavy transport helicopters [had] arrived at the British Akrotiri base on the island. They carried equipment, arms and forces.”</p> <p>The UK’s defence ministry has denied it is using the facilities – which also serve a surveillance-gathering role as a station for signals intelligence – to help Israel with “lethal cargo”. Instead, a defence ministry spokesperson sought at the weekend to highlight the EU member state’s humanitarian role in the region.</p> <p>“British Forces Cyprus continue to support the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza,” the official said. </p> <p>Activists in Cyprus, however, believe US aircraft have sent weaponry to Israel via Cyprus from depots at its bases around Europe.</p> <p>Asked about the claims, a US department of defense spokesperson said: “It is our policy to not discuss specific details of military logistics, to include aircraft movements for security reasons. All US military activities are fully compliant with international law and are coordinated closely with our allies.”</p> <p> Costeas, the peace activist, claimed there was evidence that spy planes were also operating out of Akrotiri. London and Washington have denied direct involvement in Israel’s war but said they have launched drones from Cyprus to Gaza to help search for hostages.</p> <p>President Christodoulides has been vocal in his desire to use the island’s proximity to Gaza to establish a maritime aid corridor between the port of Larnaca and the besieged coastal strip – a plan that, as yet, has not come to fruition, although a Royal Navy landing ship delivered 90 tons of air-freighted supplies bound for the Palestinian territory, via Egypt, last month.</p> <p>Both Greek and Turkish Cypriot peace activists have joined forces to denounce the role of the bases, with the main leftist AKEL party urging the government to do more to ensure the island “has no complicity in the bloodshed of Gaza”.</p> <p>“The government of Cyprus should have done more to stop the bases being used in this way,” said Vera Polycarpou, who heads AKEL’s international relations. “There have been protests against the bases’ presence here since 1964. It really is a joke, a sick joke, to hear that aid, and not weapons, are being carried by planes out of Akrotiri when all the evidence is to the contrary.”</p> <p>• The map on this article was amended on 21 January 2024 to refer to the northern part of the island as “Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>European lawmakers have lamented the UK’s decision to weaken environmental rules since leaving the EU, after the Guardian revealed it is falling behind in almost every policy area.</p> <p>One Green group MEP said the findings were “tragic” while a centre-right MEP said the divergences were “particularly bad” for companies that want to do business on both sides of the Channel.</p> <p>Grace O’Sullivan, an Irish MEP with the Green group, said the backsliding was not surprising given the number of promises the UK government had broken since former environment secretary Michael Gove committed to a “green” Brexit. “While we are no angels in the EU for environmental protection, we have made significant steps in the last few years updating and improving our legislation.”</p> <p>The Guardian analysis found that since Brexit, the UK has weakened its environment rules in key policy areas, from chemicals to climate. Among other measures, the EU has done more than the UK to ban harmful pesticides and substances, tax carbon emissions on imported goods, regulate batteries, and clean the air.</p> <p>The two economies are expected to grow further apart in environmental ambition as the EU brings in new rules on industrial emissions, outdoor air quality, critical raw materials, water treatment, and electrical waste recycling.</p> <p>O’Sullivan highlighted the UK’s worsening water quality standards as a “particularly troubling” example of divergence. “In Ireland, where previous governments have failed to prioritise the environment, EU legislation like this was instrumental in obliging the government to act to protect its own people from poor water treatment practices.”</p> <p>She added: “Both British and Irish people will bear the brunt of the UK government’s poor environmental record, as the recent collapse in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/23/lough-neagh-dying-in-plain-sight-say-campaigners-due-to-vast-algal-blooms\">water quality in Northern Ireland’s Lough Neagh</a> demonstrated.”</p> <p>Another divergence in policy is an EU effort to help those less able to pay the costs of the energy transition. The EU has legislated for a social climate fund to finance concrete measures that alleviate energy and transport poverty, as the remaining 27 member states move toward net zero emissions by 2050. So far, no comparable fund exists in the UK.</p> <p>Peter Liese, a German MEP and environment spokesperson for the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) group, said: “A big problem, in my view, is that the UK has not [got] something like a social climate fund. While we need to be ambitious in climate policy, we need to help those that are not able to pay for the transition themselves in a targeted way.”</p> <p>He added: “I very much regret the divergence in environmental rules between the EU and UK.”</p> <p>The UK government has not tracked its divergence from EU environment policy, leaving businesses and green groups to guess at the breadth and depth of the shift. But the Guardian analysis of data from the Institute For European Environmental Policy found the country was falling behind in almost every aspect of environmental regulation.</p> <p>Petros Kokkalis, a Greek MEP with the Left group, cited the EU tightening air quality rules as the UK weakened them as evidence that its “departure from our bloc is having a profound impact on every aspect of everyday life”. He said: “It is rather worrying to see that the UK is not following the same path. And it is even more worrying to realise that it is the citizens and their health that will bear the consequences.”</p> <p>Mohammed Chaim, a Dutch MEP with the centre-left Socialists and Democrats group, said recent EU legislation “clearly shows more ambition” than the UK, but cautioned that regulation was only one driver of the energy transition. He said: “Industry knows that the only way to preserve competitiveness within the continent, including the UK, is going green.”</p> <p>Still, he added, among European countries the UK had always been at the forefront in decarbonising its industry. “The UK used to be a leader when it came to climate.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The single engine plane landed briefly at British Columbia’s Cranbrook airport in June 2017. Its Canadian pilot, Alex Simons, and his girlfriend, Sydney Robillard, had stopped to refuel the Piper Warrior, a rented plane popular for training, before continuing westward. After struggling to get payment approved for the fuel, the couple were warned flying conditions over a nearby mountain range were rapidly deteriorating as a storm set in.</p> <p>But Simons, with less than 100 hours of flight experience, departed for the city of Kamloops. The aircraft never arrived. For two weeks rescue teams searched the rugged landscape of south-eastern British Columbia. But their search found nothing.</p> <p>“They just disappeared off the face of the Earth,” says Fred Carey, the head of British Columbia’s volunteer aerial search teams. More than six years later, there is still no trace of the plane or the couple – and search teams haven’t been able to give closure to a “deeply broken” family.</p> <p>For decades, the Canadian province’s Civil Air Search and Rescue Association boasted a near-perfect record of finding missing planes and people. And with wide access to powerful technologies, finding wrecks should be easier with each passing year. But the aerial search teams in British Columbia that scour one of the world’s most unforgiving landscapes have found the opposite: a string of unexplained disappearances have left them emotionally shattered and searching for answers.</p> <p>Aerial search and rescue has long captured the public imagination: determined volunteers criss-crossing the sky, racing to locate missing aircraft or stranded hikers. This week, those skills were on display after search teams braved challenging conditions to successfully locate a private helicopter that had crashed in the province.</p> <p>But the reality is far more demanding – and thankless – than people often realise, says Carey. “We don’t need a cheering audience and we often don’t have one. We just do it because we love to fly. It’s not easy to do. It takes the right person at the right angle at the right lighting and the right time to spot something. All of that stuff has to fall into place.”</p> <p>In one case, searchers located a plane that had vanished over a densely populated urban area months after initial search teams had given up.</p> <p>But in the last few years, three unsolved crashes – including the rented plane carrying Simons and Robillard in eastern British Columbia – represent an unnerving blemish on their record.</p>    <p>“When you go and you search the area for days using every tool you have and you don’t come up with anything, that’s hard on us,” says Carey. “We’ve had pilots and spotters experiencing depression. This is new and in many ways uncomfortable for us.”</p> <p>Searching for a downed plane doesn’t begin with spotters going out hunting for glints of metal, broken trees or tendrils of smoke on the landscape. First, teams study flight paths, plane types, levels of experience, weather systems and known hazards.</p> <p>Today their job is made easier by technology: even in small planes, pilots have mobile phones and tablets that use powerful software to track and predict their routes. “Getting lost is not really an option any more, unless you lose all your equipment,” says Carey.</p> <p>For the public, the ability to pinpoint the location of friends and family using those same devices is seemingly at odds with a plane completely vanishing.</p> <p>“How can a plane just go missing? It’s mad surely with the technology these days they could at least pinpoint the location of a plane,” one user wrote in an aviation forum the year before Simons’s plane disappeared. “We have the technology to transmit pictures of Pluto back to Earth … but a plane goes missing and can’t be found?!”</p> <p>In the event that a plane goes missing, British Columbia’s mountainous geography presents a challenge: more than half the province doesn’t have cellular reception, which is needed to locate a mobile phone. Without a signal, search teams must recreate a likely route. But Carey suspects this is where the odds are increasingly tilted against the search teams.</p> <p>“One of the big reasons we can’t find these planes – we think – is that we can’t get inside of the head of the pilot anymore.”</p> <p>Increasingly, Carey and flight instructors see younger pilots pointing to their GPS systems.</p> <p>“They say: ‘I can see everything. And if I ever get into trouble in bad weather, I’m going down to the highway.’ And that’s the worst thing you can do,” he says. “If you’re in trouble, you climb high and you call for support.” Novices are often untrained for emergency landings in poor weather and this raises the possibility of encountering more difficult flying conditions that can lead to a crash.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/brock-peters-hero-teen-pilot-route-66\">News coverage</a> of pilots <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/9958783/salmo-bc-plane-emergency-landing-highway/\">landing small planes on highways</a>, often hailed as quick-thinking heroes, hasn’t helped dissuade novices.</p> <p>Carey points to another young couple who hit bad weather and disappeared in the province. Teams initially assumed the pilot would have climbed to escape the storm system and so they “tore apart” the nearby mountains but found nothing.</p> <p>It wasn’t until a year later that a helicopter spotted a flash of metal 100 yards off the highway. “The pilot had stalled it,” says Carey. “He got down to the highway, had nowhere to go, tried to turn around, crashed it tail first. They didn’t survive. But we weren’t looking along the highway because airplanes never go down there. </p> <p>“We have to start rethinking how we do this. We need to start looking where we might never have searched in the past. We need to think pilots might do something that pilots would never do.”</p>",

Most are just normal cruise types, but some began documenting it on TikTok – basically just explaining what they do in a day, and showing their viewers the rooms, the meals, the other passengers – and despite that sounding like the worst reality television premise you’ve ever heard, it started going mega viral.</p> <p>Two months in and we now have a boat full of influencers who are trapped together on the high seas: a place where people famously love to go mad and get obsessed with hunting huge sexy whales.

A lot of the facilities are giving university dorm common room. In fact, after the cruise started to blow up, TikTok influencer Marc Sebastian begged to be sent on board, and was finally sponsored by a publishing company to go on for 18 nights. His review? “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@marcsebastianf/video/7324359913470315818\">I hate it here.</a>”</p> <p>He captioned a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@marcsebastianf/video/7321934787235564842\">video</a> touring his room by writing: “For 18 nights? fine.

sparked a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza’s 2.4 million people, who are struggling to get food, water, fuel and medical care.</p> \n  <p>Opening the Ashdod port would reduce the time it took to

will to push back the aggression is infinite.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>His remarks came after Israeli airstrikes “completely destroyed” at least three houses in southern Lebanon on Friday, the official Lebanese news agency NNA and the mayor of the affected border community said.</p> \n  <p>The Israeli army said on Friday it had “conducted air strikes and carried out artillery and tank fire against Hezbollah observation posts and terrorist infrastructure” in the Kfar Kila sector.</p> \n  <p>On Friday afternoon, Hezbollah claimed three attacks, including two against “deployments of soldiers of the Israeli enemy” on the border, including using Burkan missiles, which can carry a large explosive payload.</p> \n  <p>Since 7 October, Israel has repeatedly bombarded Lebanese border villages, with the violence killing more than 195 people in Lebanon, including at least 142 Hezbollah fighters, according to an AFP tally.</p> \n  <p>On the Israeli side, 15 people have been killed, of whom nine were soldiers and six civilians, according to the Israeli army.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-20T02:24:42.218Z\">at 2.24am

Here’s a recap of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>EU</strong> foreign ministers will hold a series of meetings on Monday with counterparts from <strong>Israel</strong>, the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong> and key Arab nations about the war in <strong>Gaza</strong> and prospects for a future peace settlement. The Israeli foreign minister <strong>Israel Katz</strong> and his Palestinian counterpart <strong>Riyad al-Maliki</strong> are not expected to meet each other.</p></li> \n   <li><p>There can be “no security and stability in the region” without a Palestinian state, said the spokesperson for the Palestinian president <strong>Mahmoud Abbas</strong>. The remarks come in response to Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>’s rejection on Thursday of calls by the <strong>US</strong> to take steps toward the establishment of a Palestinian state after the war.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Only a ceasefire deal can win the release of dozens of hostages held by <strong>Hamas</strong> in <strong>Gaza</strong> and that those claiming they can be freed through military pressure are spreading illusions, said former army chief and member of Israel’s war cabinet, <strong>Gadi Eisenkot</strong>. In a thinly veiled criticism of Netanyahu, Eisenkot also said strategic decisions about the direction of the war must be made urgently.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Unicef</strong> described the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> as “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child” in a statement released after a visit to the area by its deputy executive director <strong>Ted Chaiban</strong>. Of the nearly 25,000 people reported to have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the escalation in hostilities, up to 70% are reported to be women and children, he said, calling the conditions faced some of the “most horrific” he had ever seen.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Detainees in Gaza described being “beaten, humiliated, subjected to ill-treatment, and to what may amount to torture” said the spokesperson for the <strong>UN</strong> high commissioner for human rights, <strong>Ravina Shamdasani</strong>. She said there had also been reports of men who were subsequently released in “only diapers”. Reporting from <strong>Rafah</strong>, the UN envoy described the situation in Gaza as a “massive human rights crisis” and a “major, human-made, humanitarian disaster”.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The WHO said overnight it had counted 24 cases of hepatitis A and “thousands” of cases of jaundice likely linked to the spread of the viral liver infection in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a>. The WHO chief, <strong>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</strong> described the health crisis in the Palestinian territory as “explosive”</p></li> \n   <li><p>Israeli shelling has killed two people in the <strong>Abasan</strong> area of <strong>Khan Younis</strong>, bringing the number killed in the city to 10 since last night. Al Jazeera reported that Israeli forces were continuing to shell Khan Younis while bringing in reinforcements to the area. The death toll from Thursday night’s strike on a home in western Khan Younis rose to eight, while 15 people were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit an apartment block near the <strong>Gaza City health facility</strong>. Another strike in the northern city’s <strong>Sabra</strong> neighbourhood had also injured several civilians, Al Jazeera said, citing the <strong>Palestinian</strong> news agency Wafa.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israeli</strong> gunboats are hitting coastal areas of <strong>Gaza City</strong>, which has also been the site of heavy airstrikes. At least 12 people have been killed and several have been injured from a strike that hit a residence near the city’s <strong>al-Shifa</strong> hospital. Reporting from <strong>Tulkarm refugee camp</strong> in the <strong>West Bank</strong>, Al Jazeera’s reporter Hoda Abdel-Hamid said the “mood is one of anger” and that “the raid lasted nearly 40 hours, one of the longest we have seen in the occupied West Bank since 7 October”.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Israeli forces have advanced further into southern Gaza’s main city, pounding areas near the Nasser hospital (the territory’s biggest hospital still partially working) sparking fears it could be forced to close due to Israeli bombardments and evacuation orders.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A <strong>Hamas</strong> delegation has visited <strong>Moscow</strong>, says the <strong>Russian</strong> foreign ministry. During the talks, the Russian side emphasised the need for Hamas to release Israeli hostages and condemned the “catastrophic” humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Essential aid including food and medical supplies are being prevented from entering Gaza, says the charity ActionAid UK, criticising “confusing and arbitrary rules about the type of aid permitted to enter Gaza”. The charity says it had resulted in thousands of essential items being stopped at border crossings as well as increasing the time spent on screening trucks, leading to a backlog at the border.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The <strong>IDF</strong> appeared to confirm reports that its soldiers had dug up graves in a Gaza cemetery, explaining that it took the action in order to verify that the bodies of hostages were not buried there, reports the Times of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>. Responding to a query from US outlet NBC, the IDF said in a statement that it is “committed to fulfilling its urgent mission to rescue the hostages and find and return the bodies of hostages that are held in Gaza”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Pakistan</strong>’s prime minister held an emergency security meeting on Friday with military and intelligence chiefs after trading deadly airstrikes with <strong>Iran</strong> on militant targets this week.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Thousands of <strong>Houthi</strong> supporters took to the streets in <strong>Sana’a</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong> on Friday to express their solidarity with <strong>Palestinians</strong>, protest against <strong>US</strong> air raids and to denounce the US labeling of Houthis as a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ group.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Demonstrators in <strong>Amman</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong> carried flags and signs reading: ‘100 days of resilience, sacrifice, heroism and pride’ during a protest in support of Palestinians in Gaza on Friday.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A senior Houthi official promised safe passage for Russian and <strong>Chinese</strong> vessels through the <strong>Red Sea</strong>, where the Iran-backed Yemeni militant group has been carrying out attacks on commercial ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Israel’s emergency government is “close to collapse” as Gaza war continues, with “the question no longer being whether an election will take place in 2024”, but rather when in 2024, reports The Jerusalem Post.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Belgium</strong> will supply a vessel to an EU mission to protect shipping from attacks by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia in the <strong>Red Sea</strong>, the Belgian broadcaster VRT reports, citing government sources. <strong>The Netherlands</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> have also said they are willing to contribute ships to mission.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Some cruise operators have cancelled or adjusted their itineraries to avoid the Red Sea due to attacks on ships by <strong>Houthi</strong> militia. Royal Caribbean said it had cancelled two voyages so far: one from <strong>Muscat</strong> to <strong>Dubai</strong> and another from Dubai to <strong>Mumbai</strong>. The Swiss-Italian operator MSC Cruises said on Wednesday it had cancelled three trips in April from <strong>South Africa</strong> and the <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> to <strong>Europe</strong> due to the Red Sea crisis.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-19T15:22:37.195Z\">at 3.22pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-65aa85508f08fb29729ff45f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-19T14:27:21.447Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>My colleague, the Guardian’s Brussels correspondent Lisa O’Carroll, has more on the news about next week’s meeting of EU ministers, leaders from across the Middle East and a representative from Israel:</em></p> \n  <p>Leaders from across the <strong>Middle East</strong> and a representative from <strong>Israel</strong> will meet <strong>EU</strong> foreign ministers on Monday.</p> \n  <p>It is understood EU ministers will convey their strong opposition to the Israeli representative to <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> after yesterday’s declaration that he rejects any moves to establish a <strong>Palestinian</strong> state when Israel ends its war on <strong>Gaza</strong>.</p> \n  <p>But their main mission is to progress the so-called “day after” plan to rebuild Gaza physically and politically when the war is over.</p> \n  <p>Attending the meetings will be the Palestinian foreign minister and the prime ministers of <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> and the secretary general of the <strong>Arab League</strong> as well as the EU’s chief diplomat, <strong>Josep Borrell</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Financial sanctions against <strong>Hamas</strong> are also expected to be agreed at the meeting of EU foreign ministers along with the final touches to a new deal with <strong>Eygpt</strong> on investment, water supplies and migration.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-19T15:50:47.024Z\">at 3.50pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-65aa80fe8f082472faf42f0b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-19T14:18:17.107Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">EU ministers to meet Israeli and Palestinian top diplomats on Monday</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>EU</strong> foreign ministers will hold a series of meetings on Monday with counterparts from <strong>Israel</strong>, the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong> and key Arab nations about the war in <strong>Gaza</strong> and prospects for a future peace settlement, reports AFP citing official sources.</p> \n  <p>The Israeli foreign minister, <strong>Israel Katz,</strong> and his Palestinian counterpart, <strong>Riyad al-Maliki,</strong> are not expected to meet each other.</p> \n  <p>The foreign ministers of <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong> and <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> will also meet European ministers in Brussels.

In the statement, published on Unicef’s website, Chaiban said he met “children and their families suffering some of the most horrific conditions I have ever seen”.</p> \n  <p>He said: “Since my last visit, the situation has gone from catastrophic to near collapse. Unicef has described the Gaza Strip as the most dangerous place in the world to be a child. We have said this is a war on children. But these truths do not seem to be getting through.”</p> \n  <p>Of the nearly 25,000 people reported to have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the escalation in hostilities, up to 70% are reported to be women and children, he said. “The killing of children must cease immediately.”</p> \n  <p>In the statement, Chaiban recalled meeting wounded children, such as 13-year-old Ibrahim who had undergone an arm amputation without anaesthetic after developing gangrene because of a lack of medicine for his infected and damaged hand. He was in “a designated shelter with his family, in an area they were told was safe, when everything collapsed around them”. </p> \n  <p>Chaiban continued: “The sheer mass of civilians on the border is hard to fathom and the conditions they live in are inhumane. Water is scarce and poor sanitation is inescapable. The cold and rain this week created rivers of waste. The little food that is available doesn’t meet children’s unique nutritional needs. As a result, thousands of children are malnourished and sick.</p> \n  <p>Cases of diarrhoea were up 40% from two months ago, before the escalation in hostilities, said Chaiban, adding that by mid-December, 71,000 cases were recorded among children under five, a more than 4000% increase since the war began.</p> \n  <p>“This is nothing short of a staggering decline in conditions for the children of Gaza. If this decline persists, we could see deaths due to indiscriminate conflict compounded by deaths due to disease and hunger. We need a major breakthrough,” he said. Chaiban has called to an end to the “intense bombardment”, which is not only killing thousands of people, but also impeding the delivery of aid he said.</p> \n  <p>“Before the conflict more than 500 trucks entered the Gaza Strip every day. When I was there in November, about 60 aid trucks a day entered. Now, it is about 130 trucks a day alongside an average of 30 commercial trucks a day. This is with the opening of a second crossing point but it still remains wholly inadequate. We are trying to drip assistance through a straw to meet an ocean of need,” said Chaiban.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1748099238406320258\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“UNICEF has described the Gaza Strip as the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.

In the first two weeks of January, only seven of 29 planned aid deliveries have successfully reached their destinations in northern Gaza. Not a single Unicef convoy has accessed the north of the Gaza Strip in 2024.”</p> \n  <p>He concluded: “We cannot wait any longer for a humanitarian ceasefire to end the daily killing and injuring of children and their families, enable the urgent delivery of desperately needed aid and the safe and unconditional release of the two remaining Israeli children still held hostage in Gaza.

In other developments as it turns 8.40am in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and 7.40am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The US has carried out a fifth strike against Houthi targets in Yemen, even as Joe Biden acknowledged that bombing the militants has yet to stop their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. </strong>Late on Thursday US warplanes targeted anti-ship missiles that “were aimed into the southern Red Sea and prepared to launch”, according to US Central Command. The US president told reporters: “When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue? Yes.”</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ae112784-3e3a-4969-88e2-4e0115d55da2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uw68l-bSpwo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Also on Thursday night, Houthis fired missiles at a US-owned tanker ship in the Gulf of Aden</strong>. The White House and the Houthis gave differing accounts of the launches at the Chem Ranger, with the militants saying their naval forces had attacked “with several appropriate naval missiles, resulting in direct hits”. However, US Central Command said the Houthis launched two anti-ship ballistic missiles and that they hit the water near the ship, causing no damage or injuries. It said it was the third Houthi strike on a commercial shipping vessel in three days.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>A total of 24,620 Palestinians have been killed and 61,830 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since 7 October</strong>, according to the latest figures by the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry on Thursday. The figures include 172 killed and 326 injured in the past 24 hours.

Eight people were killed on Thursday, the Israeli military said.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"11da0217-32a3-4db4-9a60-eb7c5bee0280\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1z0ZWbAOa_o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the White House that he rejects any moves to establish a Palestinian state when Israel ends its offensive against Gaza,</strong> and that all territory west of the Jordan River would be under Israeli security control. His public statement on Thursday represented his sharpest rebuttal of US foreign policy. The White House responded by saying the US would continue working towards a two-state solution and that there could be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza when the war concluded.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Pakistan has launched retaliatory strikes against militants in Iran in response to attacks by Tehran that targeted sites within Pakistan’s borders,</strong> heightening fears of further instability across the Middle East and surrounding region. Ten people from one family were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/pakistan-launches-retaliatory-strikes-in-iran-aimed-at-separatist-militant-group\">killed in the attacks</a>, including six children, reportedly all “non Iranian nationals”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Children in Gaza are suffering from “horrific conditions” and the Palestinian territory remains the most dangerous place in the world to be a child, the deputy chief of the UN children’s agency says</strong>. Ted Chaiban said at the end of a three-day visit to Gaza that since his last visit two months ago “the situation has gone from catastrophe to near collapse”. If the staggering decline in conditions persisted, “we could see deaths due to indiscriminate conflict compounded by deaths due to disease and hunger”, he said.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>A communications blackout in Gaza entered a </strong><strong>seventh day</strong> on Thursday, hindering rescue and relief efforts.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>There was no word on Thursday on whether medicines that entered Gaza as part of a deal brokered by France and Qatar had been distributed to dozens of hostages</strong> with chronic illnesses who are being held by Hamas. Qatar confirmed late on Wednesday that the medicine had entered Gaza, but it was not yet clear if it had been distributed to the hostages, who are being held in secret locations.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The EU is set to adopt sanctions against Hamas on Monday that will “target individuals and ban money transfers”</strong>, according to the French foreign ministry. EU foreign ministers were also expected to discuss possible measures against violent Israeli settlers, a ministry spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the European parliament has voted to call for a “permanent ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip, but on condition that all Israeli hostages held in the territory are released and Hamas dismantled. The resolution on Thursday, which is non-binding, stopped short of calling for an unconditional ceasefire in Gaza.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Mexico and Chile have asked the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate possible crimes against civilians in Gaza. </strong>In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry said the action “is due to growing worry over the latest escalation of violence, particularly against civilian targets”. Any proceedings by the ICC would be separate from South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide at the UN’s international court of justice.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>An airstrike on southern Syria early on Thursday killed at least nine people and was probably carried out by Jordan’s air force, Syrian opposition activists said</strong>, over the latest in a series of strikes in an area where cross-border drug smugglers have been active. There was no immediate confirmation from Jordan on the strike that hit the province of Sweida, and there was some confusion over the number of people killed.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Israel has joined a notorious band of authoritarian states with a history of imprisoning journalists by detaining Palestinian reporters without trial since the beginning of the latest war in Gaza. </strong>A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists released on Thursday said that for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/18/journalists-jailed-imprisoned-israel\">Israel figures in its list of “worst jailers of journalists”</a>, putting it on a par with Iran.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-19T13:32:15.436Z\">at 1.32pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

            "body" : "<p>To reminisce is to stir up ghosts; there is something uncanny about the act of remembering. Playwright Matthew Whittet taps directly into the strangeness but also the joy of deep recollection with Seventeen, a play that encourages a kind of exhumation of former selves, on stage and in the audience. Its genius lies in its dual aspect, the way it is haunted by the future as much as the past.</p> <p>We open in a children’s playground, a setting that should be trite but that reveals hidden layers of meaning. School’s out forever as the cast of characters gather to celebrate their matriculation, drink too much, pash each other and fret about their prospects. It would be too quotidian but for the central conceit: these 17-year-olds are played by actors decades older, some in their 70s.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The most boisterous and belligerent of the group is Mike (Richard Piper), who is dating Jess (Pamela Rabe) but seems keen to get pissed with best mate Tom (Robert Menzies) rather than work on his relationship. Tom is Mike’s slightly morose, less confident foil – his biggest problem is a looming move to Adelaide with his parents. Emilia (Genevieve Picot) is Jess’s best friend: smart, impervious and secretly holding a candle for Tom. Ronny (George Shevtsov) is the outsider, ostensibly homeless but keen to forget that for a single night. Rounding out the group is Mike’s little sister Lizzy (Fiona Choi), bursting with enthusiasm.</p>    <p>Director Matt Edgerton gets a lot of initial mileage out of the raucous, teetering energy of adolescence; there’s an explosive sense of exhilaration about these kids, a wildness unloosening. If this were all, though, it wouldn’t be enough. Thankfully, Whittet and Edgerton have something more intricate and elegiac in mind. As their uncertain futures loom, and they begin to realise how precipitous their situations have become, the characters fall into deeper contemplation and the work tilts towards profundity.</p> <p>One of Whittet’s main concerns with Seventeen is the telescopic nature of time, the way it stretches or narrows depending on the view. For these kids, the gap of time between the ages of 11 and 17 is monstrous; for the audience, who are for the most part closer in age to the actors than the characters, it’s a tiny blip. We might carry our 17-year-old selves inside us throughout our lives – and the slightest bump can ricochet us back to our formative years as if the interim never happened – but the ravages of time are written on our faces. The dawn that comes for us is tinged with death, rather than potential.</p> <p>All of which makes the play sound ponderous and philosophical, where really it is mercurial and charming. The cast are uniformly excellent, their performances spirited and poignant. Rabe and Picot brilliantly convey young women reluctant to embrace their own power, but forceful and determined enough to know they want more. Choi is wonderful as the firecracker Lizzy, shooting her enthusiasm into the sky.</p> <p>The boys are beautifully shambolic, too. Mike is something of a bully at first, but Piper allows glints of doubt and regret to pierce the bluster. Menzies uses his natural hangdog expression to convey a grand bewilderment – with girls and choices and life in general. Shevtsov is quietly heartbreaking as the boy othered by circumstance, impossibly vulnerable and alone.</p>    <p>Christina Smith’s set and costumes are simple and bold, that playground revolving so slowly it’s almost imperceptible. This has a practical application – the static nature of the play equipment is given interest and variability – but also thematic implications: the days spin fast, but as we stand in them they can seem to hardly move at all. Paul Jackson’s lighting is strong, with an exquisite final image of the golden dawn breaking, pushing the play into allegory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/04/seventeen-going-on-70-the-play-that-connects-the-generations\">Seventeen going on 70: the play that connects the generations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whittet hasn’t really created contemporary kids here – these characters are too naive and inexperienced to evoke today’s highly connected, savvy youth – and Edgerton wisely avoids aping current idioms and attitudes. The goal isn’t to construct an anthropological view of modern youth culture. Rather, Seventeen aims to summon our own, obscured teenage selves, and to grapple with the mystifying allure and trap of memory itself.</p> <p>That playground, inhabited by teenagers far too old for its juvenile pleasures – and played in turn by actors far too old for their own milieu – comes to seem like the holding place for our youth. In his novel The Go-Between, LP Hartley wrote: “the past is a foreign country; they do things differently there”. Whittet might just disagree: the past may be another country, but its ways and contours are eerily familiar and they linger long after the blush has faded. Maybe we’ll always be 17 – on a cusp, frightened but elated, and fully alive.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.mtc.com.au/plays-and-tickets/whats-on/season-2024/seventeen/\">Seventeen is on at the Melbourne Theatre Company</a>, Sumner theatre, until 17 February.</em></p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine is accused by Russia of being behind a drone strike that sparked a huge inferno at an oil depot in western Russia on Friday, the latest in a series of escalating cross-border attacks. </strong>Russian officials and news reports said four oil reservoirs with a total capacity of 6,000 cubic metres (1.6m gallons) were set on fire at the oil refinery after the drone reached Klintsy, a city of 70,000 people located about 60km (40 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Air defences electronically jammed the drone but it dropped its explosive payload on the facility, Bryansk regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz said. There were no casualties, he added. The strike is the second on a Russian oil depot in as many days, part of what Kyiv has called “fair” retaliation for Moscow’s strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Separately, a fire tore through Ryazan oil refinery, Russia’s third-largest, on Friday, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said, quoting emergency services. The fire at the oil refinery, which lids south-east of Moscow and is controlled by Rosneft, has been put out and there were no injuries, RIA news agency reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US aid to Ukraine remains deadlocked in Congress</strong> despite Joe Biden signing on Friday a measure to keep the US government funded. Hard-right House Republicans, led by the speaker, Mike Johnson, are ensuring the chances of more money and weapons for Kyiv in its fight with Moscow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/19/biden-signs-government-funding-ukraine-aid-frozen\">hinge on negotiations for US immigration changes</a>. After a Wednesday White House meeting, Johnson told reporters: “We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine. But the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security.” Many observers suggest Republicans do not want a deal, instead using the issue, and the concept of more aid for Ukraine, as clubs with which to attack Biden in an election year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Russian court in Siberia on Friday sentenced a man to 19 years in prison for shooting a military enlistment officer</strong> while prosecutors in St Petersburg asked for a 28-year sentence for Darya Trepova, a woman charged in the bombing of a cafe last April that killed a prominent military blogger, reports said. The developments underscore the authorities’ determination to harshly punish anyone who acts against President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, especially those committing acts of violence, in the run-up to the presidential election in March that the Russian president is all but certain to win.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The European Union said on Friday it would drastically increase ammunition production this year</strong> in response to Ukraine’s growing pleas for support in its war against Russia, which summoned the French ambassador to protest against the country’s “growing involvement” in the conflict. The EU will be able to churn out at least 1.3m rounds of ammunition by the end of this year, EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said on a visit to Estonia. “We are at a crucial moment for our collective security in Europe, and in the war of aggression run by Russia in Ukraine, Europe must and will continue to support Ukraine with all its means,” he told.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Landmines once again surround the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine,</strong> which is in Russian hands, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. Europe’s largest nuclear facility fell to Russian forces shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of planning an incident at the site. “Mines along the perimeter of the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant) ... are now back in place,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nato will launch its biggest military exercises in decades next week, with about 90,000 personnel set to take part in months of drills </strong>aimed at showing the alliance can defend all of its territory up to its border with Russia, top officers said Thursday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Finland does not see any immediate military threat from Russia, the country’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said</strong> on Friday at a press conference with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Britain brushed off a Russian plan to ban UK ships from fishing in Moscow’s waters on Friday as an example of Russia’s “self-imposed isolation”</strong>, while an industry body said it would have no impact because Britain’s fleet doesn’t fish there anyway.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU has started discussions on a new sanctions package for Russia</strong> that it aims to approve by 24 February, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>About 160 people who applied for asylum at Finland’s eastern border last year have since disappeared</strong>, amid a sudden surge of asylum seekers arriving via Russia, Finland’s immigration authority said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin said on Friday there was no prospect of reviving the Black Sea grain</strong> <strong>deal</strong> and that alternative routes for shipping Ukrainian grain carried huge risks, Reuters reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Police in the central Russian republic of Bashkortostan on Friday arrested more protesters incensed over the jailing of local activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/17/hundreds-of-protesters-clash-with-police-in-russian-republic-of-bashkortostan\">Fail Alsynov</a>,</strong> who campaigns for the protection of the Bashkir language, as a court sentenced nine demonstrators to short jail terms, reports AFP.</p></li> </ul>",

In the 18 months since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/dec/15/neil-gorsuch-us-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion\">Roe’s demise</a>, abortion rights supporters have trounced anti-abortion activists in state-level ballot referendums. Yet the march’s message was largely similar to past years: speakers and attendees alike talked about the need to make abortion “unthinkable” rather than just illegal – with scant details on how to make that happen.</p> <p>“We don’t want to just go in and be the bad guys,” said Elijah Persinger, a 19-year-old from Fort Wayne, Indiana. “We want to make make people understand and help them understand the science behind things and the logic that we’re going by as well.”</p> <p>As in years past, march attendees skewed young. Schools and universities organize trips for students to attend the march, and groups often carry banners and flags with their schools’ names. Some groups all wear bright-colored, matching hats in order to keep from getting lost in the crowd.</p> <p>Persinger took a 12-hour, overnight bus ride to attend Friday’s March for Life. His group planned to leave DC after the event.</p> <p>But the crowd on Friday seemed relatively sparse. When the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, stood on a podium to speak, he was met with only muted applause – despite being a high-profile attendee for the march. The greatest response came when he mentioned Biden: when he said that the president’s administration planned to restrict funding to crisis pregnancy centers, the crowd booed loudly.</p> <p>Organizers also spoke from the stage about the need to support maternity homes and crisis pregnancy centers, facilities that aim to convince people to keep their pregnancies.</p> <p>“Christians don’t mean to impose what we believe on anyone. But this nation was founded as a Christian nation,” said Laurel Brooks, a march attendee from North Carolina.</p> <p>Brooks works for an organization called My Faith Votes, which aims to mobilize Christian voters, but she clarified that she was sharing her own views, not her organization’s.</p> <p>“The foundation of America is truly Christian,” Brooks remarked. “That doesn’t mean we reject, hate, dislike anyone who does not believe as we do. That’s not who Christians are. We accept people for their free will. God honors free will.”</p>    <p>After the speakers finished, marchers spent three hours slowly walking from the National Mall to the steps of the US supreme court. The weather was unusually wintry, with marchers braving wind and several inches of snow.</p> <p>To keep from getting cold, some marchers danced to the Cha Cha Slide. Others started a call-and-response chant of, “We are pro-life, marching for life, saving the babies, one at a time!”</p> <p>Icons of fetuses and babies dominated the march. Many carried signs with ultrasound images above phrases such as “Future Doctor”, “Future Dancer”, and “Future Wife”. Others had signs with images of babies above the conservative slogan “Don’t Tread on Me”.</p> <p>“There are no mistakes, just happy accidents,” read another sign, complete with a hand-drawn beaming baby and portrait of the painter Bob Ross. One young woman even carried a baby made out of snow.</p> <p>At least one man was trying to sell Trump 2024 merchandise to marchers. But overall, Donald Trump had a minimal presence at the march despite being the frontrunner for the Republican White House nomination as he seeks a second presidency.</p> <p>Trump has waffled on his stance on abortion: while he has taken credit for installing supreme court justices who helped overturn Roe, he has also suggested that hardline stances on abortion can backfire on Republicans.</p> <p>“I’m not voting for Trump, I know that much,” said Ali Mumbach, 26. She carried a sign listing police brutality, gun violence and other issues that should matter to anti-abortion activists who call themselves “pro-life”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/13/abortion-republican-voters-presidential-election\">Many Republicans support abortion. Are they switching parties because of it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Trump is anti-life, especially in regards to Black lives and the lives of immigrants. So, yeah, I don’t think that he is pro-life. I don’t think that he cares about people who live in poverty. I don’t think he has the best interests of the American people,” Mumbach said.</p> <p>Democrats, meanwhile, are hoping sustained outrage over Roe will propel them to victory up and down the general election ballot.</p> <p>The Biden campaign is now launching a paid media campaign, timed to Roe’s anniversary, to target women and swing voters in battleground states.</p> <p>Harris plans<strong> </strong>to appear on Monday in Wisconsin to spotlight post-Roe attacks on reproductive rights before holding a campaign rally alongside Biden in Virginia.</p> <p>In the November 2023 state elections, Virginia Republicans tried to take control of the state legislature by promising to enact a “reasonable” ban on terminating pregnancies that were 15 weeks or beyond – an effort that failed.</p>",

Their lawyers told the court that the use of force was legitimate, necessary and proportionate. Castelain’s lawyer said that accusations of racism against his client were unfounded.</p> <p>Luhaka, now 29, was a young sports mentor at the time of the attack and was due to start a career as a professional footballer in Belgium. After the attack he gave up football, moved neighbourhood and now lives with his mother, rarely going out.</p> <p>Before the trial, <a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/theo-luhaka-je-ne-veux-pas-faire-le-proces-de-la-police-08-01-2024-XMJ4RXSUANFN5OHD5G5I3TLS2U.php\">he told Le Parisien</a>: “I died that day.”<strong> </strong>He told reporters before the verdict that the length of the sentence did not matter to him as long as the officers were found guilty and that the truth was told.</p> <p>The prosecutor Loïc Pageot had sought a three-year suspended prison sentence for Castelain and judged Luhaka’s injury to be a permanent disability. He sought shorter suspended prison sentences for the other two officers.</p> <p>“We need a police that protects us, not police officers like these who employ gratuitous violence,” he told the court on Thursday, describing the violence as unnecessary and “vengeful” as Luhaka did not pose an immediate threat.</p> <p>After the trial, Luhaka’s lawyer, Antoine Vey, said the verdict was a “victory” that confirms that “Theo was a victim and did nothing to justify being arrested”. </p> <p>However, angry protesters at the courthouse shouted for police to serve prison sentences. “It is a masquerade to have a suspended for mutilating Theo for life,” Samia El Khalfaoui, one of the protesters, whose brother Souheil was killed by a police officer in 2021, said.</p> <p>Most cases against police officers for voluntary violence are dismissed before reaching trial in France, and in 2021 less than 15% of guilty judgments resulted in actual jail time served, official data shows. </p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>",

He described it as a moment of “complete foolishness” rather than anything to do with his mental health.</p> <p>“This isn’t about cost of living … it’s not about gaining resources. They’re not stealing because they’re struggling [financially],” Mallett says, while making clear she’s not talking about any specific case.</p> <p>Speaking generally about high-profile, well-resourced people who steal, Mallett says they likely would never use the item, but hide it, give it away, or even return it.</p> <p>“If people are suffering from an acute mental health condition that compels them to steal – such as kleptomania – they feel very anxious and distressed and stealing is their outlet,” she says.</p> <p>“They get an emotional release when they steal something and that’s their way of managing their distress.</p> <p>“They often feel extremely guilty and remorseful afterwards.”</p> <p>The psychiatry bible, the DSM-V, classifies kleptomania as an <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/conditions/kleptomania\">impulse control disorder</a>, with similarities to obsessive-compulsive and addictive disorders. It is diagnosed three times more often in women, although the rate of diagnosis is not necessarily indicative of the rate of its occurrence and, Mallett says, the common trope of a middle-age woman as a shoplifter is a stereotype.</p> <p>Mallett says kleptomania often coexists with depression and anxiety, whereby stealing is a compulsion rather than a choice.</p> <p>The Australian Retailers Association wants tougher penalties for shoplifting, and more police resources, while supermarkets have put in new surveillance technology and physical security.</p> <p>Mallett says it’s important to work out why someone is shoplifting. Gangs stealing and on-selling, and people stealing for selfish reasons are one thing, she says. And it’s not the same as someone stealing because of the cost-of-living crisis.</p> <p>But high-profile, middle-class or wealthy individuals? That’s a different discussion again.</p> <p>“[The compulsion to steal is] something that causes a lot of distress,” she says. “People who are high profile, when it does come out it increases the shame. It’s about an individual struggling with personal issues and needing an emotional outlet.”</p> <p>Mallett says people may need different kinds of help. “Someone who’s stealing because they can’t afford to feed their family, that’s a social problem. They need support,” she says. “Some people may need better mental health support.</p> <p>“We may need some sympathy, as opposed to ridicule.

            "body" : "<p>Harry Fisher has spent much of his life camping. As a child, his parents would take the family out to the bush, where his Zimbabwean dad would utilise his knowledge of Braai [a social custom similar to barbecuing that’s popular in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia] to start campfires for cooking.</p> <p>“Dad had such a familiarity with fire because Braai in Africa is strictly cooked with wood,” he says. “Mum [who was a chef] would lean into that by making dishes that relied on fire and charcoal cooking, so we ate really well – Indonesian and Japanese and stir-fries and steaks.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/18/filipino-philippines-cuisine-recipes-dishes-traditions\">‘No rules’ and ‘riotous flavour’: how to cook and eat like you’re on holiday in the Philippines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just one month after he got his driving licence, Fisher went camping in the bush with his two best mates and “the most basic of gear” – they had a ball.</p> <p>But not every trip was a hit. Once, camping with friends, “we thought we were going to be big strong men and spear our fish and cook it, fish and chip-style, deep-fried in oil,” he says. They speared a couple of beautiful-looking, white fleshed fish, but when they cut the fish open “they absolutely stank”.</p> <p>“They were slow and easy to spear because they tasted terrible – so bad that you [couldn’t] even use them as bait … Being 17 and being too proud to admit it, we forced it down, but the next night, we just had pasta and sausages.”</p> <p>The experience was a valuable lesson in realistic expectations. “I know that even after 25 years of fishing, I would probably starve to death if I relied on it.”</p> <h2>Ingredients for a campfire cook</h2> <p>Fisher now advises campers on utilising fire to prepare “tasty, simple and interesting” food through his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVbGxGVUyKNihPeh7Efa-Zg\">YouTube channel</a> and cookbook Fire to Fork. He has developed a “framework of rules” when it comes to camp cooking.</p>    <p>“Firstly, all ingredients have to be available from a supermarket or a butcher, so that no matter which little town you stop at you can get the right stuff,” he says.</p> <p>“Secondly, the meals need to create minimal mess to save time and water, so nothing that requires more than two cooking items (such as a pot and a pan). And thirdly everything is cooked on fire.”</p> <p>It’s all about simplifying the process so that you pack light and utilise readily-available ingredients like vacuum-sealed meat, which he says will keep you “sorted for a week” in a cooler.</p> <p>“Too many people rely on tinned food and hiking meals, but nothing needs to be all that rugged.</p> <p>“Most people are just going away for a weekend or a long weekend, so feel free to bring soft cheese and chicken and salmon and lettuce. You can definitely bring a dozen eggs and some fresh garlic and ginger to knock up a really nice fried rice or omelette.”</p> <p>Fisher’s staples include “salt, pepper, cooking oil, hot sauce, kewpie mayo, sugar, sesame seeds, soy sauce, sesame oil, mustard, stock and a cold drink” – basics that you will probably have around your kitchen, or that you can easily keep using when you get back home.</p>    <p>He also encourages embracing cuisines and recipes that use fire cooking already: “Teriyaki beef, great Argentinian-style steaks, garlic prawns, even smoked bagels”.</p> <p>“I think any grilled seafood is fantastic … and of course lamb cutlets just go so well with nearly anything,” he says. “Just try and stick to the basics and do them well.”</p> <h2>Building the fire</h2> <p>The biggest basic of them all? Building a campfire. Fisher says it’s a “huge thing to practise”: beginning with a coal base, ensuring it’s not too smoky, and working on heat control.</p>    <p>Fisher says “not worry too much about expensive gear and things like that”, but you will need a grill grate or portable Braai to place pots and pans on.</p> <p>He encourages campers to source a local firewood supplier, rather than relying on hardware stores and service stations, because specialists will probably have firewood that’s better for cooking.</p> <p>He suggests starting with boiled dishes like pastas, because “it doesn’t really matter if the water boils over a few times while you’re learning, and it tends to put the fire out a bit anyway which sort of self-regulates it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/11/maltese-food-recipes-broad-beans-octopus-salad-qarnit-bit-tewm-simon-bajada\">‘Broad beans are so loved’: how to cook and eat as though you’re on holiday in Malta</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once you’re a bit more comfortable, you can start using the fire as you would a barbecue. “It shouldn’t be intimidating once you have a grill on it and you can see the food cooking,” he says, just “take it off if it’s burning”.</p> <p>“It’s by far the most social and easiest way to learn to cook on a fire – plus who doesn’t like watching their food get cooked in real time? Dinner <em>and</em> a show.”</p> <h2>Harry Fisher’s ultimate fish wraps</h2> <p>After a lot of research (in other words, eating far too many wraps), I have finally landed on a recipe that is both simple and delicious, which is what these fish wraps are all about. I think fellow Western Australian YouTube personality and fish-wrap king, Brodie Moss, would be proud of these.</p> <p>I love threadfin salmon or mangrove jack for these wraps, but whatever fresh, white-fleshed fish you can get will work well.</p>    <p>Prep <strong>3 minutes<br></strong>Cook <strong>10 minutes<br></strong>Serves <strong>2</strong><br><br>Gear: <strong>Fry-pan or wok, thermometer</strong></p> <p><strong>300g fish fillets<br>Oyster sauce<br>Panko breadcrumbs (crushed rice </strong><strong>crispies</strong><strong> work well as a gluten free alternative)<br>1L rice bran oil<br>Wasabi<br>Kewpie mayonnaise<br>2 wraps<br></strong><strong>Soy sauce</strong><strong><br>1 lemon</strong><em>, cut into wedges</em><strong><br>1 cucumber</strong><em>, sliced</em></p> <p>Leave your flour and egg at home; you don’t need any of those for the perfect battered fish. Instead, cut the fillets into 2cm-wide strips, coat them in oyster sauce and roll them in the panko crumbs. You don’t need salt and pepper because all of those flavours are in the oyster sauce.</p> <p>In a wok or a deep pot like a camp oven, heat the oil to 180C and drop the fish in until it has lightly browned. It’ll keep on browning after you take it out, so bear that in mind.</p> <p>While the fillets are cooking, mix the wasabi and mayo to your liking. Even if you don’t like the spice of wasabi, a tiny bit adds a lot of freshness.</p> <p>Once the fish has cooked, spread a generous amount of wasabi mayo on to the wrap and add a few drops of soy sauce. Add the fish, a small squeeze of lemon, and some sliced cucumber, then wrap and enjoy.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This recipe is an edited extract from <a href=\"https://exploringedenbooks.com/shop/fire-to-fork/\">Fire to Fork</a>, available now through Exploring Eden (RRP: $39.95).</em></p></li> </ul>",

This jukebox show, first staged in the US almost a decade ago, was co-created by Roger Kumble, closely adapted from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/17/cruel-intentions-review-ryan-phillippe-sarah-michelle-gellar-reese-witherspoon\">1999 film</a> “suggested by” Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses.</p> <p>Cruel Intentions’ tale of Upper East Side teenage treachery, privilege and popped cherries came with a soundtrack bookended by Placebo’s Every You Every Me and the Verve’s Bitter Sweet Symphony. Along with Counting Crows’ Colorblind, those songs are reused here for the same scenes as the film. Added to the mix are hits by No Doubt, TLC and Ace of Base (The Sign greets an orgasm), plus a hummable snippet from the Dawson’s Creek theme.</p> <p>Performed by the company, Placebo’s opener is somewhat drained of doom and many of the songs are used for either comedic or romantic purposes. Often, the lyrics shrewdly match character or story. When Kathryn (Laclos’s Marquise de Merteuil) sets up a wager with stepbrother Sebastian (the Vicomte de Valmont), they plunge into Christina Aguilera’s Genie in a Bottle whose lustful unease mirrors their incestuous desire. In the film, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe had a silky, languorous connection but Jonathan O’Boyle’s production tends to race through scenes and throw away lines, including Kathryn’s promise that Sebastian can, ahem, “put it anywhere” if they go to bed.</p>    <p>First, Sebastian has to seduce the celibate Annette and he also pursues the younger Cecile. In one of the film’s most vexed scenes, he spikes Cecile’s drink and intimidates her before forcing oral sex on her. In the musical, while she is still unknowingly drinking alcohol and is blackmailed, the script includes a consensual reply to his proposition. It is among a handful of occasions where the show half-redresses behaviour in the film. Sebastian calls out the racism of Cecile’s mother (also satirised through her performance of No Scrubs) yet the film’s ableist and homophobic slurs pass unchecked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/feb/07/pump-up-the-volume-can-christian-slaters-teen-movie-become-a-musical-hit-like-heathers\">Pump Up the Volume: can Christian Slater’s teen movie become a musical hit like Heathers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Created by Kumble, Jordan Ross and Lindsey Rosin, it is performed on a hyper-active revolve stage with pop choreography by Gary Lloyd. Speeding through two dozen songs, occasionally combined – as in an awkward mashup of REM’s Losing My Religion and Meredith Brooks’ Bitch – you get the sense of hopping between music video channels, not least when schoolgirls who seem to have arrived from a Britney Spears video accompany a rendition of Just a Girl. But Garbage’s Only Happy When It Rains is a smart companion to Placebo and Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn deftly mirrors the shame felt by Sebastian and Annette.</p> <p>Polly Sullivan’s design has a dartboard-style floor and combines the story’s origins by using candelabras and school crests but it lacks seductive lustre and Sebastian’s attire looks cut price. Kathryn’s costumes are better and Rhianne-Louise McCaulsky is sensational in the role, exuding hauteur with the slightest hair toss. McCaulsky is matched well by Daniel Bravo, whose wavy curls recall Phillippe’s, and there are appealing professional debuts from Abbie Budden (Annette) and Rose Galbraith (Cecile), while Josh Barnett and Barney Wilkinson strengthen the film’s gay relationship. Nickcolia King-N’Da and Jess Buckby complete the cast whose confidence elevates a peppy musical that can’t quite calibrate the movie’s toxicity.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://theotherpalace.co.uk/cruel-intentions-the-90s-musical/\">the Other Palace, London</a>, until 14 April</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>At Sundance, a festival geared towards acquisition with unsold films going for the hard sell, there’s something intriguing about those that withhold. While for mysterious romance Love Me, the involvement of the Oscar nominees Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun was enough by itself to vault the film to the top of many wishlists, its logline was less of a sure thing. A post-apocalyptic love story between a buoy and a satellite was something that people would have to see to understand and so there was an unusual sense of curious excitement in the air at its packed-out premiere, no one quite sure what was about to be experienced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/19/freaky-tales-review-sundance-festival-pedro-pascal\">Freaky Tales review – Pedro Pascal-led 80s anthology isn’t freaky enough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while the curiosity might have sustained itself for the most part, the excitement slowly faded, the film an alluring but ultimately failed experiment. Rather than giving us something we truly haven’t seen before, it falls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/08/black-mirror-sci-fi-imitations-fingernails\">too closely in line with other recent films</a> that have felt less like standalone acts of original creation and more like discarded Black Mirror episodes. While not quite as deadening as Foe or Fingertips, it leaves us with a similar sense of frustration, the not particularly gratifying act of witnessing an idea being workshopped in real time, happier with itself than we are watching it.</p> <p>It starts with a bold, and bleak, look into the future. Humanity is long gone and a digitally assisted smart buoy (voiced by Stewart) is all alone. One day, it encounters a satellite (voiced by Yeun), charged with explaining the end of the world to any life form it might encounter. Their fractured communication starts to evolve into something more human as they develop a sense of what it is to be alive via shreds of a long-expired internet. As they get closer, they start to change form, modelled after two vacuous influencers, playing at being in love before starting to question what real love is.</p> <p>The first-time film-makers Sam and Andy Zuchero have certainly not picked the easy route with their debut, spanning billions of years and combining animation, live-action and some stunning, expansive visuals. But ambition only takes the film so far, a big swing aiming to comment on and cover so much, too much, that it deserves only admiration for trying rather than applause for succeeding. The initial scenes, which bring to mind the opening stretch of Wall-E, are the most endearing, as the two objects try to work out a way to communicate and define themselves. The swerve that follows, as the film turns the pair into animated avatars of the influencers that one of then covets, has its moments, with the pair stuck in an endless cycle of making Blue Apron spon-con trying to break out of the formula into something authentic. But the film’s grasp of the internet and its jabs at social media feel too broad and far too dated, repeatedly hammering easy targets into nothing.</p> <p>The Zucheros flit between almost compelling quandaries about the trap of idealised straight romance and the hell of expected performance within it to more rote and repetitive observations about gender. It’s all strangely stacked against its female character, who is painted as an irrational, deceitful nag, while its male lead is merely trying to find himself outside of the dynamic she has forced on to them. A more entertaining film might have turned this into a thriller but with its loudly beating heart on its sleeve, Love Me wants to be a sweeping romance instead, insisting us to reach emotional heights that the film just can’t take us to (a score that intercuts between lush Michael Giacchino-esque highs and intrusively annoying jazzy lows doesn’t help matters). It feels like a short that was expanded without enough thought for how it might work as a whole movie and by the end, even that curiosity has faded too.</p> <p>Like Stewart, Yeun has worked hard to distance himself from the limits of the genre franchise that made him, taking left-field turns when offered, picking actor over movie star, and this marks another interestingly offbeat choice for them both. They do what they can with their multiple personas but there’s forever a disconnect with what we’re being told and how we’re then made to feel, in a film wanting desperately to be loved that makes it near impossible.</p> <ul> <li><p>Love Me is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution</p></li> </ul>",

There is something underneath that: it is like an onion, the first layer, second layer … we have to go to the bottom of it to understand actually what is making us win or lose.</p> <p>“It is the small details, the margins, and then the boxes have played a big part of that. We have to change that. As a coach, you think: ‘Yeah, do that and that’s what will happen …’ It’s not. We have to find something else to win.”</p> <p>The Premier League’s spending restrictions mean that appears unlikely to come in the transfer market despite Arsenal’s long-term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/01/football-transfer-rumours-if-not-ivan-toney-then-which-striker-for-arsenal\">interest in Brentford’s Ivan Toney</a>, who returns on Saturday after his eight-month ban for gambling and is a more realistic target for the summer. It was perhaps telling that Arteta refused to answer when asked which position he could sign a player in if money were no object, insisting: “I love the players that we have.” But the manager did reveal Arsenal had been taking what he described as a “holistic approach” to improve their finishing, which included allowing the players to bring their families to Dubai to share “togetherness and moments”.</p> <p>“They are part of us,” Arteta said. “They live with us. Maybe they are not in the building every day but they live our professional lives, our success and failures every day. They need to be recognised. They need to be present and for me it’s part of the best moments that we had. We always try to take a holistic approach and look at every aspect that can be affecting the players in a positive or negative way.”</p> <p>Arteta played down interest from West Ham in taking Emile Smith Rowe on loan and was upbeat about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/16/arsenl-confirm-new-signing-jurrien-timber-needs-knee-surgery\">Jurrien Timber’s chances of featuring again</a> this season after the £34m summer signing stepped up his rehabilitation in Dubai.</p> <p>“There is a possibility but at the moment he’s still very far from competing,” he said. “That’s the realistic picture of it. Are we hopeful that he could have a realistic impact before the end of the season? If everything goes well, it looks like that might happen.

It’s not a popular opinion but if we had bought a right-back or centre-half, these boys would not have shown [their ability].”</p> <p>Klopp will come up against Andoni Iraola for the third time on Sunday after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/19/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">3-1 home win</a> in the league and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/01/bournemouth-liverpool-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">2-1 Carabao Cup victory</a> at Bournemouth. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2023/dec/15/how-bournemouth-form-team-premier-league-andoni-iraola-europe\">Iraola’s team have lost once</a> in their past eight league games after failing to win any of their opening nine fixtures after replacing Gary O’Neil. “I’m pretty sure at Bournemouth they smiled a lot recently and thought: ‘Oh my god it worked out,’” Klopp said. “It was brave and it worked out – I like that a lot. I respect that a lot. You can really see the impact of a coach and that always has my respect.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>‘That’s a good question,” Thomas Frank acknowledged, and it was far from the only one that the Brentford manager faced as he sat down to preview his team’s home game against Nottingham Forest on Saturday evening. Or, to bill it another way, and how everybody is doing: Ivan Toney’s comeback from an eight-month ban for betting offences. Is the Brentford striker fuelled by a sense of injustice?</p> <p>Surprisingly, it did not get a great answer because Frank is usually the man for a great answer; always ready to engage, to think deeply, to respond with extra layers. At one point, when he was asked about the potential for Toney to get stick from opposition fans, he brought up David Beckham post-1998 World Cup. “I hope that won’t happen but I know there will be some banter and probably more than banter and stick,” Frank said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/16/a-lonely-existence-ivan-toney-walks-well-worn-path-as-he-returns-from-ban\">‘A lonely existence’: Ivan Toney walks well-worn path as he returns from ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the injustice line, Frank agreed that it could provide “an edge” for Toney and it does feel like a fair starting point for an examination of the emotions that have raged within the player since November 2022 – maybe even before that. It is mainly because of how hard Toney has pushed it himself.</p> <p>The 27-year-old has given a clutch of interviews since last May when his suspension was announced after he pleaded guilty to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/ivan-toney-hit-with-eight-month-football-ban-for-breaching-fa-betting-rules-brentford\">232 breaches of the Football Association’s betting rules</a> over a near-four year period from February 2017.</p> <p>Toney spoke in more than one of them about his devastation at how “they” – meaning the FA – had “decided to bring it all out” in November 2022 just before Gareth Southgate named his England squad for the Qatar World Cup. The story about Toney being investigated for betting breaches was actually broken by a newspaper; it was hardly an FA press release and, at that point, he had not been charged.</p> <p>Toney felt the revelation made it impossible for Southgate to pick him and that when the England manager did not, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/12/manchester-city-couldnt-handle-brentfords-toney-admits-pep-guardiola\">missing the World Cup </a>was a bigger punishment than his eventual ban. But why did “they” wait until May to suspend him? “It’s like a double hit,” Toney told The Diary of a CEO podcast, hosted by Steven Bartlett. “I felt like someone was out to stop me from playing for England.”</p> <p>Toney also told Bartlett the authorities had made an example of him because of his standing; that players further down the leagues who had broken the betting rules had been punished less severely.</p> <p>It talks to another interesting theme: Toney’s apparent reluctance to apologise for what he has done. Is he sorry, Frank was asked. “I think he is also … he’s a big believer … of course, it’s not like he thinks it’s fantastic if you make a mistake,” Frank replied. “Let’s say in a football match, he is always holding his hand up if there is something he should have done better. Sorry is a big word. If it could be done different, yeah, I think he would have done but he moves on.”</p>    <p>This was the aspect that Frank wanted to push; Toney’s preternatural ability to live in the moment on the pitch, to immediately park anything that has just been. It is easy from the outside to paint Toney as some kind of avenger, ready to take out his frustration on the Forest defence. The way that Frank tells it, he is simply ready to take out the Forest defence because it is how he is wired.</p> <p>“The way he plays football is the way he lives his life,” Frank said. “If there’s something good, he still moves forward. Something bad or whatever, injustice … leave it in the past, move forward. He doesn’t play on anger. He plays on smiles, energy, positive thinking.</p> <p>“Ivan is so good at staying focused – next action, next shot, next pressing situation, next set, link-up. So leave the bad action behind or the good action and just build on the next one. That is a top ability and I think you see that in the top players.”</p> <p>Frank’s media conference was definitely better attended than normal and the Brentford press officer, Chris Wickham, got a laugh during his welcome address. “Just to let you know we’re not going to take any questions on Ivan Toney,” he said. Towards the end of it, Frank asked how many there had been. “Twenty-six? Yes?” he said. “Let’s hit 30! Come on, we can do that!”</p> <p>Toney’s comeback was described as the biggest in the Premier League since Eric Cantona’s from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/eric-cantona-kung-fu-kick-hooligan-25-years-later\">kung-fu kick</a> and Frank wanted to bring up another one – that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/christian-eriksen-comeback-for-brentford-against-newcastle\">Christian Eriksen for his Brentford team</a> in February 2022. It was Eriksen’s first appearance since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/12/denmark-v-finland-match-suspended-after-christian-eriksen-collapses\">cardiac arrest</a> during Denmark’s opening European Championship tie in June 2021.</p> <p>“It’s different but I compare it a little bit to Christian – also he was not ‘injured’ if that makes sense,” Frank said. “Of course, it was a crazy thing that happened to him but he hit the ground running and I&nbsp;expect the same from Ivan.”</p> <p>Where Frank did see a parallel between Toney and Cantona was in their supreme self-confidence. “There’s a story with our defender Charlie Goode, who is a good friend of Ivan’s,” Frank said. “When Ivan came to the club [from Peterborough in 2020] and didn’t score for the first four games, Charlie said to him: ‘Are you OK?’ Ivan said: ‘Yeah, I’ll smash the scoring record in the Championship, I will score more than 30 goals.’ Which he did. He has got that confidence. He believes he can score in every action.”</p> <p>There remain so many uncomfortable elements to the Toney saga. When he was first interviewed by the FA in May 2022, he said that he had not bet on matches. Only later would he admit to doing so, albeit there was a caveat in his interview with Bartlett. “There were bets in the 232 that I didn’t recall making but I was willing to take responsibility just to get the process all over and done with,” Toney said.</p> <p>Toney told Bartlett he “didn’t lie … I just couldn’t remember what they were asking for – until they brought certain things in front of me.” Then there was the line: “If I just deny it, it’s all fine – they wouldn’t find anything.”</p> <p>Toney’s admission to Sky this week that he did not know whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/17/ivan-toney-states-desire-to-play-for-top-club-after-gambling-ban-comes-to-end\">move he wants to a top club</a> could come this month was poorly judged, although it probably spoke more to his insatiable desire. He has had to battle to protect his mental health, particularly during the first four months of his ban when he was not allowed to train with Brentford. There has also been the reality of his gambling addiction.</p> <p>Toney wants to move on. “He’s like an eight-year-old boy who just has the pure joy of playing football,” Frank said, while confirming that Toney would start against Forest and wear the captain’s armband in the absence of the injured Christian Nørgaard.</p> <p>Even without Toney, the game would have been high profile: injury-hit Brentford desperate to end a five-game losing streak against a Forest team one place above them in 15th and reeling from the announcement they face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/15/premier-league-charge-nottingham-forest-everton\">possible points deduction</a> for breaking financial rules. With Toney, it is a blockbuster.</p> <p>“It’s perfect timing for Ivan, it’s classic Ivan,” Frank said. “It could have been away, a 12.30pm kick-off, but now it’s at home, under the floodlights at 5.30pm and a little bit on the game, I would say. He will just thrive on that environment.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Joe Biden on Friday <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-signs-continuing-resolution-government-shutdown/\">signed</a> a measure to keep the US government funded but as Washington shivered under its second major snowfall in a week, the bill did not unfreeze funding for Ukraine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/19/unconditional-support-israel-netanyahu-jayal-democrats\">US should ‘reset relationship of unconditional support’ for Israel, progressives say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hard-right House Republicans, led by the speaker, Mike Johnson, are ensuring the chances of more money and weapons for Kyiv in its fight with Moscow hinge on negotiations for immigration reform.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the president welcomed Johnson and other senior Republicans, as well as Democratic leaders, to the White House for talks.</p> <p>Though the meeting ended with the two sides still short of agreement on immigration and the southern border, Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, said he was optimistic a deal could be struck and aid to Ukraine thereby put back on the table.</p> <p>“Once Congress avoids a shutdown, it is my goal for the Senate to move forward to the national security supplemental as soon as possible,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1748060419606839386\">said</a>. “Our national security, our friends abroad, and the future of democracy demands nothing less.”</p> <p>On Friday, addressing a group of mayors at the White House, Biden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DJJudd/status/1748459024012484754\">said</a> he was “ready to act” and believed, “God willing and the creek not rising”, the Senate would agree an immigration deal.</p> <p>“The question for the speaker and the House Republicans,” Biden said, was: “Are they ready?”</p> <p>After the Wednesday White House meeting, however, Johnson <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-speaker-johnson-border-security-ukraine-government-shutdown-fa505e84f1ffd1767eb01a250a161393\">told reporters</a>: “We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine. But the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security.”</p> <p>Many observers suggest Republicans do not want a deal on immigration and the southern border, instead using the issue, and the concept of more aid for Ukraine, as clubs with which to attack Biden in an election year.</p> <p>“The GOP is more interested in nursing grievances and stoking anger than actually solving problems,” Eugene Robinson, a Washington Post columnist, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/18/house-republicans-no-immigration-deal/\">wrote</a>. “That’s exactly what Donald Trump has trained them to do.”</p> <p>Robinson went on to quote the Texas congressman Troy Nehls, who this month <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/03/politics/senate-immigration-negotiations-congress/index.html\">told CNN</a>: “Let me tell you, I’m not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden’s approval rating. I will not help the Democrats try to improve this man’s dismal approval ratings. I’m not going to do it. Why would I?”</p> <p>Amid such familiar dysfunction, one slightly dystopian possibility stood out: Democrats, senior party figures said, might provide the votes to keep Johnson as speaker – against a likely rebellion from his right – should he bring any Senate deal on immigration to the House floor, thereby putting Ukraine aid back on the table.</p> <p>“Our job is not to save Johnson but I think it would be a mighty pity, if he did the right thing … for us not to support him,” Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the ranking Democrat on the House homeland security committee, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/19/democrats-johnson-ukraine-border-deal-00136568\">told Politico</a>. “Up to this point, he’s been a fairly honest broker.”</p> <p>In October, Democrats could have saved Johnson’s predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, from becoming the first speaker ever ejected by his own party – but chose not to.</p> <p>Whether stoked by Trumpist isolationism or by equally Trumpist authoritarianism, and therefore preference for Vladimir Putin and Moscow, resistance to aid for Ukraine remains strong among Republicans in Congress.</p> <p>But the party is not united. On the presidential campaign trail, Trump’s closest challenger for the Republican nomination, the former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley, told voters in New Hampshire on Thursday that though the US did not “need to put troops on the ground anywhere … what you do have to do is deter.</p> <p>“There’s a reason the Taiwanese want the US and the west to support Ukraine. Because they know if Ukraine wins, China won’t invade Taiwan.”</p> <p>Haley also linked Ukraine aid to helping Israel against Hamas – another issue awaiting discussion should immigration talks succeed.</p> <p>In the House, Michael McCaul, chair of the foreign affairs committee, tried a more emotive tactic, appealing to Republicans’ better angels – or at least to their foreign policy traditions.</p> <p>Johnson, McCaul <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/19/ukraine-aid-cut-likely-johnson-house-republicans/\">told the Post</a>, “is going to have to make a hard decision about what to do. If we abandon our Nato allies and surrender to Putin in Ukraine, it’s not going to make the world safer, it’s going to make the world more dangerous … [Ronald] Reagan would never have surrendered to the Soviet Union. Maybe that’s a shift in our party.”</p> <p>Most observers would suggest that it is, Republicans long having surrendered to Trump. In his own contribution to the debate over whether to do a deal on immigration and get back to supporting Ukraine, Trump struck a predictably harsh note, clearly meant to stiffen Johnson’s spine.</p> <p>“I do not think we should do a border deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION,” the former president wrote on his social media platform.</p> <p>“Also, I have no doubt that our wonderful speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, will only make a deal that is PERFECT ON THE BORDER.”</p>",

Let’s go find Swalwell and get this over with. I’m just not putting up with this shit any more.”</p> <p>Swalwell and Nadler were prominent Trump opponents during his time in office. In 2020, as chair of the House judiciary committee, Nadler said he would investigate Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/10/roger-stone-trump-commutes-prison-sentence\">commutation</a> of a jail sentence handed to Stone for obstructing the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow.</p> <p>This week, Nadler said he had been in communication with US Capitol police and the FBI about Stone’s alleged remark.</p> <p>On Thursday, Swalwell <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RxI4BolBKg\">told Scripps</a>: “The message I send to Roger Stone is: ‘I’m not going away.’ We’re not going to be intimidated. We must be a country where we settle our scores not with violence, but with voting.”</p> <p>Stone says the recording is a fake, while his associate, Sal Greco, has dismissed it as “political fodder”.</p> <p>Stone’s lawyer, David Schoen – who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/01/trump-impeachment-attorneys-david-schoen-bruce-castor\">defended Trump</a> in his second impeachment trial, for inciting the January 6 attack on Congress – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RxI4BolBKg\">told Scripps</a> Stone had had “two experts look at” the recording.</p> <p>“It’s a 92% chance or higher that it’s AI-generated,” Schoen said. “I’m sure that if he said it, that he didn’t mean literally those words. He doesn’t speak that way. He’s got zero history of violence, ever. I know him pretty well, and I think it’s an absolutely crazy charge.”</p>",

The documentary opens in the middle of their headline-making attempt to climb Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia – the world’s second-tallest building and heavily guarded during the final phase of its construction – while guards were distracted during the World Cup final in December 2022, prompting an investigation by Malaysian authorities.</p> <p>Filmed over six years in six different countries, Skywalkers, from the directors Jeff Zimbalist and Maria Bukhonina, traces the duo’s entry into the controversial sport of “rooftopping” – in which climbers scale buildings, spires, cranes or other man-made structures without safety harnesses – separately in Russia, and then together, as well as the factors, including social media crackdowns in Russia and the invasion of Ukraine, that drove them to illegally climb Merdeka.</p> <p>Beerkus, a talented climber and cameraman, first developed a following on social media for his extreme rooftop selfies, with nothing between him and the camera but thousands of feet to fall; his work garnered sponsors who funded riskier ventures and greater heights around the world. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, grew up with her grandmother in Kostroma, Russia, after her father abandoned the family and her mother sank into crippling depression. She says she turned to rooftopping as a means of legacy and escape, garnering a following for her gymnastics poses on the edge of buildings.</p> <p>Individually, the two eked out livings via the extreme, highly dangerous sport (at one point in the film, Nikolau learns that most of her former Moscow rooftopping crew are “gone” – dead from falls). Together, the two made better money with the narrative of their love – and high-altitude kiss selfies – while scaling a who’s who of structures.</p> <p>The film uses rooftopping – or as the couple refers to it, given their artistic flourishes, “skywalking” – as a metaphor for romantic trust, a notion particularly difficult for Nikolau, whose motto was “never rely on anyone except yourself”. It presents their line of work as a heist-like art of avoiding detection by authorities, listing the couple’s numerous strategies for deception, trespassing and disguise. “We’re just artists filming the city from up high,” says Beerkus after they’re spotted and arrested scaling a cathedral in Paris. The two claim to value “clean work” and, though they do not downplay the risks, argue for the justification of rooftopping as art and sport first. In doing illegal stunts that push one’s luck, Nikolau invokes an old circus saying: “Our full potential is on the other side of fear.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlEyZDPaqiw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlEyZDPaqiw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It’s not an adrenaline addiction, she claims at one point. “It’s a commitment to self-growth.”</p> <p>Skywalkers also delves into the financial pressures contributing to the couple’s ever-riskier attempts, culminating with a planned acrobatic hold atop Merdeka, which is billed in the film logline as a stunt to “salvage both their career and relationship”. Before the pandemic, the couple made a living through sponsorships on Instagram, which funded their travel, gear and other expenses in exchange for death-defying footage. Covid, they say, cut off such money, forcing Nikolau to turn to modeling and making product placement social media content to support them. The invasion of Ukraine, which prompted a social media and censorship crackdown in Russia, decimated what income remained, lest either of the two take an office job (Beerkus’s parents unsuccessfully push him to take a “trading” job with a family friend). In a last-ditch attempt to make money, the couple turned to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) derived from their stunt footage to make a living. Nikolau also makes paintings from sex toy materials, according to her Instagram.</p> <p>The summit of Merdeka tower – a “virgin tower”, as Nikolau puts it, since no one had scaled it – two groups were arrested en route before their attempt – is pitched as a comeback attempt to make cash through a fickle, upstart new field. Beerkus says they spent the last of their money on plane tickets to Bangkok, Thailand, a less prosecutorial country that Malaysia where they trained for several months. The final third of the documentary has the feeling of a heist film, as the two scope out Merdeka tower through sources, building plans and hired drones and practice their sense-defying acrobatic lift – Beerkus holding Nikolau above his head, her limbs outstretched – for the top of the spire.</p> <p>The film’s production and high risk recalls Free Solo, in which the directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi struggled with the ethical implications of potentially filming Honnold’s death as he climbed Yosemite’s El Capitan without a rope. Free Solo was a critical hit when it premiered at the 2018 Telluride and Toronto international film festivals, and went on to win the Oscar for best documentary.</p> <p>The film is currently seeking distribution at Sundance.</p>",

But in August, prosecutors said they were considering re-filing the charges after a new analysis of the weapon was completed.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gun-analysis-alec-baldwin-rust-new-mexico-33eb5260eac436b7d10a15744dc64d67\">report</a> from experts in ballistics and forensic testing, commissioned by the prosecutors, said: “Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver.”</p> <p>Prosecutors brought the new<strong> </strong>case before a grand jury in Santa Fe this week.</p> <p>“We look forward to our day in court,” Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, defense attorneys for Baldwin, said in an email on Friday.</p> <p>Baldwin and his co-producers are also facing civil lawsuits seeking financial compensation, including from members of the Rust crew, but judges have put those cases on hold while the criminal matter proceeds.</p> <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the weapons supervisor for Rust, was previously charged with involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering and her trial is scheduled for February.</p> <p>Gutierrez-Reed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/10/rust-shooting-halyna-hutchins-hannah-gutierrez-reed-trial-case-death#:~:text=Rust%20armorer%20Hannah%20Gutierrez%20Reed,an%20arraignment%20and%20preliminary%20hearing.\">pleaded not guilty last year</a>. Prosecutors have alleged that she acted in a reckless manner when she handed the loaded gun to Baldwin on set and have accused her of failing to ensure that all the rounds in the firearm were dummies. Gutierrez-Reed has also been accused of drinking in the evening before the fatal incident, with prosecutors suggesting she was hungover during the shooting.</p> <p>The tampering charge stems from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/arts/rust-armorer-cocaine.html\">allegations</a> that Gutierrez-Reed had given a small bag of cocaine to someone else after she was questioned by police.</p> <p>Gutierrez-Reed’s lawyers, who previously sought to have the involuntary manslaughter charges against her dismissed, accused prosecutors of mishandling the case and attempting a “character assassination” of their client.</p> <p>A former special prosecutor on the case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/15/rust-shooting-special-prosector-steps-down-alec-baldwin\">stepped down last year</a> after Baldwin’s attorneys sought her removal due to her role as a state representative in the legislature.</p> <p>David Halls, the film’s assistant director and safety coordinator, pleaded no contest to unsafe handling of a firearm last March. He has cooperated in the investigation and was given a sentence of six months probation. He and Baldwin have <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/rust-assistant-director-david-halls-sentenced-deadly-set/story?id=98268586\">said</a> they were unaware there were live rounds in the gun. When the charges against Baldwin were dropped last year, Halls’s lawyer <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/baldwin-manslaughter-charged-dismissed-c4b2928da21ee4ff00a51d2e4eddd7dc\">said</a>: “Mr Halls never believed Mr Baldwin should be charged with a crime. It was a tragic accident that is best resolved out of criminal court.”</p> <p>The Rust Movie Productions company has also paid a $100,000 fine to New Mexico workplace safety regulators. The firm was accused of violating industry protocols and failing to remedy issues that arose after there were two misfires on the set prior to Hutchins’s killing.</p> <p>Rust resumed production in April of last year. Matthew Hutchins, the husband of the late cinematographer, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/20/alec-baldwins-rust-movie-to-resume-filming-18-months-after-shooting\">negotiated</a> an agreement for him to become an executive producer on the film.</p> <p>The tragedy has rippled across Hollywood and led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/20/gun-safety-movie-sets-alec-baldwin-rust-shooting\">improvements in gun safety</a>, industry experts have said.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

It has rallied more than 17% since late October.</p> <p>Earlier in the day,<strong> </strong>an influential survey<strong> </strong>showed that consumer sentiment soared 13% in January to reach its highest level since July 2021.</p> <p>The University of Michigan’s monthly <a href=\"http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">consumer sentiment index</a> rose 9.1 points to 78.8, the biggest monthly advance since 2005 and far exceeding expectations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/19/us-inflation-caused-by-corporate-profits\">Half of recent US inflation due to high corporate profits, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The news came after a similarly sharp rise in December. Joanne Hsu, University of Michigan’s director of surveys, said that over the last two months, sentiment has climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession ended.</p> <p>“Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,” said Hsu.</p> <p>The rise was driven in large part by expectations that the rate of inflation will continue to decline. The survey found that consumers expect prices to climb at an annual rate of 2.9% over the next year, down from the 3.1% reported in December. Expectations about price rises over the next five to 10 years hit a four-month low of 2.8%.</p> <p>Consumers have consistently reported feeling gloomy about the economy since the end of the pandemic. Those reports have come even as unemployment hovers close to a 50-year low, stock markets have soared and the wider economy has remained resilient.</p> <p>The disconnect has puzzled economists and presented the Biden administration with a major dilemma ahead of the 2024 election. Joe Biden has made “Bidenomics” – his economic recovery program – a central plank of his re-election campaign. But surveys show it has so far met with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/15/biden-economy-bidenomics-poll-republicans-democrats-independents\">little enthusiasm</a> from voters.</p> <p>Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House council of economic advisers, hailed the survey as proof that Biden’s policies are working.</p> <p>“We have more work to do, but we’re on the right path as we execute President Biden’s agenda, and people are starting to feel it,” Bernstein said. “That’s a sharp contrast with congressional Republicans’ plans to cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations while raising healthcare and prescription drug costs for hard-working American families.”</p> <p>The Michigan survey is the latest in a series that indicate the national mood may be changing. A survey from the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240108\">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a> released earlier this month found consumers expected inflation to ease over the short, medium and long term and expectations about credit access and households’ financial situation were less pessimistic.</p> <p>In December the Conference Board reported 2023 had ended with a surge in consumer confidence. The research group’s closely watched <a href=\"https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence\">consumer confidence survey</a> rose to levels last seen in July.</p>",

They were joined by 11 fellow House Democrats: Jake Auchincloss, Rebecca Balint, Suzanne Bonamici, Steve Cohen, Daniel Goldman, Seth Magaziner, Mike Levin, Dean Phillips, Jan Schakowsky, Kim Schrier and Bradley Sherman.</p> <p>In a separate statement, the Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid predicted that “continuing to unconditionally fund Israel’s war in Gaza” would cost him enough votes to doom Joe Biden’s campaign to be re-elected as president.</p> <p>“He will break a fundamental trust with many Democrats,” said Shahid, a former spokesperson for the progressive political action committee Justice Democrats. Shahid also warned that “lecturing about the greater evil” represented by the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump, would do “little” to repair it.</p> <p>Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/28/donald-trump-investigations-criminal-charges-tracker\">facing more than 90 pending criminal charges</a> for attempting to forcibly overturn his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election, illegally retaining government secrets after he left the Oval Office, and hush-money payments to an adult film actor who has alleged an extramarital sexual encounter with him. He has also been grappling with civil litigation over his business practices and a rape accusation which a judge has determined to be substantially true.</p> <p>“I pray, for all our sakes, that Biden corrects course – because our country cannot afford to pay the bill for disregarding Palestinian lives should it come due in November,” Shahid said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said the president and Netanyahu discussed “post-conflict Gaza” on Friday by telephone, as the foreign policy reporter Laura Rozen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/1748420076447867060\">wrote</a> on the social media platform X.</p> <p>Biden made clear that “an independent Palestinian state” was important for long-term security, Kirby remarked, as reported by Rozen.</p> <p>“The president still believes in the promise and the possibility of a two state solution,” Kirby said, in part, according to Rozen. “And the United States stands firmly committed to eventually seeing that outcome.”</p> <p>Despite occasionally endorsing the concept, Netanyahu has worked to obstruct the establishment of a Palestinian state throughout his political career.</p> <p>His statements on Thursday were his most pointed attack on the US’s preferred foreign policy approach in Gaza, however.</p> <p>It came after Biden’s administration had spent enormous domestic political capital – and billions of dollars in aid – to support Israel’s military in its strikes there.</p> <p>Israel, which receives $3.8bn annually in security assistance from the US, mounted the offensive in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack by Hamas that killed about 1,200. Israeli military operations in Gaza have since killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p> <p>Netanyahu’s comments on Thursday came two days after US senators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/16/bernie-sanders-senate-test-vote-military-aid-israel#:~:text=US%20senators%20have%20defeated%20a,its%20devastating%20war%20in%20Gaza.\">defeated</a> a measure from the progressive Bernie Sanders that would have made military aid to Israel conditional on whether the Israeli government is violating human rights and international accords with its offensive in Gaza.</p> <p>Biden’s White House opposed Sanders’s proposal and has asked Congress to approve an additional $14bn for Israel.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Hello and welcome to the weekend – I hope it was a good week.</p> <p>I’m back with our usual mix of good things to read from around the Guardian. If you’re after something longer, pick up a title from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/19/pulp-page-turners-and-pure-joy-the-ultimate-summer-reading-list-picked-by-you\">our readers’ list of ultimate summer books</a>. Or try Japanese author Mieko Kawakami’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/12/mieko-kawakami-franz-kafka-is-my-comfort-read\">comfort read</a> … Kafka. If you find books about interminable corridors and giant insects stressful (weird of you), you can just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/17/shelf-absorbed-nine-ways-to-arrange-your-bookshelves-and-what-they-say-about-you\">use them as decorations</a>! But speaking of interior design …</p> <h2>1. Cafes: why do they all look like this?</h2>    <p>Barista existentialism comes for us all. This particular question has been on people’s minds for a while, at least since Broadsheet went meta <a href=\"https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/art-and-design/article/design-question\">in 2015</a> and pondered its own impact on the Melbourne design landscape. The year after, New York writer Kyle Chayka coined the term “AirSpace” for that feeling of sameness in so many contemporary spots – from workplaces to Airbnbs, and especially, cafes and restaurants.</p> <p><strong>His theory then:</strong> businesses trying to woo crowds “moulded by the internet” inevitably copied styles that worked – and lo, “the cycle of aesthetic optimisation and homogenisation continued”.</p> <p><strong>His theory now:</strong> the trappings (white tiles, millennial pink, added or subtracted potted plants) might change; what stays the same is the sameness itself. Grim – but with a ring of truth; think about the last place you ordered coffee. And read more about it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/jan/16/the-tyranny-of-the-algorithm-why-every-coffee-shop-looks-the-same\">in this excerpt of Chayka’s new book</a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>a bit less than 10 minutes</p> <h2>2. ‘He chose to be kind’</h2>    <p>I’ve shared Ranjana Srivastava’s column here before, but this on Wednesday nearly made me cry. The author and oncologist this week described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/17/when-my-doctor-couldnt-save-my-pregnancy-he-did-the-next-best-thing\">a transformative act of kindness from her own doctor</a>.</p> <p>When she lost a previously healthy midterm twin pregnancy, Srivastava found herself “stranded” in grief. “More used to giving care than receiving, I turned against myself,” she writes. For weeks, she pushed down the tears, the instinct to mourn – telling herself her situation wasn’t so bad, relatively speaking. And one afternoon, a letter from her doctor arrived.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Dear Ranjana,</em></p> <p><em>I trust you are coping OK after the very sad events of recent weeks.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It’s so hard sometimes, when someone around you goes through something awful, to know what to say.</p> <p><strong>Here’s one idea </strong>(straight from that simple, beautiful letter)<strong>: </strong>“It must have been so hard.”</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>two-and-a-half minutes</p> <h2>3. A refugee camp in Beirut</h2>    <p>In the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon, there are no fences or checkpoints to stop people coming or going. But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/18/shatila-refugee-camp-lebanon-generations-of-palestinians-lost-their-futures\">Ghaith Abdul-Ahad finds</a>, “a mix of draconian laws, discrimination and prejudice has ensured that it feels as claustrophobic as any camp enclosed by high concrete walls”.</p> <p>He speaks to residents for a deft and urgent portrait of this “temporary” city inside a city – there since a group Palestinian refugees pitched camp “on a piece of wasteland” 70 years ago. It is now a cramped and dangerous home to somewhere between 14,000 and 40,000 people. And could, as Israel’s bombardment of Gaza continues, become home to many more.</p> <p>***</p> <p>“What is happening now in the camp is worse than any war. Young men are dying from drugs. A whole generation is wasting their lives.” <em>– a friend of the youngest son of Suhaila, one of the women interviewed here</em></p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>at least 15 minutes</p> <p><strong>Further reading: </strong>you can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war\">find our full coverage of the crisis in Gaza here</a>.</p> <h2>4. Ritual humiliation as therapy</h2>    <p>Social humiliation as medicine … it’s an idea, I guess. One that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/13/an-experiment-in-ritual-humiliation-would-a-month-of-rejection-therapy-make-me-fearless\">Joe Stone decided to try out</a>, committing (with the vaguely sadistic backing of his therapist) to “placing himself in the path of rejection” every day for a month.</p> <p><strong>The idea:</strong> that getting rejected can help you get over your fear of rejection – came from a card game, and then took off on TikTok.</p> <p><strong>Sounds horrible. </strong>Well, kind of. And honestly Stone’s 30-day diary doesn’t make me desperate to run out and try it. But he does include some slightly more “try-this-at-home” advice there too.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>six or so minutes</p> <h2>5. Maybe it’s time to be nicer to yourself</h2>    <p>So, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/jan/17/how-to-break-bad-habits\">as Elle Hunt notes</a>, most people give resolutions up by mid-January. But is that so bad? Why all the perfectionism? For all the self-awareness about the dangers of too much self-improvement, we do seem to talk about it a lot.</p> <p>“If anything, the discourse can make me feel mutinous,” Hunt writes, “like I want to eat, drink and vape myself silly in a stand against [it all].” This is highly relatable, but as she acknowledges, doesn’t get rid of that nagging feeling there are some vices you really should quit.</p> <p><strong>A different approach: </strong>“Instead of giving up our pleasures, we might aim to bring more and different ones in – to reconcile our real and ideal selves, or at least bring them closer together.”</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>three-and-a-half minutes, maybe four</p> <p>That’s me for now – go and have a little treat.</p>    <h2>Sign up</h2> <p>If you would like to receive these Five Great Reads to your email inbox every weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories?CMP=copyembed\">sign up here</a>.

I don’t know. I’m happy to win.</p> <p>“Earlier on in the quarters, obviously I hit the nine against Nathan, but I played well yesterday and I’ve played well again tonight. No one probably believes it, but I’ve not thrown a dart since the world final. Yesterday, that was the first proper practice I’ve put in, but it’s all paid off.</p> <p>“I’m just happy to win, obviously, against Michael. He’s still one of the best, he’s the very best and I’m just happy to win on my debut.”</p> <p>Van Gerwen was magnanimous in defeat, but urged people not to put pressure on the game’s new potential superstar. He said: “Everyone says he’s the new kid, but everyone knows what he is capable of. The crowd, the television, everyone wants to make him bigger, but he’s already a good player.</p> <p>“I know we all want to push him, but let him grow, let him do other things. You have to learn, the crowd has to learn and everyone who is involved in television has to learn. Don’t push him too much. Of course we know he’s a good player, but give him his time and after, he will come, no problems.”</p> <p>Littler threw first in the final and, with the first seven legs all going with the darts, took a 4-3 lead into the break. He edged in front with the first break on his return but the Dutchman took out 85 with outer bull and two double tops to reduce the deficit in the next before levelling at 5-5.</p> <p>But as both players struggled to land doubles, it was the youngster who held his nerve and having audaciously left himself 170 in the 13th leg, checked out with single 18 and double top to win 8-5.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OfficialPDC/status/1748393857169961312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">LUKE LITTLER HITS A NINE-DARTER! \uD83D\uDEA8<br><br>More history from the 16-year-old sensation!!! \uD83C\uDF1F <a href=\"https://t.co/o23C5P6AqL\">pic.twitter.com/o23C5P6AqL</a></p>&mdash; PDC Darts (@OfficialPDC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OfficialPDC/status/1748393857169961312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 19, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>As absorbing a final as it was, it lacked the fireworks of Littler’s earlier matches, which started with a nine-darter in the first leg of his 6-3 last-eight win over compatriot Aspinall. That booked him a semi-final clash with another former world champion in Price – who had beaten newly crowned world champion Humphries 6-4 in the previous round – and the contest was a little less explosive.</p> <p>Littler, who turns 17 on Sunday, landed a maximum 170 finish on his way to a 7-3 win over the Welshman, who himself hit 124 and 146 check-outs as he attempted to keep pace.

The total area is nearly three times the size of Yellowstone national park.</p> <p>“It’s eye-opening – it’s breathtaking in scale,” said Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who was not involved in the study.</p> <p>The reef was found at depths ranging from 655 feet to 3,280 feet (200 to 1,000 meters), where sunlight doesn’t penetrate. Unlike tropical coral reefs, where photosynthesis is important for growth, coral this far down must filter food particles out of the water for energy.</p> <p>Deep coral reefs provide habitat for sharks, swordfish, sea stars, octopuses, shrimp and many other kinds of fish, the scientists said.</p> <p>Tropical reefs are better known to scientists, and snorkelers or divers, because they’re more accessible. The world’s largest tropical coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, stretches for about 1,430 miles (2,300km).</p> <p>Sowers said it’s possible that larger deep-sea reefs will be discovered in the future since only about 25% of the world’s ocean floor has been mapped in high resolution.</p> <p>Maps of the ocean floor are created using high-resolution sonar devices carried on ships. Deep-sea reefs cover more of the ocean floor than tropical reefs.</p> <p>Both kinds of habitat are susceptible to climate change and disturbance from oil and gas drilling, said Erik Cordes, a marine biologist at Temple University and co-author of the new study.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

Wade paid for a ticket for himself and for Willis. Separately, on the same date and without any names attached, the statement shows Wade’s credit card was used to make two purchases with Royal Caribbean Cruises, for $1,284 and $1,387.</p> <p>The second trip, dated 25 April 2023, involves a flight from Atlanta to San Francisco. Wade again paid for a ticket for himself and for Willis. Separately, on 14 May 2023, Wade’s credit card was used to make two purchases of $612 and $228 with a Doubletree hotel in Napa Valley, California.</p> <p>Roman’s motion claimed Willis personally profited from the contract. Wade was paid at least $653,000 and potentially as much as $1m for legal fees as one of the lead prosecutors on the Trump case, and the filing alleged Wade then paid for trips he took with Willis to Napa Valley and the Caribbean.</p> <p>The motion included no proof of the allegations. Roman’s lawyer Ashleigh Merchant, a respected local attorney who publicly endorsed Wade when he ran to be a Cobb county superior judge 2016, has said the claims were based on sources and records from Wade’s divorce proceeding that remains under seal.</p> <p>Willis has not directly addressed the allegations, and a spokesperson has said the district attorney’s office would speak through its court filings.</p> <p>The allegations are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/18/fani-willis-misconduct-hearing-nathan-wade-relationship-trump-georgia\">scheduled to be addressed next month</a> after the Fulton county superior court judge Scott McAfee, who is presiding in the Trump case, set an evidentiary hearing for 15 February. The date comes two weeks after the judge in the divorce case holds a hearing on whether to unseal.</p> <p>Wade started divorce proceedings the day after he was hired as a special prosecutor on the Trump case. The divorce turned contentious last year, after Jocelyn Mayfield Wade complained that her husband had failed to disclose his finances, including income from working on the Trump case.</p> <p>The complaint resulted in Wade being held in contempt by the Cobb county superior court judge Henry Thompson and, in January, Willis herself was subpoenaed for information relating to Wade’s work. The subpoena ordered her to sit for a taped deposition on 23 January.</p> <p>On Thursday, Willis accused Wade’s wife of “conspiring with interested parties in the criminal election interference case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass and oppress District Attorney Willis” in a motion to quash, and sought a protective order to avoid the deposition.</p> <p>The court filing with Wade’s bank records attached as exhibits was submitted by Jocelyn Mayfield Wade’s lawyer on Friday.

The left faction convener argued that the “vast majority of the world recognises Israeli sovereignty only within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/28/the-two-state-solution-in-the-middle-east-all-you-need-to-know\">1967 borders</a>”.</p> <p>The condemnation of the Israeli prime minister’s position appears to put Hill at odds with his own leader, Anthony Albanese, who declared on Friday that Australia’s support for “the existence of the state of Israel is completely unconditional”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The Albanese Labor government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/08/australia-to-officially-resume-use-of-term-occupied-palestinian-territories-reversing-coalition-stance\">reinstated the term “Occupied Palestinian Territories”</a> and long supported a two-state solution. Hill is more outspoken than the foreign minister, Penny Wong, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/17/penny-wong-meets-palestinian-leaders-as-she-continues-calls-for-peace\">this week called for a “pathway to a Palestinian state”</a> on her visit to the Middle East.</p> <p>After Netanyahu declared that all territory west of the Jordan River should be under Israeli security control, the White House responded by saying the US would continue working towards a two-state solution and that there could be no Israeli reoccupation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> when the war concluded.</p> <p>Hill told Guardian Australia: “Amidst the ongoing hostage crisis and the horrors in Gaza, we must maintain focus on a sustainable resolution to this decades old conflict and Australia’s longstanding support for a two State solution.”</p> <p>“The grave implication of Netanyahu’s comments is that he is hellbent on formalising a policy of apartheid.

The term has been used in that context by <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution\">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/05/amnesty-israel-apartheid-israeli-politicians-agree\">Amnesty International</a>, Israel’s former attorney general, Michael Ben-Yair, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/israel-imposing-apartheid-on-palestinians-says-former-mossad-chief\">the former head of Israel’s intelligence agency the Mossad, Tamir Pardo</a>.</p> <p>Hill said the declaration “demands an urgent international response” including fast-tracking Palestinian statehood and “tough action to curb and reverse illegal Israeli settlements and extremist settler violence in the West Bank”.</p> <p>“Without action now then a viable Palestinian State will soon be impossible and conflict in the Middle East further inflamed.”</p> <p>Hill praised Wong for engaging with “victims of Hamas and extremist settlers” on her trip. But he argued more needs to be done to impose “financial sanctions” on construction, finance and agricultural companies “directly linked to settler violence and Palestinian dispossession” and to ensure that Australia’s relationship with Israel ends at its 1967 borders.</p> <p>Australia should not be an “active or passive” participant in Israel’s settlements which “breach international law,” he said.</p> <p>“There is no reason for Australia to delay imposing entry visa bans for extremist settlers, as has already occurred in the USA, UK and likely the EU. Let’s get on with it.</p> <p>“Tougher measures targeted at terrorist group Hamas, including wider financial sanctions, would be welcome. Consistency is important and terrorist-like activity by extremist settlers also demands determined responses.”</p> <p>Hill has also called for clarification that Australia’s double taxation convention with Israel “only applies to land within the 1967 borders”, like equivalent EU and US agreements.</p> <p>“Australians cannot donate money to terrorist group Hamas and there is no defensible reason why Australians should continue to be able to financially support illegal settlements or settler activities, let alone get tax deductions for doing so,” he said.</p> <p>In December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/australia-denounces-israeli-settler-attacks-on-palestinians-in-occupied-west-bank\">Australia joined allies, including the UK, Canada and France</a>, in warning that violent acts by Israeli settlers were “terrorising Palestinian communities” in the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>Hill’s comments follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/15/labor-mp-urges-crackdown-on-australians-funding-israeli-settlements-in-west-bank\">an intervention last week</a> calling for more action against illegal Israeli settlements.</p> <p>Wong has condemned settler violence but declined to speculate on policy responses.</p> <p>“Attacking Palestinians where they have a right to be is the wrong thing to do and certainly not conducive to ensuring there isn’t escalation,” the foreign minister said in response to Hill’s earlier intervention.</p> <p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive, Alex Ryvchin, rejected Hill’s previous statements about settlements. He said: “Instead of expressing solidarity with the hostages and with brave soldiers fighting and dying so that others may live, Hill is more concerned about apartments built on the wrong side of a defunct armistice line. I question his values and his agenda.”</p> <p>Netanyahu’s declaration follows comments by the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, strongly rejecting the idea of a Palestinian state.</p> <p>“The answer is absolutely no and I’ll tell you why,” Hotovely said in an interview last month. “Israel knows today and the world should know now the reason the Oslo accords failed is because the Palestinians never wanted to have a state next to Israel. They wanted to have a state from the river to the sea.”</p> <p>Albanese is yet to be asked directly about Netanyahu’s comments. On Friday, he told ABC Radio: “Our position is very clear that we want a long term political solution here with Israelis and Palestinians able to live side by side in peace and security.”</p> <p>The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, has accused Labor of “inconsistencies” in its approach to Israel since Hamas’ 7 October attacks.</p> <p>“We’ve been concerned that the support for Israel’s inherent right to self-defence and to remove Hamas as a terrorist threat has been undermined by things such as the way Australia has voted at the United Nations in relation to ceasefire resolutions,” he said.</p>",

Eventually, confronted with the destruction of all her work by a shady tech billionaire, she realises that it is the very nature of intelligence that she should be fighting for.</p> <p>Launched in 2019 and produced by Ellie Keel and Paines Plough, the Women’s prize for playwriting is the only national prize to champion and support playwrights who identify as female or non-binary.</p> <p>“Sarah Grochala’s Intelligence is one of the plays I’ve been dreaming of finding since the idea for this prize first came to me,” Keel said. “It is powerful, original, expansive, ambitious – all the things that audiences hope for and deserve when they book to see a new play.</p> <p>“Sarah’s writing is witty and luminescent, vividly bringing to life her detailed research into the story of a fascinating and overlooked scientist and computing pioneer, Ada Lovelace, whose struggle to be recognised and fulfil her full potential sadly is, or has been, shared by so many women throughout history.”</p> <p>Grochala, a neurodiverse Anglo-Polish playwright, was awarded £12,000 in respect of an option for Ellie Keel Productions and Paines Plough to co-produce her play.</p> <p>The real Ada Lovelace, who lived from 1815 to 1852, was an English mathematician and writer, known primarily for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.</p>    <p>The daughter of the poet Lord Byron and the educational reformer Lady Byron, Lovelace has been called the first computer programmer.</p> <p>Previously, Grochala has written the Amnesty award-winning play S-27. She also writes audio episodes of Doctor Who, specialising in stories featuring robots and alien invasions in historical settings.</p> <p>This year’s competition received more than 1,000 entries, which were judged by a panel including the National Theatre director, Indhu Rubasingham; the playwrights April de Angelis and Chris Bush, the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner; the journalist Samira Ahmed; the actor Noma Dumezweni, the literary agent Mel Kenyon; the journalist and critic Anya Ryan, and the head of play development at the National Theatre, Nina Steiger.</p> <p>In past years, the prize has gone to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/01/first-womens-prize-for-playwriting-winners-ahlam-amy-trigg\">Reasons You Should(n’t) Love Me</a> by Amy Trigg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/01/first-womens-prize-for-playwriting-winners-ahlam-amy-trigg\">You Bury Me</a> by Ahlam, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/10/womens-prize-for-playwriting-karis-kelly-consumed\">Consumed</a> by Karis Kelly.</p> <p>Keel said in 2024 it felt “particularly poignant” to be awarding the prize to Intelligence “in the building next door to Ada’s London home for many years, 12 St James’s Square”.</p> <p>The joint artistic directors of Paines Plough, Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett, and Debo Adebayo, deputy artistic director, added: “We are thrilled to be celebrating the finalists and the winner for the third year of this incredible prize, which not only champions outstanding talent, but continues to actively diversify our national theatrical landscape.”</p> <p>They said Intelligence “blew us away with its boldness of storytelling and ambitious structure, which sees a central character cross centuries and discover what continues to inhibit female success”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My father, David Charlaff, who has died aged 71, was an osteopath committed to a “pay-what-you-can” business model – he accepted recompense in any form, from a token fee to artwork, theatre tickets or just a thank-you. As a result his practice in north London was a cross between a contemporary art gallery and a museum of anatomy, complete with flamingo skeletons and bottled sharks.</p> <p>David was born into a Jewish family in Cape Town, South Africa, where his father, Solly, was the owner of a printing company and his mother, Sybil (nee Slome), was a housewife. Despite apartheid-era antisemitism, David’s sporting prowess gave him access to such national institutions as the Junior Springboks rugby team.</p>    <p>After attending South African College school in Cape Town, as a young adult he ran a mobile disco with a Black friend and formed an activist stage company, Chicken theatre. He began his military service in the South African navy, but avoided completing it by dressing up as “Captain South Africa” and feigning insanity, thereby annoying the authorities.</p> <p>Amid rising political tensions in the 1970s, David and his then partner, Marsha Sanders, decided to emigrate to France. They settled there with their two children, Jess and Leyla, in a tiny mountain village in the Ardèche, where David worked as a goat farmer.</p> <p>After he and Marsha separated in 1976, David moved to Britain in 1977 and began training at the <a href=\"https://bcnogroup.ac.uk/\">European School of Osteopathy</a> in Kent. During this time he lived in a caravan and also worked as a builder.</p> <p>Once qualified as an osteopath in 1981, he established and ran the North End practice in Kentish Town, north London, then later worked alone at his own Northwood Road practice just off the Archway Road.</p> <p>A talented painter and sculptor, after retiring in 2017 due to ill health he was able to focus more closely on his art. During his final years he produced several drawings a day and enjoyed playing his harmonica to his youngest baby grandson. He also loved film, music and literature.</p> <p>In 1984, he married Lizza Aiken, an actor, with whom he had two children, Emil and me. The marriage ended in divorce in 2011.</p> <p>He is survived by his four children, five grandchildren and a sister, Suzanne.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The conflict in the Middle East has led to a surge in Islamist activity, with online terrorist propaganda rocketing and new individuals feared to have been radicalised, the head of counter-terrorism policing has said.</p> <p>Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Matt Jukes, who is head of the UK Counter Terrorism Policing network, said the events had led to a “dangerous climate” with indications of a rising threat, after Hamas’s atrocity against Israel on 7 October last year led to a sustained Israeli assault on Gaza with heavy civilian casualties still continuing.</p> <p>British counter-terrorism officials are concerned that outrage at Israel’s actions and at alleged western inaction is feeding grievances that can be exploited by Islamist propaganda, pushing people to go and stage their own attacks or support those who want to.</p> <p>Jukes said: “That puts us at a point in communities, on the street and online which would lead us to describe what has happened in the Middle East as a radicalisation moment.</p> <p>“These are the moments when a mixture of outrage, grievance and a set of enduring factors have got the potential to influence those susceptible of being pushed towards terrorism.”</p> <p>He said that referrals to Prevent, the official scheme to stop people becoming terrorists, were up 13% between 7 October and 31 December last year compared with the same period in 2022. Jukes said the increase “is directly related to the conflict in the Middle East”.</p> <p>After the attacks, the amount of terrorist propaganda online – a key way to incite attacks and support violent extremism – surged to 15 times the level it was at beforehand, before settling at a level seven times greater.</p> <p>The British counter-terrorism chief said that 700 cases referred to terrorist cyber investigators had a British link and had potentially broken terrorism or other laws.</p> <p>Jukes said: “That is extraordinary and demonstrates the volume and intensity of online rhetoric around the ongoing conflict.</p> <p>“We always see spikes after terrorist incidents but what we have seen since 7 October is higher and more sustained than ever before.</p> <p>“This is a conflict and these are tensions playing out online in a way which, in our experience, is unprecedented.”</p> <p>The counter-terrorism internet referral unit has had to be reinforced. Jukes said: “We’ve had to put an unprecedented number of people into that work because we are looking for a needle in a haystack, and when the haystack gets 15 times bigger that poses a real challenge.”</p> <p>Jukes said there had been a 25% increase in information flowing through police systems about terrorism and violent extremism, with useful calls coming in from the public: “I would describe the speed and the scale of the impact of those global events as extraordinary.”</p> <p>He said there had been 33 terrorism arrests in the UK since 7 October, with 19 for alleged offences at protests and 13 for alleged terrorism offences online. So far, seven people have been charged and an investigation continues into a killing to examine whether there was an extremist motive.</p> <p>The body that sets the UK terror threat level, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, has so far kept it at “substantial”. Jukes’s comments talked to fears that the likelihood of an attack has risen, with the most likely perpetrator being a lone actor carrying out an atrocity of low sophistication, such as a knife attack.</p> <p>Jukes said: “I have not seen the conditions collide in the way we have in the last months during my tenure.”</p> <p>But he added that the counter-terrorism command was skilled at foiling plots – 39 since 2017 – including making “goalline saves” where attacks were foiled at the last moment.</p> <p>The war crimes unit, consisting of 20 officers, has received 92 reports of alleged offences: 19 by Hamas and 73 by Israel. British detectives have assessed them and decided that one merits being sent to the international criminal court for further investigation.</p> <p>Jukes also said that espionage threats from foreign states – such as China, Russia and Iran – continue to grow, with organised criminals hired to stage attacks in some cases.</p> <p>“That challenge is greater now than it has been since the days of the cold war,” Jukes said.</p>",

The latest talent to emerge from the Génération Foot academy in Senegal’s capital, Dakar, that also produced Sadio Mané and Ismaïla Sarr, Camara was crowned this month as CAF’s young African player of the year after 12 months of dizzying progress.

Compared to Kevin De Bruyne and Toni Kroos, the midfielder is reportedly on the radar of several English clubs including Brighton and Chelsea, who are also expected to sign the Senegal under-17 midfielder Pape Daouda Diong.

It is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people. It’s also the only way to a secure settlement and a secure future.”</p> <p>Netanyahu’s public statement on Thursday is his most forceful rebuttal of US foreign policy at a time when the Biden administration has expended huge domestic political capital to support Israel militarily and in international forums.</p> <p>The White House responded by saying the US would continue working towards a two-state solution and that there could be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza when the war concluded.</p> <p>“There will be a post-conflict Gaza, no reoccupation of Gaza,” the White House national security adviser, John Kirby, told reporters onboard Air Force One after Netanyahu’s speech.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak has previously said the UK’s longstanding position is that a two-state solution is the right outcome.

            "body" : "<p>Every week we wrap up essential coverage of the war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, from news and features to analysis, opinion and more.</p> <h2>‘A reason to keep on living’</h2>    <p>“Everything broke in my head and soul. And my body. You are alive but you don’t feel alive.” With the Russians just a few kilometres away, Serhii Dovbysh was defending his home in Chernihiv <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/15/you-dont-feel-alive-ukraine-veterans-struggling-with-the-trauma-of-war\">when something inside him snapped</a>. Young soldiers under his command were dying in battle. Dovbysh, a major in Ukraine’s armed forces and a deputy commander, felt responsible.</p> <p>Russia’s full-scale invasion exacerbated his pre-existing mental health issues, he said, in a stressful period when there was scarcely time to eat or sleep. “I wanted to be brave and strong, to protect my country and town. But it was hard to cope. You knew the Russians might attack at any moment.”</p> <p>Now discharged from the army, Dovbysh, who was suffering from depression, works with war veterans who are struggling to deal with physical and psychological trauma. “For these guys it’s a long process. They need to find a reason to carry on living.” The picture is mixed, with some veterans coping better than others. Dovbysh <strong>told Luke Harding</strong> that he had found new purpose in helping ex-servicemen deal with the horrors of war.</p> <h2>‘Music is to me the light’</h2>    <p>For this piece <strong>Charlotte Higgins </strong>sets the scene at the National Philharmonic Hall in Warsaw, where the stakes are very high for everyone on stage. Violinist Joshua Bell and conductor Dalia Stasevska are on an intensely focused mission to get the opening bars of a concerto just right – and not just any concerto, but one by the virtually forgotten Ukrainian-born composer Thomas de Hartmann.</p> <p>The musicians of the International Symphony Orchestra Lviv (INSO-Lviv) are giving it its first commercial recording since the work’s premiere in 1943. They will then perform it in a concert of Ukrainian and Polish music in Warsaw.</p> <p>The young Ukrainian orchestra have spent nine hours queuing to cross the Polish border the previous day. They are coping with the heartbreaking fact that one of their horn-players, Maryan Hadzetskyy, is missing in action.</p> <p>The work – as well as other Ukrainian pieces the orchestra are preparing to perform in Warsaw – represents a discovery, and an assertion, of a Ukrainian classical musical heritage that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/16/dalia-stasevska-joshua-bell-interview-ukraine-kyiv-russia\">only now beginning to be fully realised</a>. Stasevska says: “There’s such a contrast between light and dark in Ukraine. Music is to me the light. It makes me believe in good – and in humanity.”</p> <h2>Ukraine shoots down two Russian warplanes</h2>    <p>Ukraine’s military shot down two of Russia’s command planes on Sunday, one of the most disastrous days for the Kremlin’s air power since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion, <strong>Luke Harding</strong> reported.</p> <p>Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s commander in chief, said his air force had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/15/ukraine-shoots-down-two-russian-aircraft-in-disastrous-day-for-kremlin\">destroyed an A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft and an Il-22 control centre plane</a>. Both were flying above the Sea of Azov on Sunday when they were hit at 9.10pm local time.</p> <p>The A-50, which detects air defences and coordinates targets for Russian jets, crashed instantly, killing its crew. The badly damaged Il-22 appeared to have made an emergency landing at an airfield in Anapa, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>.</p> <p>It was unclear how Ukraine managed to target and shoot down the planes. One theory is that a Patriot anti-aircraft missile battery – supplied by the US – was used. This, however, would have involved moving the system close to the frontline where it could be detected.</p> <h2>‘Spend Russia’s money now for Ukraine’s good’</h2>    <p>Britain has been ramping up pressure on western governments to use $350bn (£275bn) of frozen Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine, <strong>Larry Elliott</strong><em> </em>and<strong> Graeme Wearden </strong>reported.</p> <p>The rich G7 countries froze Russian central bank reserves after the invasion of February 2022, and there have been growing demands from Kyiv for the assets to be seized and spent on reconstruction. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s chief economist Beata Javorcik said without continuing flows of financial support from overseas there was a chance that Ukraine’s government would have to print money to pay its bills. “We don’t want a failed state,” she said.</p> <p>Speaking in Davos, where Ukraine has been high on the agenda this week at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Lord Cameron said: “When Putin launched this illegal invasion, the world changed, and we have to change with it and recognise we are in a more dangerous, uncertain and difficult world.</p> <p>“We should be prepared to do some innovative thinking about how we use these resources to help Ukraine.”</p> <p>Cameron said the moral argument was straightforward and strong. “At the end of the day, Russia is going to have to pay reparations for its illegal invasion, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/17/uk-urges-west-to-use-frozen-russian-assets-to-rebuild-ukraines-economy\">why not spend some of the money now, rather than wait till the war is over</a> and have all the legal wrangling about reparations”.</p>",
