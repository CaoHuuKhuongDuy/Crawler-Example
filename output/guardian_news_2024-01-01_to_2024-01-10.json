He will put himself first,” Christie said.</p> <p>He had earlier said that if Trump had been president when Islamist terrorists attacked the US on 9/11, “he would have [gone] to the bunker” instead of taking charge to protect the country.</p> <p>Christie said that “this is a fight for the soul of our party” and – echoing a campaign message Joe Biden, the Democratic president, has said many times – he added “and the soul of our country.”</p> <p>He said that if Trump ultimately becomes the Republican nominee, the moment that was going to happen could be traced back to the GOP debate in Milwaukee last August when all the other candidates present – Trump was absent – except Christie himself raised their hands when asked if they would still nominate someone if they had a criminal conviction.</p> <p>If Trump became president again, the US “will remain angry … remain divided”, Christie said.</p> <p>Christie’s exit removes from the race the only candidate willing to base his campaign on attacking Donald Trump, the former president who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/28/donald-trump-investigations-criminal-charges-tracker\">faces 91 criminal charges</a> arising from his conduct since entering politics, including his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, as well as provoking multiple civil cases and moves to remove him from the ballot in states including Colorado and Maine.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/chris-christie-anti-trump-candidate\">longtime Trump ally</a> and adviser since endorsing him in 2016, Christie stayed loyal even after Trump nearly killed him with Covid-19, only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/06/chris-christie-announces-2024-presidential-run\">turn</a> after Trump incited the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021.</p> <p>In a recent campaign ad, Christie <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/04/christie-trump-2024-00133784\">said</a>: “Eight years ago when I decided to endorse Donald Trump for president, I did it because he was winning, and I did it because I thought I could make him a better candidate and a better president. Well, I was wrong, I made a mistake.”</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Christie focused on attacking Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/07/the-republican-debate-was-another-grim-exercise-in-futility-and-attention-seeking\">from the debate stage</a> and on campaigning in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/21/ron-desantis-fifth-new-hampshire-trump-ramaswamy-haley-christie\">New Hampshire</a>.</p> <p>Long seen as suspect by hardline Republican voters, largely over his past as governor of an east coast, predominantly Democratic state, he could not make much of an impact.</p> <p>Christie’s failed presidential campaign in 2016 and scandal-tainted record in office – in 2013, he became embroiled in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/04/bridgegate-trial-chris-christie-new-jersey-what-we-learned\">Bridgegate scandal</a> over political payback – also worked against him.</p> <p>In further details of the apparent hot-mic incident, which was widely reported on social media and in <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/01/10/chris-christie-hot-mic-nikki-haley\">US news outlets</a>, Christie was heard saying to an unknown individual: “She’s going to get smoked, and you and I both know it … She’s not up to this.”</p> <p>He was assumed to be referring to Haley as he then mentioned fundraising numbers that resemble Haley’s. She is the former governor of South Carolina and formerly the Trump-appointed US ambassador to the United Nations.</p> <p>Christie could then be heard saying “DeSantis called me, petrified” and an unknown person responding that DeSantis is “probably getting out after Iowa”.</p> <p>Christie had not, immediately after announcing his campaign suspension, commented on the hot-mic incident.</p>",

The Jürgen Klopp way was to wait until the 56th minute and throw on Cody Gakpo and Darwin Núñez to fill the void left by Mohamed Salah.</p> <p>It worked. A quarter of an hour later Liverpool had transformed a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 victory, the Gakpo‑Núñez combo crafting the winner. Yet until their introduction this semi-final first leg against Fulham was the oddest of tales.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/10/liverpool-fulham-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report\">Gakpo caps Liverpool fightback to gain Carabao Cup first-leg edge over Fulham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Becalmed at Anfield: it is supposed to be the fate of visitors, not of Liverpool. Especially not a Klopp vintage who are Premier League leaders, who began this match unbeaten in 14 games at their cathedral, 12 of these wins, with only Manchester United and Arsenal managing to avoid defeat here.</p> <p>This, though, was the story until the 68th minute when Curtis Jones hit one in off Tosin Adarabioyo’s back and then Gakpo slotted home a cool flicked finish the missing Salah might have fashioned, the pinpoint delivery coming from Núñez.</p> <p>Until their advent, this second outing since the loss of Salah on Africa Cup of Nations duty and a first following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/09/liverpool-injury-crisis-intensifies-after-trent-alexander-arnold-ruled-out-for-weeks-football\" title=\"\">Trent Alexander‑Arnold’s knee problem</a> had featured two other A-listers, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté, being too feeble, too often, in a rearguard also including a makeshift left-back – Joe Gomez – and Conor Bradley, a 20-year-old yet to play in the Premier League.</p> <p>In the absence of Salah and Alexander-Arnold, Klopp did not need to see his captain culpable for Fulham’s opener, yet it was Van Dijk’s weak header that allowed Willian to dance in and score. Then moments later, a handoff on Andreas Pereira drew a yellow card. Rattled? A touch, as were Liverpool, whose shakiness will alert their main title rivals, Manchester City.</p> <p>Van Dijk’s Liverpool CV shows a sweep of all domestic honours plus the Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup. Willian, previously at Arsenal and Chelsea, has also claimed every trophy available in the English game plus the Europa League: a more modest record than the Dutchman’s but, at 35, his strike and scampering presence along the left teemed with the vigour of a man a decade younger.</p>    <p>Klopp’s solution to the Salah problem had been, initially, Harvey Elliott, who was asked to probe in the “Mo-zone” on the right of a frontline that had Diogo Jota marauding centrally and Luis Díaz on the left. But this trident’s toothlessness was summed up by Liverpool’s best efforts coming from long range from a defender, Gomez, and a midfielder, Ryan Gravenberch. Later, when Jota was in on Bernd Leno’s goal he over elaborated and Adarabioyo hacked clear.</p> <p>Fulham had been 3-2 up until the 86th minute of the Premier League meeting at this stadium in December before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/03/liverpool-fulham-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Waturu Endo and Alexander-Arnold goals</a> undid them. Now, they inched towards a priceless advantage ahead of the second leg in a fortnight.</p> <p>Klopp, though, did what all the best managers do: act decisively, by hooking Gravenberch and Elliott for Gakpo and Núñez. Yet before they sealed the win the Van Dijk‑Konaté axis was again fooled by Willian, the Brazilian forward’s ball slicing open Liverpool and putting Bobby De Cordova-Reid in for a chance that had Marco Silva stamping in frustration when he missed.</p> <p>The Fulham manager had declared it was great fans could “dream” of a trip to Wembley. This defeat does not end the fantasy as his side saw enough holes in their hosts’ defence to encourage them in a clash that pitted the land’s second-highest major domestic cup winners in Liverpool (17) against a west London side yet to win a major honour.</p> <p>The club by the River Thames have to rewind 49 years for their only final on these shores when an XI captained by Alan Mullery and containing Bobby Moore went down 2-0 against West Ham in the 1975 FA Cup final. So at Craven Cottage in 14 days’ time, the hope will be that this iteration can overturn the 2-1 deficit and bridge the gap to that Wembley day, and the 14 years since the sole other occasion Fulham were 90 minutes from glory.</p> <p>That was the 2010 Europa League final when Roy Hodgson’s men took the Atlético Madrid of Sergio Agüero, David de Gea and Diego Forlán into extra time at Hamburg’s Volksparkstadion before Forlán’s second goal – after Simon Davies had equalised on 37 minutes – broke their hearts.</p> <p>That year Fulham’s scalps in the knockout rounds were Shakhtar Donetsk, Juventus, Wolfsburg and Hamburg. In this list beating Juve 4-1 at Craven Cottage, having lost 3-1 at the Stadio Delle Alpi, with Clint Dempsey’s memorable 82nd-minute clincher is the headline result. Knocking Klopp’s side out in the semi-final of England’s second-biggest cup would rank alongside the feat. Or even trump it.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Episodes II and III will have to be very, very special if the Madrid Trilogy is going to end as well as it started. Not content with facing each other three times in three competitions and three weeks, Atlético and Real decided to play half an hour more just for the fun of it, scoring three goals each to take a sixth successive derby knockout tie into extra time. There, a wild, wonderful game was finally finished off when Jan Oblak, the Atlético goalkeeper, up for one last throw of the dice trailing 4-3, instead found himself desperately chasing as Brahim Díaz broke clear and bent the ball into an empty net in the 121st minute to send his teammates streaming on to the pitch and into the final of the Spanish Super Cup.</p> <p>It was a fitting finale for a frantic occasion: a game with lots of entertainment and eight goals, two of which were really superb and two of which were really very silly. Most were not exactly scored by the usual suspects. Antoine Griezmann got the best to overtake Luis Aragonés as Atlético’s all-time top scorer, sure, but not many would have predicted strikes for Mario Hermoso, Toni Rüdiger, Ferland Mendy and Dani Carvajal, defenders all. Or own goals from Kepa Arrizabalaga and Stefan Savic, the latter finally handing Real an extra-time lead that would see them through. Just.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/06/girona-atletico-madrid-la-liga\">Girona’s wild and wonderful win over Atlético shows title tilt is no fluke | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately the first meeting between these two sides, who meet each other in the Copa del Rey next week and the league at the start of February, had 30 shots and went from 1-0 to Atlético to 2-1 to Real, from 3-2 Atlético to 5-3 Real. It wasn’t definitively over until the very end, when Díaz, on as a subtitute, was standing there with his top off and everyone was trying to work out what had happened. The answer was a bit of everything, except defending.</p> <p>By the end everyone was exhausted but for a lot of the game the technique had been exceptional, if facilitated by the feel of the two sides wanting to enjoy this more than is likely to be the case with the next two back in Spain.</p> <p>It had been on show from the very start, and particularly in the move that led to the opening goal: built deep in one half and finished in the other, it went from Koke to the exceptional Rodrigo de Paul to Griezmann and then Samuel Lino, whose curler was pushed wide by Kepa. From the corner taken by Griezmann, Hermoso stood all alone and headed Atlético into the lead. When Real then boxed Atlético in soon after, they did it again, this time going from their own left corner to Real’s left-hand post, where Marcos Llorente’s ball found Álvaro Morata and his shot hit the side-netting.</p> <p>Real were struggling to get a grip of those early phases, yet Atlético know all about their refusal to fold and they soon led. Jude Bellingham sent a deflected shot wide and, from the corner, there was Rüdiger to head in a goal that was a virtual copy of <em>that</em> moment from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league\">the European Cup final in Lisbon</a>, a decade ago now but ever present. The taker was even the same man: Luka Modric.</p> <p>It was the second game in a row that Rüdiger had scored and the third consecutive Real goal to come from a header at a corner, but that run didn’t last long. If that sounds routine, this certainly wasn’t: a smartly worked move finished with a fine flick of Mendy’s ankle to put his side into the lead. “That’s how Madrid win,” chanted the crowd in Riyadh, where Real are very much the home team, 5,000km away. It is not, though, what you most expect from the French full-back.</p>    <p>It was a lovely goal, worthy of what was unfolding – what the match lacked in tension it made up for in technique – and what followed was even better. Griezmann sent Aurélien Tchouaméni, Rüdiger and especially Modric the wrong way with an extraordinary backheeled turn that magically made a space appear that hadn’t been there a second before. Stepping into it, he fired right-footed past Kepa from the edge of the area, recovering the ball from the net and giving it to Diego Simeone for safe keeping. This, after all, was the ball with which he had just scored his 164th goal for Atlético – more, now, than anyone else ever – and levelled the semi-final.</p> <p>Another moment’s fantasy came soon after when, with a shift of weight as quick and feet as fast as the Frenchman’s had been, Rodrygo left José María Giménez on the floor. Oblak, too, was falling the other way but somehow he saved with his legs, gratefully grabbing at the ball as it looked like it might spin over the line. It was the 14th shot of a hugely enjoyable first half, nine of them on target, and as the second began Lino hit another fractionally beyond the post. Then, released by a quickly taken Vinícius free-kick, Carvajal probably should have scored at the other end only for Oblak to block his close-range volley.</p> <p>By then, the volume had risen: Toni Kroos, who had said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/mohammed-bin-salman-says-he-will-continue-doing-sport-washing-for-saudi-arabia\">Saudi Arabia’s human rights record</a> was a reason he would never move to the country, was booed every time he got the ball.</p> <p>The drama would rise, too, even if the game had slowed. Atlético took the lead again 12 minutes from the end with a goal that was bizarre and comic. Kepa jumped over Morata to try to punch a cross but all he managed to do was deflect it down on to Rüdiger’s leg and back into his net. The goalkeeper complained that he was fouled but it was the reaction of an embarrassed man clutching at straws – and he didn’t manage to hold those, either.</p> <p>He was, though, rescued. With six minutes left, Vinícius zoomed up the left and raced into the area. Oblak saved his first shot, Savic blocked Bellingham’s follow-up, Hermoso cleared Bellingham’s second follow-up off the line but, steaming in, Carvajal slammed the ball in to make it 3-3. Brahim almost got the winner 91 minutes in, going past Hermoso with a superb stepover, but his shot went wide, sending another derby into extra time, where a dummy from Ángel Correa produced a similar moment for Atlético.</p> <p>Atlético looked exhausted now and could only try, and fail, to hang on. The way it happened was cruel and a little daft, Savic’s interception bouncing over his own goalkeeper and into the net with four minutes to go and penalties looming. Griezmann then bent just past the post. As the final minute went up and Atlético chased, so did Oblak. Forced to turn back and pursue, he watched as Brahim Díaz got away and so did their last chance.</p>",

An American vessel had been targeted because it was providing support to the Israelis, the group added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"053814f2-998a-4713-af9e-4533bf5232cc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rB9KL6Pom5I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The British defence secretary also directly accused Iran of helping the Houthis. “I am in no doubt whatsoever that the Iranians are heavily behind what they’re [the Houthis] are doing, including ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] eyes and ears,” he said.</p> \n<p>Previous intelligence leaks from the US have suggested an Iranian paramilitary surveillance vessel is providing intelligence about shipping movements in the southern Red Sea to the Houthis.</p> \n<p>There have been 26 attacks since mid-October, deterring a large number of shipping companies from using the Red Sea naval route and pushing up prices.</p> \n<p>Shapps said HMS Diamond had “repelled the largest attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the Red Sea to date”. He added that the ship, described by the Royal Navy as “a jewel in the naval crown”, had destroyed multiple attack drones with guns and Sea Viper missiles.</p> \n<p>Each Sea Viper/Aster missile costs about £1m to £2m. Although the number of missiles fired is not yet clear, the one-way attack drones likely to have been used by the Houthis will have cost far less, with $20,000 frequently cited as the price for an Iranian Shaheed 136 drone and its variants.</p> \n<p>A UN security council resolution condemning the Houthi actions, but not authorising the use of force, was due to be passed in New York on Wednesday. It is unclear whether any other country, particularly France, would be willing to join what could be joint US-UK reprisals against the Houthis.</p> \n<p>The Houthis formally rejected the western demand in a letter to the UN, and followed this up with a military assault that reduced the options available to Centcom.</p> \n<p>Plans to designate the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organisation, a designation lifted by the US president, Joe Biden, at the start of his term in office, have fallen away as an alternative response.</p> \n<p>The Houthi military spokesperson said: “We carried out an operation with a large number of ballistic and naval missiles and drones targeting an American ship that was providing support [to Israel]. The operation came as a preliminary response to the treacherous attack on our naval forces by the American enemy.”</p> \n<p>Western officials are discussing which countries might be prepared to be part of military action against Yemen, with most attention focused one whether French ships would join an attack on coastal radars.</p> \n<p>One issue under discussion is whether the US would mount a single punitive attack or a longer-term campaign to identify the mobile sites from which Houthis are firing missiles.</p> \n<p>Whitehall estimates based on shipping industry forecasts suggest the global impact of extended disruption to shipping could lead to a 0.2-0.5% rise in inflation, with the impact most severe on the finances of Egypt due to the loss of commercial shipping through the Suez canal.</p> \n<p>Privately, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two countries that have battled with the Houthis in the nine-year Yemen civil war, are said to be sympathetic to military action against the Houthis but are wary of being seen to support US-led military action against a group that has won extensive popular support for its acts of solidarity with Gaza.</p> \n<p>The UK has been busy diplomatically with Oman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/01/iran-rejects-us-and-uk-calls-to-end-support-for-houthi-red-sea-attacks\">and Iran</a>, the two countries with direct influence over the Houthis, to press home the message that Houthi activity is unacceptable and, if it continues, jeopardises the Yemen peace plan being taken forward.</p> \n<p>It is argued the group’s actions undermine the chances that the Houthis will ever be seen as a responsible actor on the world stage capable of forming part of a government in Yemen with the UN-recognised government in the south.</p> \n<p>The warnings over the suspension of the peace process, which follow talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia last year, are probably regarded as the best leverage the west has over the Houthis apart from military action and sanctions.</p> \n<p>The first six-month stage of the peace plan would include the payment of outstanding salaries to tens of thousands of public sector staff based on 2014 payrolls and funded by Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>A military disruption would also eat into the revenues the Houthis receive in the form of customs and taxes worth more than $1bn a year imposed on ships entering the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah.</p>",

Fulham, third from bottom of the then Division Two, going three matches, two with extra time, against Liverpool. 330 minutes which should have ended in Fulham’s favour: I can still see in my mind’s eye Ray Houghton, then of Fulham, not yet of Liverpool, jinking in from the left past two players, arriving in the middle of the box and ……… carrying on jinking to the right instead of shooting.

Chris Low first reported the news.</p>&mdash; Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BruceFeldmanCFB/status/1745207149960335652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Before that, he led Louisiana State to a national championship in 2003, following previous head coaching stints at Michigan State University and the University of Toledo.</p> <p>Saban is the only coach to win seven national titles in the AP poll era of college football (since 1936): six with Alabama and one with LSU. The Crimson Tide won at least 10 games in 16 consecutive seasons on his watch, the longest streak in the poll era.</p> <p>The five-time Southeastern Conference coach of the year will retire with a 292-71-1 record at the college level, not including five wins <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4250596\">vacated by the NCAA in 2009</a> over rules violations stemming from improper benefits. The 292 wins rank sixth all-time in the Football Bowl Subdivision, college football’s top flight, and 12th overall regardless of division.</p>    <p>Famed for his sideline scowl and fiery demeanor – and for winning – Saban made a two-year foray into the NFL with the Dolphins before returning to college football to revive one of America’s most storied programs, which hadn’t won a national title in 15 years. Saban enjoyed successful runs at Toledo, Michigan State and LSU, but Alabama is where he cemented his status as one of the sport’s greatest coaches.</p> <p>His latest team dealt with plenty of adversity early on, including a loss to Texas, but rebounded with the emergence of quarterback Jalen Milroe to upset then-No 1 Georgia in the SEC championship game.</p> <p>Saban didn’t sound like a coach looking to give up the job any time soon after the game. But it wasn’t a bad way to go, even without the title.</p> <p>“This is one of the most amazing seasons in Alabama football history in terms of where this team came from, what they were able to accomplish and what they were able to do, winning the SEC championship, and really, really proud of this group,” he said.</p> <p>“I just wish that I could have done more as a coach to help them be successful and help them finish, and all we can do now is learn from the lessons that sometimes failings bring to us.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Keir Starmer has said he is “up for the fight” of defending the “nanny state” as he announced plans to improve child health under a Labour government, including supervised toothbrushing in schools.</p> <p>The Labour leader said that children were “probably the biggest casualty” of the Tories’ sticking-plaster approach to politics over the past 14 years, adding that, if the government were a parent, they could be charged with neglect.</p> <p>“I know that we need to take on this question of the nanny state,” he told reporters ahead of a visit to a children’s hospital. “The moment you do anything on child health, people say ‘you’re going down the road of the nanny state.’ We want to have that fight.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/10/britain-suffered-terribly-tories-children-neglect\">Writing for the Guardian</a>, Starmer added: “More children are becoming unhealthy, with two in every five leaving primary school overweight. But most damning of all, the number one reason for young children being admitted to hospital is to extract rotten teeth – because it is so difficult to get NHS dental treatment before tooth decay sets in.</p> <p>“And incredibly, after 14 years of the Tories, the rise in life expectancy has stalled.”</p> <p>The height of the average British five-year-old girl has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/21/children-raised-under-uk-austerity-shorter-than-european-peers-study\">fallen by 27 places</a> in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) rankings over the past three decades, and boys by 33 places, while the UK is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/08-11-2022-childhood-obesity-in-european-region-remains-high--new-who-report-presents-latest-country-data\">more obese children</a> than France, Germany, Poland and Slovenia. Added to this, about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/16/buckling-nhs-fails-to-treat-250000-children-with-mental-health-problems\">250,000 British children</a> are now on mental-health waiting lists.</p> <p>Labour’s action plan includes a 9pm watershed for junk-food ads, banning vape adverts aimed at children, a free breakfast club in every primary school, better access to mental-health support, cutting waiting times for hospital care for children, and guaranteeing more dental appointments.</p> <p>Starmer said that his plans, which would be introduced in the first term of a Labour government, were just the “first steps” needed to improve the health of British children. “This is something we acknowledge is going to take time, and we’re not pretending that everything can be turned around in weeks or months.”</p> <p>The Labour leader, who will make fortnightly visits around the country to set out the detail of his five missions for government, said supervised tooth-brushing for three- to five-year-olds was needed because the biggest cause of hospital admissions up to the age of 10 is decayed teeth.</p> <p>“I don’t think you can simply say, ‘Well, that’s none of our business.’ It is our business because it’s the health of the child. But also, once you’ve got a child admitted to hospital, it’s costing the taxpayer a fortune,” he added.</p> <p>“I’m not saying it’s the state and not parents, it’s got to be both, but just to sort of walk on the other side and say, ‘It’s not our responsibility, who cares if six- to 10-year-olds are going into hospital with tooth decay?’ I’m up for that fight.”</p> <p>He said that critics of state intervention had to explain how they wanted to cut taxes because health bills “will never come down” if children are in hospital with tooth problems.</p> <p>Under Labour’s plans, which Starmer said were fully costed, there would be mental-health support provided in every school, community mental-health hubs aimed at under-25s and 8,500 new mental-health professionals recruited.</p> <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the plans, but added: “All of this needs to be properly resourced – with sufficient staffing and funding to ensure that these pledges become reality, and a sensible delineation of expectations on schools, healthcare and parents.”</p> <p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Labour’s focus on and proposals for greater mental-health support are welcome, but it must be recognised that significant investment will be required to rebuild the health and support services that have been so eroded over the last decade.”</p> <p>The British Dental Association chairman, Eddie Crouch, said: “Supervised brushing is a tried and tested policy, that the government’s own modelling shows pays for itself. It’s a scandal that decay remains the number one reason for hospital admissions among young children. Prevention isn’t just better than cure, it’s cheaper, too.”</p> <p>• In the UK, the charity <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a> is available on 0300 123 3393 and <a href=\"https://www.childline.org.uk/\">Childline</a> on 0800 1111.

I think there was a small number within a 20-year window, that’s all I know,” he said.</p> <p>“I don’t even now – I think the CPS are helping with inquiries – how many of those may or may not have involved Horizon.”</p> <p>While the Post Office itself prosecuted hundreds of post office operators based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/07/what-is-the-post-office-horizon-it-scandal-all-about\">the faulty Horizon IT system</a>, it has emerged from official reviews that 10 cases taken by the CPS resulted in convictions. Three occurred while Starmer was DPP.</p> <p>“They didn’t go to his desk,” a Labour spokesperson said.</p> <p>Separately, pressure continue to mount on Vennells, 64, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/former-post-office-boss-paula-vennells-to-return-cbe-amid-horizon-scandal\">a day after she announced she would hand back the CBE awarded to her</a> when she headed the Post Office, with Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson signalling he took a dim view of those holding on to bonuses.</p> <p>“In general terms it would be wrong for businesses or individuals to profit from this miscarriage of justice,” he said.</p> <p>Kevin Hollinrake, minister for postal services, also conceded in parliament that many would see Vennells serving as a Cabinet Office director during 2019 to 2020 as a “mistake”.</p> <p>His comments followed a question from Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper, who said: “Paula Vennells has quite rightly handed back her CBE, but many subpostmasters are asking why she was given it in the first place, and also why she was given a role as director of the Cabinet Office?”</p> <p>Hollinrake responded: “It clearly was prior to my time in government, but she raises some interesting points, I don’t know the answer to her question. I think with hindsight many people would see that as a mistake, but very happy to take that away.”</p> <p>After Hollinrake’s comments, the Lib Dems also called on the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, to “come clean” over his failure to sack Vennells. Dowden was Cabinet Office minister in 2019 when a high court judgment was handed down in which a group of 555 post office operators won a group action brought against the Post Office.</p> <p>The high court ruled that Horizon contained a number of “bugs, errors and defects”, and there was a “material risk” that shortfalls in post office branch accounts were caused by the system.</p> <p>A Conservative former minister also claimed that while he was in government, Vennells refused to meet him without her lawyer present.</p> <p>George Freeman, a former business minister, told MPs: “I was never minister for the Post Office, but I remember as a minister in the department being asked to cover for an absent minister, and when refusing to just read out the speech but ask for a proper day of briefings from officials, and asked to meet Paula Vennells, I was told she would refuse to meet me without her lawyer.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The social media tycoon Mark Zuckerberg’s latest business venture raising “world-class” beef cattle on his sprawling luxury Hawaiian hideaway has been derided as out of touch and environmentally irresponsible.</p> <p>The Meta billionaire posted a picture of himself on Wednesday eating a steak – medium rare, no sides – from his Ko’olau ranch, a 1,400-acre compound on Kauai, Hawaii’s oldest island.</p> <p>“Started raising cattle at [the] Ko’olau ranch on Kauai, and my goal is to create some of the highest quality beef in the world,” <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/zuck/?hl=en\">wrote</a> Zuckerberg on Instagram.</p> <p>Only the best, then, for the world’s sixth richest man, who is farming wagyu and Angus cattle, which yield some of the world’s most expensive meat.</p> <p>“Each cow eats 5,000-10,000lbs of food each year, so that’s a lot of acres of macadamia trees. My daughters help plant the mac trees and take care of our different animals. We’re still early in the journey and it’s fun improving on it every season. Of all my projects, this is the most delicious,” added Zuckerberg, whose wealth currently stands at $129bn, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>The cattle will be raised on macadamia nuts and beer produced within the $100m compound – which will also house an underground bunker and energy projects, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-inside-hawaii-compound/\">according to a recent investigation by Wired</a>.</p> <p>“Raising cattle on water-intensive macadamia nuts and beer is just a billionaire’s strange sideshow. We need real agriculture reform to address the inequities in our food system and the reality of a warming climate,” said Mitch Jones, policy director at Food &amp; Water Watch, a national legal and policy nonprofit.</p> <p>“We need to promote the viability of small and medium-sized farms that work to feed everyone, not just wealthy celebrities.”</p> <p>Beef is a major contributor to deforestation, water pollution and global heating. Climate scientists warn that consumption must fall, especially in the developed world, in order to limit the most harmful effects of the climate crisis.</p> <p>A fully grown cow can release up to 500 litres of methane per day, which <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9559257/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Intergovernmental%20Panel,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20%5B36%5D\">accounts for</a> about 3.7 % of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization.</p> <p>Methane – the greenhouse gas cattle emit in their belches – is highly potent, and over the course of 20 years causes <a href=\"https://unece.org/challenge#:~:text=Methane%20is%20a%20powerful%20greenhouses,are%20due%20to%20human%20activities\">about 85 times</a> more warming than CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>On X, the social media platform owned by rival Elon Musk, the response to Zuckerberg’s new career as a beef farmer was largely mocking.</p> <p>“Proud of you, man. You really fulfilled that dream of putting food in your mouth in the manner that causes the most climate change possible for a human being,” said <a href=\"https://x.com/a_greenberg/status/1745152415706321402?s=20\">Andrew Greenberg, an author and journalist.</a></p> <p>Shalin Gala from the animal rights group Peta <a href=\"https://x.com/ShalinGala/status/1745143991090168035?s=20\">condemned</a> Zuckerberg for being stuck in the “dark ages”. Another critic, coloradotravis, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coloradotravis/status/1744914532131107324\">tweeted</a>: “The absolute stones it must take post ‘I’m growing a macadamia orchard to feed my artisan wagyu’ during an era of rising populism.”</p>",

Klopp’s team came from 3-2 down in the 87th minute to lead 4-3 by the 88th last time out. Their latest comeback was not quite so dramatic but another two‑goal blitz, from Curtis Jones and Cody Gakpo, transformed the complexion in Liverpool’s favour once again.</p> <p>Gakpo’s winner was the 15th goal scored by a Liverpool substitute this season. Darwin Núñez also had a major impact off the bench and would have put the semi-final beyond Fulham but for three fine saves from Bernd Leno in the closing stages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/10/klopp-finally-fills-the-salah-void-but-fulham-create-enough-to-spark-hope\">Klopp finally fills the Salah void but Fulham create enough to spark hope | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“To turn a game around you need quality, you need belief and beyond that you need mentality,” the Liverpool manager said. “The tie is not over yet unfortunately. I didn’t expect a result tonight where we could say: ‘Yes, we can book the hotels for Wembley.’ Marco will not be overly happy tonight but they caused us problems. We will cause them problems and hopefully we’ll be better from the start.”</p> <p>Fulham had lost all five previous League Cup meetings with Liverpool but made their first appearance in the semi-finals in confident form and took the lead from their first meaningful attack. It came from a rare error by Virgil van Dijk, who missed the FA Cup third-round <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/07/arsenal-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">win at Arsenal on Sunday</a> because of illness and was left feeling pig-sick on his return.</p> <p>The visitors were under constant pressure at the start as Liverpool dominated possession. Jones and Diogo Jota both threatened Leno’s goal. With Conor Bradley settling in comfortably at right‑back in place of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/09/liverpool-injury-crisis-intensifies-after-trent-alexander-arnold-ruled-out-for-weeks-football\" title=\"\">the injured Trent Alexander‑Arnold</a>, even roaming freely in his hybrid midfield role at times, Fulham appeared in for a long and testing night. So much for appearances.</p> <p>Liverpool’s control and composure evaporated when Fulham edged in front. The breakthrough started with a Joe Gomez throw-in that was headed back towards the Liverpool penalty area. Van Dijk, attempting to clear under pressure from Raúl Jiménez, miscued a weak header into the path of Andreas Pereira who advanced into the box and pulled the ball back for Willian. The 35-year-old Brazilian stumbled over a prostrate Bradley but was able to keep his balance long enough to drill a powerful shot inside Caoimhín Kelleher’s near post.</p>    <p>The Liverpool captain was booked moments later for catching Pereira in the face with an elbow as the pair contested a loose ball. There was no VAR in operation to slow down the incident and make it look far worse. The technology has been removed from all the semi-finals due to the involvement of a Championship club, Middlesbrough. A small mercy.</p> <p>Liverpool’s first-half performance deteriorated from the moment Willian scored. Unforced errors began to litter their display and possession was lost cheaply. Not for the first time, Klopp’s half-time team talk instigated a vast improvement. The hosts attacked with far greater intensity and purpose in the second half. Fulham, having been increasingly comfortable as the first half wore on, found themselves besieged, albeit with several opportunities to hurt Liverpool on the break.</p> <p>Bobby De Cordova-Reid was unable to capitalise on three chances that fell his way, being denied by a fine Gomez tackle, just failing to connect with a Willian through ball, and shooting at Kelleher when Pereira was better placed inside.</p> <p>“That was one of the key moments,” Silva said of De Cordova‑Reid failing to find Pereira. “We reacted well after the first 10 minutes of the second half and we were dangerous on the counterattack. Bobby didn’t see Pereira, because he would have been one‑on‑one with the goalkeeper. Unfortunately Liverpool have the capacity to punish you in many ways. It is going to be tough because Liverpool are leading but we are going to fight to get what we want at Craven Cottage.”</p> <p>Fulham were punished twice in quick succession. Liverpool levelled with a slice of good fortune when Jota won two strong challenges before finding Núñez. The striker set up Jones for a 20-yard effort that struck Tosin Adarabioyo as the defender turned his back and looped over the stranded Leno. Jota and Núñez were heavily involved in Liverpool’s second, too. The former sent the latter racing down the left and, from Núñez’s low cross, Gakpo swept home a superb finish at the near post. All to play for.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>I’ll be honest with you. My hopes weren’t high for new six-part drama After the Flood. ITV drama is a hit-and-miss affair – increasingly the former, but not yet often enough that you can approach an evening’s viewing with unassailable confidence in the investment you are about to make – and the publicity made this one sound like a standard police procedural, with added water.</p> <p>My hopes do not noticeably rise in the opening scenes, which does indeed contain a lot of added water as a river bursts its banks and floods the nearby town. The local police leap into action. “Let’s do all we can to help,” says their sergeant (Nicholas Gleaves), which makes you fear for the script and the townspeople’s chances of survival. Soon PCs Joanna Marshall (Sophie Rundle) and Deepa Das (Tripti Tripuraneni) find themselves losing the slightly bathetic struggle to save an infant from being carried away by the waters (you shouldn’t try these things without a Hollywood budget; the waters are never quite dramatic enough, the baby always too rubbery). They are metaphorically saved, and the baby, literally, when a passing stranger dives in and rescues it before being carried away himself. As the days wear on, he is presumed by Jo to have drowned.</p> <p>Then … well, then the dramatic set piece – ending with the revelation that Jo is pregnant (this is her last day on active duty) – is over and After the Flood gets really good. It settles into the aftermath of the disaster, introduces us to folk, conjures a real town and real relationships swiftly and convincingly. You understand within a few minutes why the show has attracted the likes of Lorraine Ashbourne (absolutely wonderful as always, this time as Jo’s widowed mother, Molly), Philip Glenister (so far just as a helpful local man with a tractor but with no doubt more to do) and Rundle to its cast. Peripheral characters – such as the old couple who have known Jo for years and decline her offer of help with a detailed account of their flood preparations and the state of their bowels – are as credible as any others. It is a perfectly rendered community and you barely need the imminent murder mystery to keep you watching.</p> <p>But murder mystery there is (on top of, and possibly tied to, the maybe-drowned baby-saviour), sparked by the discovery of a man’s body in a lift in an underground car park. At first he is presumed to have been caught by the rising water, until the postmortem reveals that he was dead for at least three days before that. Jo, the first officer on the scene, becomes increasingly interested in the case, and remains so despite a nice, unexpected twist which hampers her involvement. Then we end on a pleasing cliffhanger which should seal the deal on viewers coming back for more next Wednesday. This is a series rightly confident enough to have gone for old-school weekly releases. January is the perfect time for deferred gratification, after all.</p> <p>The broader backdrop is the climate crisis. After the Flood is about how big global changes play out in microcosmic terms. The local councillor’s flummery when confronted (mostly by Molly – do not mess with a community linchpin who is distracting herself from grief) about the lack of sandbags, sirens and other resources that might have mitigated the dangers is emblematic of international inertia in the face of looming planetary catastrophe. The tragic failure of the old couple’s preparations shows the limits of what we as individuals – or even individual countries – can do. This message would be depressing enough to cause viewers to desert the show in droves, were it not folded into a good story playing out among even better characters, and made extra palatable by the rare and delightful sense that you are unexpectedly being served something much, much better than it needs to be.</p> <p>• After the Flood is on ITV1 and ITVX.</p>",

My own dissident reaction to the 2004 original was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jun/18/3\">mean review</a> based on feeling it was inferior to Clueless, Election and 10 Things I Hate About You, and that it had its cake and ate it on the prettiness-fascism issue.</p> <p>But I could have paid more attention to the showstopping individually funny lines; screenwriter Tina Fey after all went on to create an authentic masterpiece with TV’s 30 Rock, in which she could more successfully represent in her own person the eternal Mean Girls themes of reconciling success with kindness. Moreover the Broadway Mean Girls was a big improvement on the film because the musical genre makes everything more amusingly histrionic – the “diva” theme made explicit – and this movie version succeeds in the same way, although like the subsequent movie iteration it sags in the over-extended third act.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvO0kkvugBc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cvO0kkvugBc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Angourie Rice takes the role first played by Lindsay Lohan: she is sweet, unworldly teen Cady, once homeschooled by her academic mom in Kenya, and now relocated to the United States and having to fit in at high school where everyone is suspicious of this gawky (but beautiful) nerd. Fey reprises her role as maths teacher Ms Norbury, Jon Hamm plays an embarrassing sports-coach-slash-sexual-relations-counsellor – and there’s another iconic cameo.</p> <p>In the time-honoured manner, newbie Cady is taken in hand and guided through the high-school jungle by the all-knowing alienated cynical types; great work here from Jaquel Spivey as Damian and Auli’i Cravalho as Janis. They are also the movie choric narrators, bringing us into the action as if it is a 112-minute TikTok in a smartphone-shaped screen. Damian and Janis, outside the hetero-patriarchal power structure, are in an objective position to show wide-eyed Cady all the various in-crowds and power-bases, of which naturally the most fearsome are the terrifying “plastics”, the mean girls and Insta-princesses who rule the school.</p> <p>They are in turn ruled by the pouting queen of capricious blonde cruelty Regina, originally played by Rachel McAdams and now by Renée Rapp. It amuses Regina to pretend to welcome Cady into their group and Janis (who has history with Regina) encourages Cady to go along with it and infiltrate this hateful group - but could it be that Cady will like being a shallow blonde “plastic”? Among the mean girls themselves, the scene is stolen by Avantika as the outrageously vapid Karen; she gets the movie’s best song, Sexy, in the Halloween party scene. Busy Phillips is funny as Regina’s needy mom who wants to be one of her daughter’s gang more than anything.</p> <p>There are plenty of laughs and fun along the way, but the business invoking framing Ms Norbury as a drug-pusher always feels strained and unconvincing, with insufficient laughs to make it worthwhile, while the final resolution and Cady’s learning of life-lessons take a while to arrive. Some sugar-rush musical numbers, though, and the classic gags are effectively delivered.</p> <p>• Mean Girls is released on 11 Janaury in Australia, 12 January in the US and 17 January in the UK.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 8 February 2024 to remove the surname of the actor who goes by the stage name Avantika.</p>",

Staff with Clean Up the Lake, a local non-profit, and at least two dozen volunteers staged a major cleanup to clear the area, which has faced a host of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/06/california-lake-tahoe-trash-cleanup-fourth-july\">environmental problems</a> in recent years amid a surge in tourism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/12/lake-tahoe-resort-housing-crisis\">popularity</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/12/lake-tahoe-resort-housing-crisis\"> ‘Lake Tahoe has a people problem’: how a resort town became unlivable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The size of the beads, and the fact that they mixed into sand and snow, made them particularly difficult to remove, the non-profit said.</p> <p>“These beads, believed to be made of expanded polystyrene, can have detrimental effects on aquatic life and pose serious threats to the overall health of the environment,” the non-profit said in a statement. “These threats include the further breakdown of these beads into microplastics which aggravate an already troubling issue for Lake Tahoe.”</p> <p>The beads appear to be remnants of a floating dock, which may have disintegrated into at least 100,000 pieces after coming into contact with a boat ramp. The storm created large waves that threw the beads on to shore, said Colin West, the Clean Up the Lake founder.</p> <p>This week, volunteers brought pasta strainers, buckets, leafblowers and shop vacuums to clear the beads from the shoreline of the lake, famous for its striking clear turquoise waters. “We used every technique we could,” West said.</p> <p>After an extensive cleanup, volunteers managed to remove as much as 90% of the beads, but that still leaves thousands of beads mixed in the sand and snow, West said.</p> <p>“We’ve kind of done everything we can do manually,” he said. “This kind of spill is just really terrible and one of the hardest things to clean.”</p>    <p>The explosion of plastic beads is the second documented by Clean Up the Lake in recent years. West said the incident highlights the need to suspend the use of such plastics in docks and projects around the lake, and create more awareness for beachgoers to not bring anything containing the substance.</p> <p>Despite decades of efforts to protect the lake, pollution is an ongoing problem in Tahoe. Clean Up the Lake has removed 61,541lb of litter since 2018, conducting nearly 400 dives to reach trash in the far depths of the lake.</p> <p>The lake also has high concentrations of microplastics. Recent <a href=\"https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2023/lake-tahoe-microplastic\">research</a> found that of 38 lakes tested around the world, Tahoe had some of the highest concentrations of plastics.</p> <p>“It’s our collective responsibility to take care of Lake Tahoe – to pick up our trash, leave no trace, leave only footprints on the Tahoe shoreline, and to be aware that our modern-day convenient lifestyle does come at a cost,” Julie Regan, the executive director of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, <a href=\"https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2023/lake-tahoe-microplastic\">said last year</a>.</p> <p><br>• This article was amended on 18 January 2024 because an earlier version inaccurately used the term styrofoam when expanded polystyrene was meant. </p>",

What are you afraid of?”</p> <p>Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a Black Democrat, took issue with Mace’s invocation of white privilege.</p> <p>“I can’t get over the gentlelady from South Carolina talking about white privilege,” Crockett said. “It was a spit in the face, at least of mine as a Black woman, for you to talk about what white privilege looks like, especially from that side of the aisle.”</p> <p>Mace pointed to a previous role as the ranking Republican on the civil rights subcommittee and said she took “great pride as a white female Republican to address the inadequacies in our country”.</p> <p>As Marjorie Taylor Greene, the extremist Republican from Georgia, was speaking, Hunter Biden left the room. Greene, who in a previous hearing showed what appeared to be a sexually explicit picture of Biden, claimed he was “afraid of my words”.</p> <p>Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, defended Biden, saying: “I think it’s really interesting to hear the gentlelady from Georgia speak about Hunter Biden leaving, when she is the person that showed nude photos of Hunter Biden in this very committee room.” </p> <p>When Greene attempted to enter evidence into the record, Raskin protested that Democrats had not seen it, saying: “In the past, she’s displayed pornography. Are pornographic photos allowed to be displayed in this committee room?”</p> <p>Greene said her evidence was not pornographic. Raskin said: “OK, well, you’re the expert.”</p> <p>Outside, Lowell told reporters: “Republican chairs … are commandeering an unprecedented resolution to hold somebody in contempt who has offered to publicly answer all their proper questions. The question there is, what are they afraid of?”</p> <p>Republicans are targeting Biden as part of attempts to portray his father as corrupt and secure his impeachment, as an expected election rematch with Donald Trump looms. Republicans have however presented no evidence that Joe Biden profited from his son’s dealings.</p> <p>In early December, Hunter Biden, 53, defied a subpoena for testimony in private, instead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/13/hunter-biden-subpoena-republican\">appearing</a> in front of reporters on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>“Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry, or hear what I have to say,” Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/13/hunter-biden-subpoena-republican\">said</a> then. “What are they afraid of? I am here.”</p> <p>On Monday, Comer and Jordan released their contempt resolution and an attendant report. They said Biden’s “willful refusal to comply with our subpoenas constitutes contempt of Congress and warrants referral to the appropriate United States attorney’s office for prosecution.”</p> <p>Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanour criminal offence. As <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10974\">described</a> by the Congressional Research Service, “a witness suffers no direct legal consequence from House or Senate approval of a contempt citation, though a variety of political consequences may [follow]. If the individual is prosecuted and convicted, violations … are punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment ‘for not less than one month nor more than 12 months’.”</p> <p>Hunter Biden is already in extensive legal jeopardy. In September, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/14/hunter-biden-gun-charges-indictment\">indicted</a> in Delaware on three federal charges related to his purchase and ownership of a handgun while experiencing (and lying about) addiction. Facing a sentence of up to 25 years, he pleaded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/hunter-biden-arraignment-court-gun-case\">not guilty</a>.</p> <p>In December, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/07/hunter-biden-indicted-tax-charges-california\">indicted</a> in California on nine tax charges carrying a maximum sentence of 17 years. Arraignment is scheduled <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/hunter-biden-make-his-initial-court-appearance-tax-charges-jan-11-2023-12-18/\">for Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Democrats have attempted to make news of their own, releasing a report detailing at least $7.8m in payments from 20 countries to Trump business concerns during his four years in power. Comer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/trump-businesses-payment-house-investigation-china-saudi-arabia\">called</a> that report “beyond parody” and said: “Former President Trump has legitimate businesses but the Bidens do not.”</p> <p>In December, Hunter Biden said: “There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business because it did not happen …</p> <p>“I have made mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges I was afforded. For that, I am responsible. For that, I am accountable. And for that, I am making amends.”</p>",

A judge has already decided Trump committed fraud. He will rule on punishment later.</p> <p>Trump’s companies could lose their New York licenses, making it nearly impossible for him to run his real estate business. He is also facing a vast fine – state lawyers made the case for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/05/trump-civil-fraud-new-york-letitia-james\">$370m penalty on Friday</a> – which could force the company to sell off its properties.</p> <p>At this point, prosecutors and Trump’s defense team have rested their cases. Closing arguments are set to take place on Thursday.</p> <p>The last three months offered Trump and his lawyers their chance to defend Trump in court against accusations that he purposely exaggerated his net worth on government documents. Instead, they worked to uphold the shimmering portrait Trump has painted of himself for the last 40 years. The story that gave Trump celebrity and, ultimately, the White House could lead to the downfall of his company.</p>    <p>A scathing pre-trial summary judgment made the trial an uphill battle for Trump’s team. Issued on 26 September, less than a week before the trial started, the ruling said documents submitted by prosecutors showed Trump had committed fraud. The ruling is currently under review by an appellate court, but if upheld, Trump will lose his business licenses, severely curtailing his real estate business in New York.</p> <p>You can read more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/06/donald-trump-new-york-fraud-trial-business-impact\">here</a>.</p>   </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T18:20:51.872Z\">at 6.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-659ed7a18f08773a0cfe474b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joannawalters\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T17:52:21.181Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Judge bars Trump from presenting own closing arguments in fraud trial</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> will be barred from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/10/trump-closing-arguments-civil-fraud-trial\">reported aim</a> to deliver his own closing argument on Thursday in his New York civil business fraud trial.</p> <p>Judge <strong>Arthur Engoron</strong> had reportedly been prepared to allow the former president, in a highly unusual move, to address the court tomorrow in addition to his lawyers doing so.</p> <p>But fresh news now being reported by the Associated Press – Engoron has “rescinded permission”.</p> <p>Trump is a defendant in the case brought by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> attorney general, <strong>Letitia James</strong>.

House Republicans are today making their latest moves in their campaign to use the chamber’s powers against <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s allies, but the real drama may be latest bout of infighting between lawmakers over government spending. Rightwing Republicans are upset about a preliminary government funding agreement speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> agreed to with Democrats over the weekend, and the tension may heighten further today, when the GOP holds a behind-closed-doors conference meeting.</p> <p>In public, the party will be busy taking the Biden administration, and the president’s family, to task. At 10am eastern time, the House homeland security committee will hold a hearing into the failures of <strong>Alejandro Mayorkas</strong>, as part of their effort to impeach the secretary for what they say is his failure to stop the surge of migrants crossing the southern border. The oversight committee will convene at the same time to begin contempt proceedings against the president’s son <strong>Hunter Biden</strong> for not appearing for a deposition. We’ll give you the highlights of all these events.</p> <p>Here’s what else we are watching today:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre</strong> and national security council spokesman <strong>John Kirby</strong> will brief reporters at 1pm eastern time. Expect them to be pressed for more details on defense secretary <strong>Lloyd Austin</strong>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/09/lloyd-austin-prostate-cancer-defense-secretary-walter-reed\">hospitalization</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ron DeSantis</strong> will campaign in Des Moines, Iowa at 11am, with five days to go until the state’s first-in-the-nation Republican presidential caucus.</p></li> <li><p><strong>An appeals court</strong> could rule on <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s claim that he is immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election. A three-judge panel in Washington DC heard arguments yesterday, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/09/donald-trump-2020-election-federal-appeals-court-criminal-prosecution\">sounded skeptical</a> of the former president’s defense.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

Those who are part of a separate group litigation, who have already received some money, will be offered £75,000 each. It was reported that the bill of at least £450m would be footed by the taxpayer.</p> \n<p>Setting out details of the plan to MPs, the business minister responsible for postal affairs, Kevin Hollinrake, conceded that the blanket approach could mean some people fraudulently receiving compensation but that the risk was worth it to end the long wait.</p> \n<p>“This is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history,” Sunak said during prime minister’s questions. “People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and their reputations destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own. The victims must get justice and compensation.”</p> \n<p>He added: “We will make sure that the truth comes to light, we right the wrongs of the past and the victims get the justice they deserve.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6007d743-29a7-4e71-9482-4e349a5c56ca\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CWdT24dU65w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The announcement was greeted with approval from Alan Bates – the postmaster who has campaigned for 20 years to expose the scandal. “It’s about time, this was the decent thing to do,” he told the Times. “We’ve got the whole country behind us now. There’s still a lot of work to do. Once a job’s done, the job’s done, and we can relax a bit — but we’re not there yet.”</p> \n<p>The plan also won immediate backing from Labour, meaning it will pass parliament without hindrance. However, legal organisations said ministers should give assurances to parliament, and within the bill, that this was a one-off.</p> \n<p>David McNeill from the Law Society said: “Are we feeling queasy about it? Are we looking down with a sort of queasy sense of vertigo? Yes, we are. It breaches a fundamental principle which is effectively the government legislating against decisions, against the independence of the courts.</p> \n<p>“These are exceptional circumstances, it is an extraordinary measure. It must not, must never, be seen as a precedent.”<br><br>Sam Townend KC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: “We will examine the proposals carefully. Anxious care should be taken as to ensuring the independence of the judiciary and the government must be careful about setting legal and constitutional precedent.”</p> \n<p>Downing Street said: “We don’t take this step lightly and have consulted with the judiciary.”</p> \n<p>Later Scotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf confirmed that everyone convicted in Scotland as part of the scandal would likewise be cleared. Writing to Sunak, he said he wanted to work with the UK government to ensure victims across the UK were exonerated.</p> \n<p>Usually a law such as the one proposed by Sunak to quash the convictions would not have effect in Scotland, but Yousaf indicated that a legislative consent motion approved in the Scottish parliament would be the quickest way of ensuring that it did apply north of the border.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday evening, Hollinrake accepted that the pace of the response had been sped along by the ITV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/01/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office-review-toby-jones-is-perfect-in-a-devastating-tale-of-a-national-scandal\">Mr Bates vs the Post Office</a>, broadcast in four parts last week, which told the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/06/key-post-office-horizon-campaigner-mr-bates-calls-for-faster-compensation\">Alan Bates</a>, the post office operator who led the campaign against the injustice.</p> \n<p>“Of course we respond to public pressure. That’s what we’re here for,” Hollinrake said. “This is government. Things go on the ‘too difficult’ pile. There’s lots of different stakeholders involved in government.”</p> \n<p>While the plan will swiftly clear and compensate the more than 900 people prosecuted by the Post Office after being wrongly accused of taking money between 1999 and 2015, a parallel political row is still raging over responsibility for the affair.</p> \n<p>Sunak’s announcement of the plan was made in response to a seemingly planted question from Lee Anderson, the Tory party deputy chair, who called for Ed Davey, who was minister responsible for postal affairs from 2010 to 2012, to quit as Liberal Democrat leader.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/10/uk-government-urged-review-fujitsu-contracts-horizon-scandal\">attention has also fallen</a> on the Conservatives’ links to Fujitsu, which provided the faulty Horizon accounting software, on which the convictions were based.</p> \n<p>Simon Blagden, a Conservative donor who chairs the government’s Building Digital UK agency, was described by Fujitsu UK in 2015 as a member of its leadership team who sat on its UK and Ireland responsible business board, as well as being chair of one of its subsidiaries, Fujitsu Telecommunications, for 14 years from 2004 to 2019.</p> \n<p>The government said Blagden was “in no way involved” in the Horizon project and Fujitsu Telecommunications was “a separate organisation”.</p> \n<p>There are also tricky questions for some Whitehall officials about their oversight of the Post Office, including civil servants who sat on its board on behalf of the government.</p> \n<p>Susannah Storey, now permanent secretary of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and Richard Callard and Tom Cooper of UK Government Investments, were non-executive directors of the Post Office and are highly likely to be called to give evidence in the ongoing public inquiry into the convictions.</p> \n<p>Setting out the plan in the Commons immediately after Sunak spoke, Hollinrake said post office operators convicted during the relevant period would be asked to sign a statement declaring they did not commit a crime and could be prosecuted for fraud if this was false.</p> \n<p>“I do not pretend to the house that this is a foolproof device, but it is a proportionate one which respects the ordeal with which these people have already suffered,” he said.</p> \n<p>The two different classes of compensation, £600,000 and £75,000, reflect the fact that the second group, numbering 555 people, were part of a group legal action that received a settlement from the Post Office in 2019.</p> \n<p>Much of their £43m payout went to legal costs, and those in the group who believe they are entitled to more than £75,000 can also go through the assessment process.</p> \n<p>Hollinrake said he expected those who were prosecuted after taking part in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/07/post-office-suspected-of-more-wrongful-prosecutions-of-operators-over-horizon\">pilot scheme of the software</a> would also be eligible for compensation.</p> \n<p>The Post Office, which has the power to instigate prosecutions, prosecuted more than 900 branch owner-operators based on information from the Horizon system.</p> \n<p>While it eventually conceded fault, as of December just 142 appeal case reviews had been completed. Of these 93 convictions were overturned, with 54 upheld, withdrawn or refused permission to appeal.</p>",

Mr Graves has dismissed what the club has admitted, describing it as banter,” he said. “I am very concerned that we would lose the progress we have made [after] a return by Mr Graves and would need not just a statement recanting his views but full commitment to create a club for the whole community … I call on anyone who wants to see the club stay with the members, and safeguard the progress it has made, and who has the means to help to come forward.

            "body" : "<p>It’s one of the signs of impending apocalypse. The sun turns black. Beasts tremble. The Daily Mail launches its own TV talkshow. I’m going into my bunker and barricading the hatch.</p> <p>The Mail previously hosted video content on its own paid-for app, but is airing this weekly yakathon free on YouTube.</p> <p>The Reaction – a title that whiffs of a placeholder they forgot to replace – is hosted by Andrew Pierce and Sarah Vine. They bill it as “forthright opinions, a few falling-outs and hopefully some fun”. The word “hopefully” does a lot of heavy lifting.</p> <p>If you’ve never heard of these hip young gunslingers, I envy you. Vine is a superannuated columnist and former spouse of Michael Gove. She still holds court on the hellsite-formerly-known-as-Twitter under the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WestminsterWAG\">@WestminsterWAG</a>, despite she and Gove divorcing two years ago.</p> <p>Her co-presenter Pierce hosts a morning show on GB News and has the social media moniker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toryboypierce\">@toryboypierce</a> (how impartial). The duo claim to have been friends for 20 years, hence having all the easy chemistry of late-stage Holly and Phil.</p> <p>This launch was hyped on the Mail’s front page with the headline: “What WILL Sarah Vine and Andrew Pierce say about Jason Donovan’s bod at 55 AND his black nail varnish!” (The shouty caps and lack of a question mark are theirs.) Hardly a hot button issue. All the various scandals, conflicts and crises in the news? Nah, let’s go for Scott from Neighbours’ mildly surprising manicure.</p> <p>The half-hour runtime is divided into three parts: Nuclear Reaction (the Post Office saga), Royal Reaction (“poor old Prince Andrew”) and Allergic Reaction (the celebrity stories vexing our hosts). They also crowbar in some anti-trans rhetoric, seemingly for the sake of it.</p> <p>Like a culture wars Statler and Waldorf, neither has a good word to say about anyone. Former post office operator Alan Bates is sneeringly described as a “now saintly figure”. Nicola Sturgeon is “horrible and ghastly”, George Clooney “a woke warrior”, Amal Clooney “a human rights bore”.</p> <p>Despite the Duke of York’s links to convicted sex traffickers, the Duchess of Sussex is “the least popular royal and deservedly so”. This wearying negativity even extends to Oxo cubes, which Vine decries as “disgusting” before clapping her hand over her mouth. Pierce gently points out that Oxo is probably a major Mail advertiser.</p> <p>The trouble is, this live TV lark is actually quite difficult. Ominously, the show started four minutes late. The hosts often gaze down the wrong camera or forget to look at one at all. Together with a lack of viewer interaction, this has an excluding effect. It feels like Vine and Pierce are chatting to each other but blanking the audience.</p> <p>There’s a reason why journalists tend to specialise in either print or broadcast – because for every transferable skill that overlaps, there’s one that doesn’t. Vine is accustomed to appearing as a talking head on such illustrious institutions as Piers Morgan Uncensored and The Darren Grimes Show. Hosting one’s own vehicle is a whole different rodeo. She looks flustered and loses her thread. Pierce is slicker, albeit inordinately pleased with himself.</p> <p>They forget several names they try to drop. Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer Alan Dershowitz becomes “Dersh-something-or-other”. The 007 actor Daniel Craig is “Daniel what’s-he-called”. Diver Tom Daley, who soon turns 30, is “that sweet little boy”. Viewers are promised “big-name guests”. There is no sign of any name of any magnitude.</p> <p>It is all drily non-visual, too. Not a single clip is used, just the odd still. Producers effectively plonked cameras in front of a podcast and hoped it qualified as television. At the time of writing, it has clocked up 2,500 views. A livestreamed Oxo cube would probably get more.</p> <p>The Mail gleefully lambasts the BBC and Channel 4 at every opportunity. At least programmes on those broadcasters have a sheen of professionalism. The same can’t be said for Vine and Pierce’s effort, which is like being stuck at the world’s worst dinner party. Pass the polenta and try not to mention Brexit, you’ll only set them off again.</p> <p>The Reaction calls itself “a new kind of talkshow”. I suppose it is, just not in a good way. You’d hope this flailing first attempt might be a chastening lesson. Perhaps they’ll realise its shortcomings, retool the format or hire warmer hosts.</p> <p>Dream on. They’ll dismiss criticism as “liberal bias” and double down on their windbaggery. If you need me, I’ll be in my bunker.</p>",

They also reached the playoffs in 10 of Carroll’s 14 seasons in charge although some believe they should have won more than one Super Bowl with their strong defense and quarterback Russell Wilson in his prime. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/02/how-bad-was-the-seahawks-play-call-at-the-end-of-super-bowl-xlix\">Carroll received particularly strong criticism</a> for his decision to pass the ball on the goalline in the final moments of Super Bowl XLIX instead of handing the ball to All Pro running back Marshawn Lynch. Wilson was subsequently intercepted and the New England Patriots won the title.</p> <p>Carroll also had stints as head coach of the Patriots and New York Jets. He had a successful career in college football with USC, with whom he won two national titles.</p> <p>Carroll is one of only three head coaches to have won a Super Bowl and a college football National Championship, alongside Barry Switzer and Jimmy Johnson.</p>",

We know that healthy children make healthy families – that much is common sense – but we also know that if you want to know whether a country is going in the right or wrong direction, you need look no further than the nation’s children.</p> <p>How we treat our children says so much about our priorities. The official, independent statistics don’t lie. When I first looked at them, I was angered and shocked by the story they told and it’s happening in plain sight.</p> <p>The mental health of young people is a serious cause for concern, with <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-11-22\">200,000 children</a> waiting for mental health treatment, and many regularly skipping school. The number of children and young people admitted to hospital with an eating disorder <a href=\"https://natcen.ac.uk/eating-disorders-amongst-children-and-young-people-during-covid-19-pandemic#:~:text=Rather%20worryingly%2C%20hospital%20admissions%20for,to%206%2C713%20in%202020%2F21\">increased by 90%</a> in the five years up to 2021. The figure was <a href=\"https://www.thelondoncentre.co.uk/the-blog/understanding-the-rise-of-eating-disorders-in-the-uk-2022\">up by over a third</a> (35%) in 2021/22.<br><br>More children are becoming unhealthy, with <a href=\"https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/news-events/news/rcpch-responds-latest-childhood-obesity-figures-england-202223#:~:text=It%20is%20unacceptable%20that%20children,even%20a%20shorter%20life%20span.\">two in every five</a> leaving primary school overweight. But most damning of all, the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/labour-wes-streeting-tooth-decay-children/\">number one reason</a> for young children being admitted to hospital is to extract rotten teeth – because it is so difficult to get NHS dental treatment before tooth decay sets in. And incredibly, after 14 years of the Tories, the rise in <a href=\"https://datacommons.org/tools/timeline#&amp;place=country/GBR&amp;statsVar=LifeExpectancy_Person\">life expectancy has stalled</a>.</p> <p>This is not the result of bad luck, but design. Not because the Tories wake up every day wanting to harm our children, but because of the inability of this government to form any kind of medium- or long-term strategy.</p> <p>If parents treated their own children the way this government has treated the nation’s children, the word being used would be “neglect”. Our children are the biggest casualty of this kind of “sticking plaster” politics – a pattern of short-term patches when things have reached crisis point, rather than fixing the fundamentals.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak’s refusal, when chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/02/education-recovery-chief-kevan-collins-quit-english-schools-catch-up-row\">to fund the Covid recovery</a> plan for schools proposed by the Tories’ own recovery tsar is just one concrete example of the Tories failing to do their duty to the millions of children whose mental wellbeing suffered so much during lockdown. This is why change can’t come soon enough.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/jan/07/labour-vows-tackle-school-absences-broken-relationship-families\">Labour vows to tackle school absences and ‘broken relationship’ with families</a> </p> </aside>  <p><br>If we want to get our children’s future back, we need to rekindle our sense of ambition and to plan once more for the long term. It will require us to do things differently. That is what our national health mission is about – to get the NHS back on its feet by reforming the NHS and providing a new focus on prevention. To do so we need to bring the NHS closer to people and use the extraordinary developments in technology to treat patients more quickly and more effectively.</p> <p>None of this will happen without a genuine and respectful partnership with professionals and parents to improve our children’s health. That’s why today, I am meeting patients, parents and professionals in the north-west as we publish Labour’s child health action plan.</p> <p>First, it’s about getting children the care and support they need. It means saving children’s teeth, with a plan for dentistry that gives children access to more emergency appointments – 700,000 more appointments will be paid for by ending non-dom tax status for the super-rich. We will also introduce free breakfast clubs in every primary school so that every child gets a healthy meal to start the day.</p> <p>Second, we need a generation of happier children. For the health of the country, we need to end the mental health crisis. Tackling problems early is essential. That’s why Labour will cut waiting lists for mental health treatment by putting 8,500 more mental health staff in the system. We will also introduce specialist mental health support for children in schools, delivering an open access mental health hub for every community.</p> <p>Third, we need to do far more to prevent ill health. We can’t go on allowing vaping to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/21/chris-whitty-calls-for-urgent-action-over-marketing-of-vapes-to-children-in-england\">targeted at children</a> and we will end the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/08/sunak-faces-backlash-over-delay-to-junk-food-pre-watershed-ads-ban\">advertising of junk food</a> before the 9pm watershed. We’ve also got to get all children doing physical activity in schools. This is a national imperative. Healthy, happy children is not something nice to have, it’s a basic right that has economic urgency. We want the next generation to be chasing their dreams, not a dentist’s appointment.</p> <p>If we let children grow up overweight, with poor mental health and rotten teeth, we are not only harming their life chances, but adding a huge burden on the NHS and making the chances of delivering a more prosperous economy that much harder.</p> <p>More than that, if health spending balloons to cope with an epidemic of poor health, there will never be any money for investment in our schools, roads and vital infrastructure.</p> <p>I’ve talked about how Labour has changed and is back in service of working people, and today’s plan is another important building block in the development of a manifesto that will provide the hope the country needs and the future our children deserve. A vote for Labour will be a vote for national renewal, to make 2024 the year Britain’s politics changed fundamentally. We want a new politics, one that serves your interests and those of the next generation.<br><br>Our children’s future will be on the ballot paper at the election this year. So will the future of the NHS, and that election cannot come soon enough for me. In the coming months, I will be in every region of the country, sharing our plans and tapping into the expertise in every community.

For a brief period – six days – the Houthis paused, before at 9.15pm on Tuesday launching their most sophisticated attack yet.</p> \n<p>Eighteen drones, described by the British as of Iranian design, and three missiles appear to have targeted a fleet of warships in and around the 18-mile-wide Bab el-Mandab strait, where the Red Sea comes closest to Houthi-controlled Yemen. Though they were all shot down, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/britain-warns-severe-consequences-houthi-attack-red-sea-repelled\">the brazen nature of the attack was not lost on western politicians</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/britain-warns-severe-consequences-houthi-attack-red-sea-repelled\">Britain warns of severe consequences after Houthi attack in Red Sea repelled</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, on a trip to Bahrain, the only Arab country to publicly sign up to last week’s warning, said on Wednesday: “If this continues, as it did yesterday, there will be consequences.” In Britain, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said “watch this space” and warned the current situation “cannot continue”.</p> \n<p>What began as an opportunistic Houthi campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/20/yemen-houthi-rebels-seize-cargo-ship-galaxy-leader-red-sea-israel\">targeting merchant shipping travelling south of the Suez Canal in mid October</a> – in support of Hamas in Gaza – appears to have become something different: a determined attempt to attack and provoke a retaliation from Washington as the US electoral cycle is heating up, bringing the UK and other allies alongside.</p> \n<p>Prior to Tuesday night, 61 drones had been fired in 25 attacks. But in the early evening, a group of 18, probably the relatively inexpensive delta-wing Shahed 136, appear to have been aimed at the warships directly. Seven were shot down by HMS Diamond, which Shapps told reporters “potentially was targeted”.</p> \n<p>Attacking in a swarm is a tactic taken from Ukraine, where several Shahed drones are deployed in an effort to overwhelm local air defences – and even when they are all stopped, it imposes costs on the defenders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/red_sea_attacks_100124/giv-13425PkcVrKpBqoo9/\" data-alt=\"Red Sea drone attacks map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/red_sea_attacks_100124/giv-13425PkcVrKpBqoo9/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>A Shahed 136 costs $20,000 (£16,000) to make, while missiles for HMS Diamond’s Sea Viper defence system cost £1m to £2m a time, although the costs of losing a warship – or human lives – is far greater.</p> \n<p>But the risks of a Houthi drone getting through are potentially worse, spurring arguments in Washington that the US should take a more active approach.</p> \n<p>“If we only sit there in a defensive posture, eventually one of these missiles or drones will get through and kill sailors,” said Michael Allen, a former White House national security policy specialist.</p> \n<p>Last month, one former US commander of the Central Command in the Middle East, Gen Joseph Votel, <a href=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/former-centcom-commanders-us-strikes-houthis/\">suggested the US could target</a> coastal radars, coastal gun systems and missile systems, which he argued were “very clear military targets”. But it is very unlikely that one round of western airstrikes would halt the raids in the Red Sea.</p> \n<p>Battle-hardened after years of fighting in Yemen’s long civil war, the Houthis enjoy Iranian backing and military aid. Describing them as rebels is simplistic: the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimates their military is 20,000-strong and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emZffRVU5PY\">a parade in September showed an organised military</a> of some scale, which would be determined to show it had not been beaten by whatever the US attacked with.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"053814f2-998a-4713-af9e-4533bf5232cc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rB9KL6Pom5I?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, any extended conflict risks further disaster for Yemen. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/24/houthi-attacks-on-israel-jeopardise-saudi-peace-efforts-in-yemen\">Peace talks were close to ending the nine-year conflict</a> before 7 October and in some western quarters there is desperate anxiety about a US retaliation, because of the risk to civilians of any military action, however calibrated it is.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday night, Blinken’s rhetoric in Bahrain was markedly similar to the warning the Houthis had ignored the week before, perhaps suggesting a wider western military response was not imminent.</p> \n<p>But it is also hard to see the emboldened Houthis stopping their campaign, given their access to relatively cheap missiles and drones and desire to show resistance to the west.</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 11 January 2023.

That total included 104,551 outpatient appointments and 9,228 elective – or non-urgent – operations. But the true number of appointments postponed is “likely to be even higher in reality”, Powis said, because many hospitals now scheduled less care on days when junior doctors would be on strike.</p> <p>It will take hospitals “weeks and months” to recover from the six-day stoppage, Powis has said.</p> <p>Junior doctors have gone on strike on 34 days over the last 10 months. The British Medical Association (BMA) junior doctors committee is planning to ballot its 47,000 members for the third time about strike action, which if backed by enough of them could result in action continuing until September.</p> <p>NHS leaders want the BMA to start talking again to Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, about resolving the dispute, after five weeks of negotiations late last year ended in deadlock. The government has imposed a pay rise averaging 8.8% on junior doctors for the current financial year and offered a further 3%.</p> <p>But the BMA has dismissed the extra 3% as too little to address junior doctors’ demand for “full pay restoration”, given they have experienced a 26.2% fall in the value of their salaries since 2008-09. It has urged Atkins to make a “final” offer that is “credible” enough for them to put to junior doctors in a ballot.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation hospitals group, said the 1.3m total of cancelled appointments was “a significant underestimate because trusts have pre-emptively avoided making appointments during periods of industrial action, so the actual number of cancelled appointments could be double this”.</p> <p>The scale of disruption to scheduled care meant it would be “a long time” before hospitals had managed to rebook and provide the appointments postponed over the last week, Taylor added.</p> <p>All the industrial action over the last 13 months has cost about £2bn so far, NHS England estimates. Paying staff to cover for those on strike has cost about £1bn while hospitals have lost about the same sum again because they have not been able to perform operations that NHS England pays them to do.</p> <p>For example, Milton Keynes hospital lost £1m after it had to cancel 200 outpatient appointments and more than 100 operations during the six-day strike, which began last Wednesday. The £1m was from “a combination of having to pay consultants more to cover services and a number of patients we haven’t treated”, Prof Joe Harrison, its chief executive, told the BBC.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak has been criticised by the BMA and the factchecking charity Full Fact for wrongly claiming at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that other groups of NHS staff, including “consultants and speciality doctors”, had already “reached a fair and reasonable pay settlement with the government”.</p> <p>Both groups of doctors are still being balloted by the BMA to see if they accept what ministers have offered. Both have threatened to strike if their members reject the respective offers.</p>",

Same-sex relations can also be subjected to severe penalties, as well as open displays of support for LGBTI causes, even on social media.”</p> <p>Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said the briefing showed the challenges of operating in Saudi Arabia, as much by what it missed out as what it included. “I see a gap in information for women fans,” she said. “Perhaps it’s assuming they don’t exist or that they have the same needs as male fans, which is just incorrect. The Saudi guardianship system presents risks to women which are not at all considered. Equally there is no mention as to the risks in terms of information security.</p> <p>“This briefing serves as a reminder that there is currently no human rights framework for fans, players, journalists or anyone else travelling to Saudi Arabia for a sporting event. This is the main problem and what is required is due diligence to establish the risks people might face.”</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has banned human rights organisations from working in the country, making it almost impossible for a full assessment of risks to be conducted. At the same time it continues to ramp up its investment in sporting events – from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/nov/04/clownish-populist-infantino-is-complicit-in-saudi-arabias-colonisation-of-football\" title=\"\">the World Cup</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/04/saudi-arabia-to-host-2029-asian-winter-games-at-desert-megacity-neom-trojena\" title=\"\">the Asian Winter Games of 2029</a> – in an attempt to drive greater foreign tourism to the country.</p> <p>“You can’t meet with anyone in Saudi Arabia to do due diligence,” Worden said. “You have no ability to do basic human rights assessments because there’s no one to meet with, they’re all in jail. At the same time, you don’t carry out your responsibilities just by saying: ‘If you’re going to be a fan don’t be gay.’ And, by the way, the same goes for heterosexual fans: you can’t kiss if you win.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Ecuador’s president, Daniel Noboa, said on Wednesday that his country was “at war” with drug gangs who are holding more than 130 prison staff hostage and who briefly captured a TV station live on air, in a wave of violence that has left city streets deserted.</p> \n<p>At least 10 people have been killed, including police officers, in the attacks.</p> \n<p>In images that went around the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/ecuador-gangs-wave-terror-state-of-emergency\">gunmen stormed a TV station</a> during a live broadcast on Tuesday before being captured by police special forces.</p> \n<p>Videos posted on social media showed a gruesome series of other attacks including car bombs, the murder of police officers in the street, the apparent lynching of prison guards and attempted takeovers of hospitals and a university in Guayaquil. The Ecuadorian police <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PoliciaEcuador/status/1744896680674124033\">confirmed two officers</a> had been killed.</p> \n<p>“We are fighting narco-terrorism,” Noboa said in a radio interview on Wednesday. Referring to videos showing the apparent murder of prison guards, he said: “They disseminate images to frighten the public and to bring the president of the republic to his knees, and that is not going to happen.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I sympathise with the families. We are in a state of war and we cannot give in.”</p> \n<p>The wave of violence prompted the Ecuadorian president to issue a decree on Tuesday designating nearly two dozen gangs as terrorist groups and authorised Ecuador’s military to “neutralise” the crime factions “within the bounds of international humanitarian law”.</p> \n<p>“They have created a wave of violence to frighten the populace,” Adm Jaime Vela, head of the joint command of the armed forces, said on Tuesday. “From this moment on, every terrorist group identified in the aforementioned decree has become a military objective.”</p> \n<p>Noboa, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/daniel-noboa-wins-ecuador-presidential-election\">elected in October</a> on a promise to crack down on violent crime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/ecuador-adolfo-macias-fito-missing-gang-leader\">declared a two-month state of emergency</a> late on Monday, in response to jail violence – including hostage-takings of guards by prisoners – and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/ecuador-adolfo-macias-fito-missing-gang-leader\">escape of Adolfo Macías, alias Fito</a>, the leader of Los Choneros gang, over the weekend.</p> \n<p>The government has said the violence is a reaction to Noboa’s plan to build two new high-security prisons for gang leaders modelled on the design used by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/02/the-guardian-view-on-el-salvadors-crackdown-a-short-term-high-cost-fix\">El Salvador’</a>s controversial president, Nayib Bukele, who has built the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/27/el-salvador-nayib-bukele-gangs-mass-trials\">largest prison in the Americas</a> to house 70,000 alleged gang members amid mounting human rights concerns about due process and the imprisonment of innocent people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b03fa532-bfa2-4ef3-a343-7a879eb07529\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O1gEb3USJPQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking last week, Noboa said the planned prisons would be “just the same” as those in El Salvador, jokingly inviting “Bukele lovers”, referring to supporters of the Salvadorian president, to visit.</p> \n<p>Prison transfers of gang leaders have historically led to violence, with hundreds of prisoners killed in recent years.</p> \n<p>Ecuador’s prison service said 139 guards and other staff were being held hostage in jails amid uncorroborated videos showing apparent lynchings and killings of prison staff. Eleven prison guards had been released, it added.</p> \n<p>Businesses and offices were closed in most Ecuadorian cities and children were sent home to study online until the end of the week.</p> \n<p>Video footage showed gunfights between soldiers and unseen armed men in southern Ecuador, while other images on social media showed armed men on the streets and traffic at a standstill.</p> \n<p>Authorities in Guayaquil said there were “takeover” incidents at five hospitals, but that police and soldiers had restored order. It was unclear what the incidents entailed.</p> \n<p>The city’s roads were eerily quiet and there was scant sign of the major military deployment promised by Ecuador’s president.</p> \n<p>Guayaquil’s normally bustling La Bahia market was a ghost town on Wednesday afternoon with only a handful of its hundreds of metal stalls open for business.</p> \n<p>“We are paralyzed. We are utterly paralyzed. The whole city is like this,” said watch repairer Juan Ciro Granados Criollo, 70, who could only remember seeing the region so empty on one other occasion: during the Covid pandemic.</p> \n<p>Martha Sanchez, a 38-year-old shop keeper, said she felt consumed by uncertainty. “Truth be told, I’m afraid,” she admitted, calling for the government to respond to the criminal attacks with “a firm hand”. “Everything is absolute chaos.”</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, Peru declared an emergency along its northern border with Ecuador. The country’s prime minister, Alberto Otárola, made the announcement, noting that the emergency declaration would deploy an unspecified number of army troops to support police forces and that the country’s defence and interior ministers would also travel to the border.</p> \n<p>The assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs at the US state department, Brian A Nichols, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHAAsstSecty/status/1744881891751133550\">said on X</a> that he was “extremely concerned by today’s violence &amp; kidnappings in Ecuador. The United States stands with the people of Ecuador.”</p> \n<p>Noboa said the country would begin to deport foreign prisoners, especially Colombians, this week to reduce prison populations and spending.</p> \n<p>There are about 1,500 Colombians in prison in Ecuador, Noboa told the radio station, adding that prisoners from Colombia, Peru and Venezuela accounted for 90% of jailed foreigners.</p> \n<p>Colombia’s justice minister told local radio on Tuesday he was willing to work with Ecuador, but that Colombian law dictated that repatriations must be assessed on a case-by-case basis and be based on requests from prisoners themselves.</p> \n<p>Colombia has, like many Latin American countries, expressed its support for Ecuador’s government, and said on Wednesday it would increase military presence and controls along their nearly 600km (370-mile) shared border.</p>",

So it’s also the responsibility of families, and clearly the responsibility of schools as well. It’s the responsibility of society as a whole.”</p> <p>Attal, 34, a savvy political communicator and former education minister, was appointed as France’s youngest ever prime minister this week by the centrist president Emmanuel Macron who is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/gabriel-attals-real-challenge-will-be-to-break-french-parliaments-political-deadlock\">reinvigorate his second term</a> and limit possible gains by Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in June’s European elections.</p> <p>Attal is expected to appoint a new government by the end of the week, with the hardliner, Gérald Darmanin, who accompanied his police station visit, expected to remain interior minister.</p> <p>Attal’s first 24 hours in office appeared to indicate how the new prime minister is going to try to appeal to voters who have turned to the far right or abstained from elections. He sought to show not just authority, but also a willingness to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/macrons-appeal-to-unity-succeeds-but-far-right-makes-strong-showing\"> </a>listen more closely – and with greater empathy – to low and middle-income workers struggling to make ends meet or deal with the difficulties of housing or education.</p> <p>Borrowing an idea from Nicolas Sarkozy’s successful 2007 presidential campaign, Attal appealed on Tuesday to workers who see their daily lives as a struggle, addressing the hard-working, but often low-paid French people who “wake up early”. His appointment was seen as a way to regain momentum for Macron, but also to reach beyond the president’s core voters, who tend to be higher-income and retirees.</p> <p>Attal is also being presented in the media as a more human, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/gabriel-attal-french-prime-minister\">approachable face</a> of centrist politics. He is France’s first openly gay prime minister and has spoken about his own experience of bullying.</p> <p>In 2021, when France adopted a law allowing single women and lesbians access to medically assisted reproduction, Attal posted on Instagram photos of himself as a baby, saying he was born via such a practice and said it “can now benefit millions of other families who until now have been unfairly deprived of it”.</p> <p>In comments made during a trip to see people hit by flood damage in northern France on Tuesday night, Attal was keen to be seen as empathic; Macron himself has been accused at various points in his presidency of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/gabriel-attals-real-challenge-will-be-to-break-french-parliaments-political-deadlock\">arrogant or cut off</a>.</p> <p>Attal promised villagers: “No one will forget you.” He told one cafe owner whose premises had been flooded not to give up; that she represented the France that gets up early and that he’d come back to drink a coffee with her.</p> <p>In the village of Clairmarais he said he wanted to show the whole country’s “solidarity” with those experiencing flood damage.</p> <p>Attal began politics on the centrist wing of the Socialist party, before joining Macron’s centrist project. But as education minister he presented policies that appealed to the right, and which the National Rally said were borrowed from their own far-right manifesto. These included trials of uniform in schools and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/28/france-to-ban-girls-from-wearing-abayas-in-state-schools\">banning schoolgirls from wearing abayas</a>. </p> <p>As budget minister, he was also quick to address the far right’s arguments that high taxes were not being properly spent on public services. He led a drive to explain to voters how their money was being spent.</p> <p>Widespread public discontent over surging living costs and last year’s contested pension reform have seriously hit Macron’s approval ratings, and has affected polling for the European parliament election, where Macron’s centrist party is trailing behind Le Pen’s.</p> <p>Attal has polled as one of France’s most popular politicians in recent months.</p> <p>Brigitte Macron, the president’s wife, said on a TV programme on Tuesday that Attal was “a man of action”.</p>",

But judge Arthur Engoron rescinded permission for the speech.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/10/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-iowa-republican-debate-candidates\">Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis to face off in Iowa Republican debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an email exchange, the judge requested Trump agree to certain conditions – requiring he focused only on the facts of the case, and refrained from introducing new evidence, or commenting on “irrelevant matters” – to formally address the court.</p> <p>Engoron also stressed that Trump would not be allowed to deliver “a campaign speech”, or “impugn myself, my staff, plaintiff, plaintiff’s staff, or the New York state court system”.</p> <p>The former president’s legal team would not agree to these terms.</p> <p>“I won’t debate this yet again,” Engoron wrote on Wednesday, after Trump’s lawyers pushed back. “Take it or leave it. Now or never. You have until noon, seven minutes from now. I WILL NOT GRANT ANY FURTHER EXTENSIONS.”</p> <p>When Trump’s lawyers failed to respond in time, Engoron followed up with another email.</p> <p>“Not having heard from you by the third extended deadline,” he wrote, “I assume that Mr Trump will not agree to the reasonable, lawful limits I have imposed as a precondition to giving a closing statement above and beyond those given by his attorneys, and that, therefore, he will not be speaking in court tomorrow.”</p> <p>The exchange, disclosed in court filings, also revealed that Trump had requested on Tuesday evening that this week’s court date be postponed until later this month following the death of his mother-in-law. His lawyers cited “the challenges presented by this deeply personal family matter”.</p> <p>Engoron denied the request, however. “I am sorry to hear the sad news,” he wrote, before explaining that “every appearance of Mr Trump requires court officers, court clerks, administrators, security details, technical people, etc to rearrange their schedules and to plan for the day”.</p> <p>Trump is a defendant in the case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James. She claims his net worth was inflated by billions of dollars on financial statements that helped him secure business loans and insurance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/10/donald-trump-bedlam-criminal-cases\">Trump warns of ‘bedlam’ if criminal cases bar him from White House</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An attorney for Trump informed Engoron earlier this week that the former president wished to speak during the closing arguments, and the judge approved the plan, according to one of the two people who spoke to the Associated Press.</p> <p>Both persons who confirmed the plan did so on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the information to reporters.</p> <p>The Trump campaign and a spokesperson for James declined to comment.</p> <p>The former president and current Republican frontrunner denies any wrongdoing, and he has condemned the case during a peppery day of testimony, on social media and in verbal comments in the courthouse hallway.</p> <p>In recent days on his Truth Social platform, he called the case a “hoax”, dismissed the months-long proceedings as as a “pathetic excuse for a trial”, and criticized the judge and the attorney general, both Democrats.</p> <p>But delivering a summation would have been another matter.</p> <p>Although some people represent themselves, it is highly uncommon for defendants personally to give summations if they have attorneys to do so. Trump has several, and he is not a lawyer.</p> <p>In closing arguments, both sides give their views of what the evidence has shown and why they should win. It is each camp’s last chance to try to persuade the ultimate decision-maker – in this case, Judge Engoron.</p> <p>Trump’s plans regarding the trial have changed before. In December, he was scheduled to testify as a witness for a second time, but he canceled the day before, saying he had “nothing more to say”.</p> <p>James’s office says Trump, his business and some top executives defrauded banks and insurers by hugely goosing the values of assets such as his triplex at Trump Tower in New York and his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida.</p> <p>The state claims the bigger numbers got Trump better rates, while lenders and insurers didn’t get the information they needed to make a truly informed assessment of the risk they were taking on and what they should charge for it.</p> <p>The “defendants reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains through their unlawful conduct”, state lawyers wrote in a court filing on Friday. They are seeking $370m in penalties, plus interest, and a ban on Trump doing business in New York.</p> <p>The defense says Trump more than qualified for the deals he got – and say he upheld his end of them, including by repaying all the loans. He and his lawyers maintain that his financial statements were clearly offered as unaudited estimates that recipients should check out for themselves, and that the net worth numbers were far too low, not the opposite. Any overstatements were just errors too small to affect the bottom line, the defense says.</p> <p>“There have been no losses to any party, as the loans here were negotiated between very sophisticated parties,” Trump lawyers Christopher Kise and Michael T Madaio wrote Friday in court papers. “Lenders made their own informed decisions.”</p> <p>Engoron will weigh claims of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records. He has said he hopes to have a verdict by the end of this month.</p> <p>He decided the lawsuit’s top claim before trial, ruling that Trump and other defendants engaged in fraud for years. The judge then ordered that a receiver take control of some of the ex-president’s properties, but an appeals court has frozen that order for now.</p>",

He played a key role in F1’s recent surge in popularity, especially in the US.</p> <p>The US-based team – whose factory is located in Banbury, Oxfordshire – announced on Wednesday the 58-year-old will be replaced by their former director of engineering Ayao Komatsu. It is understood Steiner was not sacked but that his contract, which had concluded, was not renewed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/08/fia-technical-director-tim-goss-leaves-formula-one\">FIA technical director Tim Goss leaves Formula One’s governing body</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Steiner became one of the breakout stars of the Netflix series Drive to Survive, his blunt outspoken attitude towards his role and often his drivers, along with his inventive and explosive bouts of swearing, proved hugely popular with viewers. His public appearances often attracted more fans than those of his drivers and last year he published a bestselling book.

Steiner is also understood to have been instrumental in recruiting the team’s title sponsor, MoneyGram.</p> <p>“It was clear we needed to improve our on-track performances,” Haas said. “We have had success but we need to be consistent in delivering results that help us reach our wider goals as an organisation.”</p> <p>As well as being an enormously colourful personality, Steiner was admired and respected in the paddock, not least for delivering with limited resources. The team was formed with the intent of using as many stock parts as were legally possible from Ferrari to keep development costs down.</p> <p>The model was criticised by other teams, with Haas building only the chassis and aerodynamics on their car, but it proved to be successful in allowing them to go racing without the expense of similar sized teams. However, their limited ability to develop their own direction for the car has proved to be a repeated setback they have yet to overcome.</p> <p>Komatsu has been with the team since 2016 and will be expected to focus on the team’s performance with a new role being created to handle the non-competitive management of the team.</p>",

They also object to familiar “brands” such as Wasps or London Irish being parachuted into a reshaped second tier, arguing that clubs which have gone out of business should be required to repay their debts in full before being eligible for inclusion.</p> <p>The huge reduction in central funding from the RFU over recent years is another serious bone of contention and Nottingham’s chairman, Alistair Bow, suggests the union’s representatives have treated talks with the Championship sides as “a tick‑box exercise” which allows them to say they have given the Championship clubs a realistic opportunity to be part of a brighter future.</p> <p>Bow even alleges that high-profile Twickenham executives have not been properly engaging in the discussions. “When you go to a meeting they can’t actually remember what they told us in the previous meeting. They twist it to suit their own agenda on that particular day. It gets extremely frustrating, especially when the chief executive will sit there and spend the whole time on his phone. It’s very difficult when you’ve got some people who obviously don’t want to engage.</p> <p>“I think we are being seen as the problem child. But I do think we’ve got unity, and if we can get the council and the government not to approve the tier-two proposal and the PGP without all the details being discussed, then I think we actually have a chance. The Premiership need a route through for their players. At the moment we feel there is too much effort from the RFU executive to find a solution for just 10 Premiership clubs.”</p> <p>Simon Halliday, chairman of the Championship committee, says his members have no plans to break away but criticised the plan to recommend the PGP deal to the RFU Council, with a potential vote being conducted next month, as “extremely premature”. He stressed alternative proposals had been made to the RFU and Championship officials also say their clubs’ outstanding Covid loans to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which total around £5m, could become an issue and need to be taken into account.</p> <p>“We have discussed this matter with Sport England because without further clarity on funding and governance, it will be impossible to ensure Championship clubs are able to repay their Covid loans,” read a Championship statement. “We believe they share our concerns.”</p> <p>The former Leicester chief executive Simon Cohen firmly believes that the national team needs a strong, meritocratic Championship, particularly with future Premiership squads due to be restricted to 37 senior players and 12 young academy transition players. “If they want the best possible England team then they need the Championship clubs,” Cohen said.</p> <p>“England are lacking in players coming through and depth in certain positions. They need that game time and they need that game time in the right environment.”</p> <p>Bow, meanwhile, said the idea of fast-tracking clubs such as Wasps back into a “Premiership Two” league was “an absolute no-no” from his perspective. “Unless you have paid all your debts back – rugby debts as well as government debts – you should not even be considered to come back into the league,” he said.</p> <p>“If one is allowed to do it then others will follow suit. Or if you are allowed in under the RFU regulations you should join at the bottom of the pyramid, as plenty of other clubs have done over the years.”</p> <p>In another twist the RFU has formally confirmed Doncaster have applied to be considered eligible for Premiership promotion if they finish top of the Championship this season and, as per the existing arrangements, win a playoff against the bottom Premiership side. In that event, however, Halliday said any parachute payments for the relegated side would be blocked.</p> <p>“If it were to be passed for Doncaster to go into the Premiership, under acceptable conditions, there is no way we’re going to allow a parachute payment. Not a chance.”</p>",

Most of the victims have been Palestinians, but they include three Israeli hostages, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/15/israeli-military-says-its-troops-shot-and-killed-three-hostages-by-mistake\">who were killed after they escaped Hamas captivity in December</a>.

She was waving a white flag and walking beside a young child.</p> \n<p>In the wake of Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israel, which killed 1,200 people, most international focus has been on the war in Gaza, where the death toll has climbed to more than 23,000 and most of the population is displaced and starving.</p> \n<p>But violence against Palestinians – by both Israeli military and settlers – has also risen sharply in the West Bank, with 326 killed, a quarter of them children. Israelis have also injured nearly 600 children.</p> \n<p>“Violence has reached unprecedented levels [in the West Bank],” said the Unicef spokesman Jonathan Crick. “Eighty-five Palestinian children have been killed in the past 12 weeks – more than double the number of children killed in all of 2022 – amid increased military and law enforcement operations.”</p> \n<p>“Unicef is extremely concerned about the right of children in the West Bank … to safety and protection, and their inherent right to life.”</p> \n<p>The second West Bank video comes from a security camera in the city of Tulkarm, where Israel’s border police said on Monday they had killed three gunmen in a raid to arrest a militant.</p> \n<p>The footage shows Israeli security forces shooting at young men, at least one of them armed, as they rush out of a house, Reuters reported. An Israeli military vehicle approaches two men who had been hit in the street and drives over one, stopping on the man’s legs.</p> \n<p>Footage apparently recorded later shows a vehicle backing over the body and then manoeuvring over it twice more.</p> \n<p>It is not clear if the man is dead or alive the first time he is run over. Israel has previously been accused of desecrating the bodies of Palestinians killed in Gaza.</p> \n<p>The Israeli border police said the security vehicle had come to extricate Israeli forces under heavy fire, and ran over the body unintentionally, Reuters reported. The incident is under review, the military added.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs said the incident reflected a “culture of hatred and extremism”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>It was unprecedented, the minister conceded, but the legal profession was quick to insist that Wednesday afternoon’s developments should not be mistaken for the setting of a precedent.</p> <p>Addressing the House of Commons over the Post Office scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/post-office-scandal-tv-drama-horizon\">has erupted this week</a>, the minister for postal affairs, Kevin Hollinrake, announced that the government would be driving a horse and cart through the constitutional separation of powers of the judiciary, executive and legislature.</p> <p>Legislation will be drafted to exonerate each of those convicted on the basis of misleading Horizon computer evidence in England and Wales between 1999 and 2015, when post office operators by the hundreds were being erroneously accused of embezzling money due to the faults of the accounting system.</p> <p>The devolved administrations are expected to treat such convictions in Scotland and Northern Ireland in a similar fashion.</p> <p>There are 900 such cases in total, of which just 95 have been overturned so far in a court of appeal. Given the indication of support from Labour, Westminster is expected to enact legislation providing for this blanket exoneration by the end of the year.</p> <p>The upshot will be that the decisions of the courts will be overturned simply because MPs wish them to be so.</p> <p>Many moved by the horrific personal stories of those caught up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/07/what-is-the-post-office-horizon-it-scandal-all-about\">what has been described as the country’s greatest scandal</a> will be wholly supportive. But it is also a grave moment. It should not be equated with the granting of a pardon to the soldiers shot for cowardice in the first world war or those convicted over homosexual conduct in the armed forces.</p> <p>Those convictions were not expunged but disregarded. The state makes every effort to act as if such convictions did not happen but they do not disappear. It is after all for the courts, and not a government, to determine a person’s guilt. The crown does not have a prerogative of justice but only a prerogative of mercy.</p> <p>The announcement on Wednesday afternoon turns the constitutional order upside down.</p> <p>The government had few good options, said David McNeill, the director of public affairs at the Law Society, which had cautiously welcomed the announcement. But, he added, all those who cared about the rule of law needed to be deeply concerned.</p> <p>“Are we feeling queasy about it? Are we looking down with sort of queasy sense of vertigo? Yes, we are”, he said. “It breaches a fundamental principle which is effectively the government legislating against decisions, against the independence of the courts. These are exceptional circumstances, it is an extraordinary measure. It must not, must never be seen as a precedent.”</p> <p>What then are these extraordinary circumstances? There are the appalling failures, and indeed “malevolence”, as Hollinrake put it, of the Post Office’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/10/post-office-horizon-victims-tell-suffering-caused-by-scandal\">prosecution of innocent people</a> based on evidence many knew full well was not to be trusted. The courts did not have such evidence at the time.</p> <p>Then there is the fact that many convicted post office operators have been reluctant to apply to have their convictions overturned as they simply could not face further engagement with authority. Many are of an age where time is not on their side.</p> <p>But a big part of the explanation for why the government is legislating in such a way lies in the incapacity of the appeals process to deal with the sheer number of cases involved.</p> <p>The extraordinary circumstances, McNeill said, included the running down over many years of the level of resourcing in the criminal justice system, leaving it unable to fulfil its role.</p> <p>“Justice delayed is a denial of justice,” he said. “With the state of the courts at the moment, realistically, it can’t be adapted. It doesn’t have the capacity to deal with these hundreds of cases. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is already overwhelmed.</p> <p>“Every single court in the land, every single type of court is facing growing backlogs. There’s not enough judges, not enough court staff, not enough lawyers, to be able to progress just a normal caseload and then for the whole system then to have these hundreds of some quite complicated cases coming through, it does not have the capacity to do it. How many years it would take to deal with these cases through the normal system? Many, many years, maybe a decade or more.”</p> <p>Hollinrake described the decision to legislate rather than leave those convicted to the overwhelmed courts system as choosing a “lesser of two evils”. There will probably be some among those exonerated who may have been guilty of a crime. The only mitigation offered so far from the government to avoid that injustice is that those seeking compensation packages will need to sign a statement in which they state that they have not committed the crime.</p> <p>The concern for senior lawyers was, however, more about drawing a line in the sand, said McNeill. “Hollinrake was very clear in his statement in the house today that they recognise the constitutional principle, the line they are crossing and I think as the Law Society we would want to see a lot of that made explicit in debates in Hansard and potentially on the face of the bill,” he said. </p> <p>“It might sound very unlawyerly but they need to make those statements and do so with a shovel”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>House Republicans barreled ahead with their effort to impeach the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, for his handling of the US’s southern border, as their party attempts to make immigration a defining issue of this year’s presidential election.</p> <p>The House homeland security committee launched the impeachment proceedings on Wednesday, with Republicans charging that Mayorkas has been derelict in his duty to secure the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a> amid a sharp rise in migration while Democrats and administration officials assailed the inquiry as a “sham” and a “political stunt”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/new-york-mayor-lawsuit-bus-companies-sending-migrants-texas\">New York mayor sues bus operators that brought migrants from Texas for $708m </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is not a legitimate impeachment,” said Congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the panel. Echoing constitutional experts and conservative legal scholars, Thompson added: “You cannot impeach a cabinet secretary because you don’t like a president’s policy.”</p> <p>At Wednesday’s hearing, titled Havoc in the Heartland: How Secretary Mayorkas’ Failed Leadership Has Impacted the States, the panel’s chairman, Representative Mark Green, Republican of Tennessee, declared that he had a “duty” to pursue impeachment against Mayorkas, arguing in a combative closing statement that it was the appropriate punishment for the secretary’s “piss-poor performance” controlling the flow of migration and drugs into the US.</p> <p>He charged that Mayorkas, a former federal prosecutor, had “brazenly refused to enforce the laws passed by Congress” and has “enacted policies that knowingly make our country less safe”. As a result, Green said, Republicans were left with “no reasonable alternative than to pursue the possibility of impeachment”.</p> <p>The investigation into Mayorkas’s handling of the nation’s borders is being led by the House homeland security committee, as opposed to the House judiciary committee, which typically oversees impeachment proceedings but is presently consumed by Republicans’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/14/biden-impeachment-inquiry-explained-what-is-happening-and-could-the-president-be-convicted\">impeachment inquiry</a> into Joe Biden.</p> <p>If Republicans are successful, Mayorkas would be the first cabinet secretary impeached in <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/federal-impeachment/william-belknap#:~:text=During%20the%20pendency%20of%20the,the%20Senate%20in%20August%201876.\">nearly 150 years</a>.</p> <p>Yet across the Capitol, Mayorkas has emerged as a central figure in the bipartisan Senate negotiations over how to respond to the rise in migration at the US border with Mexico. It creates an odd juxtaposition in which House Republicans are trying to impeach an official with whom Senate Republicans are working to try to strike a border security deal.</p> <p>Record numbers of people are arriving at the southern US border each day, though crossings have recently fallen. The influx, as many as 10,000 arrivals on peak days, has strained border patrol resources as well as the public services in many cities and towns across the country.</p> <p>The situation at the US-Mexico border is an acute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/28/immigration-biden-trump-us-mexico-border\">political vulnerability</a> for the president, who has been unable to stem the flow of people from across the western hemisphere traveling north to escape violence, political upheaval, poverty and natural disasters.</p> <p>Unease among some House Republicans over their effort to impeach Biden despite a failure to uncover any evidence of misconduct has appeared to only strengthen the party’s appetite for bringing articles of impeachment against Mayorkas.</p> <p>In November, shortly after Republicans elected Mike Johnson as their new speaker after the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia attempted to force a snap impeachment of Mayorkas. Eight House Republicans joined with Democrats to block the effort, instead sending her resolution to the House homeland security committee.</p> <p>Now, as the problems at the border deepen and polling shows Republicans with a clear advantage on the issue of immigration and border security, some of those Republicans appear newly willing to support the impeachment effort.</p> <p>Green has indicated that he hopes to move quickly with the impeachment proceedings. But with their razor-thin majority, House Republicans would need near-total unanimity to levy articles of impeachment against Mayorkas.</p> <p>If the House impeaches Mayorkas, it is extremely unlikely two-thirds of the Senate, narrowly controlled by Democrats, would vote to convict him.</p> <p>Austin Knudsen, one of three Republican state attorneys general who testified before the panel on Wednesday, said Montana was on the frontline of the fentanyl crisis, accusing the Biden administration’s border policies of having “poured gasoline on this fire”.</p> <p>Knudsen, along with Gentner Drummond of Oklahoma and Andrew Bailey of Missouri heralded the hardline enforcement actions taken by Donald Trump and blamed the current challenges on Biden’s decisions to stop future construction of his predecessor’s border wall and end of Covid-19 era policy to swiftly expel migrants. (Several miles of the border wall have been built since Biden took office.) Trump, the Republican frontrunner for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination, has vowed even more draconian measures if he is elected to a second term.</p> <p>In her line of questioning on Wednesday, Greene, who sits on the homeland security panel, asked each Republican witness if he believed Mayorkas should be impeached. They agreed unequivocally that he should be.</p> <p>Representative Dan Goldman, a Democrat of New York who was the lead counsel in Trump’s first impeachment, scoffed at their determination, arguing that the attorneys general were not experts on the matter of impeachment and <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/attorney-general-bailey-files-suit-against-biden-administrations-unlawful-open-border-policies/\">all</a> had <a href=\"https://dojmt.gov/attorney-general-knudsen-sues-biden-administration-over-attempt-to-redefine-illegal-border-crossings-as-lawful-pathways/\">joined</a> a <a href=\"https://www.oag.ok.gov/articles/drummond-sues-biden-administration-over-unlawful-open-borders-policies\">lawsuit</a> suing the Biden administration over its border policies.</p> <p>“We have Republicans suing Secretary Mayorkas to stop him from implementing his policy to address the issues at the border. And now we’re going to impeach him because you say he’s not addressing the issues at the border,” Goldman said. “Which do you want?”</p> <p>Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri school of law and author of the book High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump who counts Bailey, the Missouri attorney general, as a former student, was the lone voice of dissent on the panel. He argued that Mayorkas’s conduct did not rise to level of “high crimes and misdemeanors”, far from it.</p> <p>“If the members of the committee disapprove of the Biden administration’s immigration and border policies, the constitution gives this Congress a wealth of legislative powers to change them,” he said. “Impeachment is not one of them.”</p> <p>During the hearing, Democrats readily acknowledged the challenges at the border, but said impeaching Mayorkas was not the solution. They implored Republicans to work with them to overhaul the nation’s outdated immigration system, expand work permits and increase funding for border agents.</p> <p>Representative Delia Ramirez, a Democrat of Illinois, said it was Republicans, not Democrats, who were failing to take the “humanitarian crisis within our borders seriously”.</p> <p>“Impeachment will not make our borders any safer for our communities or for asylum-seekers and it will not address the conditions across Latin America that motivate families to migrate across the jungles and deserts to our southern border,” she said.</p> <p>Several conservative lawmakers are unhappy with the direction of the bipartisan Senate talks, demanding Congress go further to restrict asylum laws. Some are threatening to block a funding bill and risk a government shutdown if Congress fails to take up Republicans’ hardline border security demands.</p> <p>Representative Anthony D’Esposito, a Republican of New York who represents a district carried by Biden in 2020, was emphatic that the proceedings were about accountability and not political theater. He cited comments by the Democratic leaders in his state who have pleaded for more federal help to deal with the migrant crisis in New York.</p> <p>“This isn’t a narrative,” he said. “It’s not one created by Republicans.”</p> <p>In a memo released ahead of the hearing, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) slammed the proceedings as a “baseless political attack” and a distraction from the efforts underway to find “real solutions” to fix the nation’s beleaguered immigration system.</p> <p>The agency highlighted comments made by Republican lawmakers and conservative legal scholars who disagreed that Mayorkas had committed impeachable offenses.</p> <p>And contrary to Republican claims of an “open” border, the DHS memo said that agents had removed or expelled more than 1 million individuals encountered at the border in both fiscal years 2022 and 2023, with more removals in 2022 than any previous year. It estimated that the annual rate of apprehensions under the Biden administration was 78%, “identical” to the rate under the Trump administration.</p> <p>They also noted increased efforts in stopping the flow of fentanyl, noting that the agency has “stopped <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2023/12/22/fact-sheet-dhs-front-lines-combating-illicit-opioids-including-fentanyl\">more fentanyl and arrested more individuals</a> for fentanyl-related crimes in the last two years than in the previous five years combined”.</p> <p>“This unprecedented process, led by extremists, is harmful to the Department and its workforce and undercuts vital work across countless national security priorities,” the memo said. “Unlike like those pursuing photo ops and politics, Secretary Mayorkas is working relentlessly to fix the problem by working with Republican and Democratic Senators to find common ground and real solutions.”</p>",

Conditions at the colony are notoriously tough and it is surrounded by mountains and tundra, with freezing dark winters making way for short, mosquito-infested summers.</p> \n<p>His abrupt and lengthy disappearance from the Melekhovo prison had raised concerns among supporters that he may have fallen ill or even died.</p> \n<p>In video from the prison, Navalny appeared gaunt with his head shaved, but nonetheless made fun of the party furore, asking Russian authorities if they had held a “normal party or a karaoke party”, prompting laughter from a judge, Reuters reported. His suit against prison authorities over his harsh conditions and disciplinary penalties was dismissed.</p> \n<p>Since the party on 21 December, Russian authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/28/russian-rapper-jailed-amid-backlash-over-almost-naked-party-at-moscow-nightclub\">have arrested and delivered a military summons to Nikolai Vasilyev</a>, a rapper known as Vacio, who attended wearing only a sock over his penis.</p> \n<p>Another singer, Maxim Tesli, the frontman of a band called Shchenki (The Puppies), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/second-russian-performer-detained-sock-penis-stunt\">was arrested trying to flee the country from St Petersburg airport</a> this week. He had appeared in concert with a sock over his penis in an apparent allusion to the scandal.</p> \n<p>Ivleeva, the party’s organiser, is facing jail time after authorities said they would launch an investigation for tax evasion.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the state-run Tass news agency reported that the popular Mutabor nightclub, which hosted the party, was shuttered for 90 days for “violations of sanitary standards”. The Russian sanitary watchdog reportedly had identified a “patient with an infectious disease” at the party.</p> \n<p>The backlash against those who attended the event, including some of Russia’s most popular entertainers, has highlighted the limits of the Kremlin’s strategy to let wealthy Russians in cities such as Moscow largely ignore the war, even as hundreds of thousands of soldiers have been killed since Putin launched the full-scale invasion in 2022.</p> \n<p>Some, including the Russian pop music veteran Philipp Kirkorov and publicist Ksenia Sobchak, have issued public apologies, while the Mutabor owner reportedly gave fragments of relics of Saint Nicholas to a Moscow church.</p> \n<p>The scandal comes as Putin increasingly parrots conservative talking points ahead of his reelection campaign, while also seeking to rally support for the war and convince ordinary Russians that the country’s economy is capable of withstanding economic isolation from the west.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A scandal as vast as the wrongful conviction of hundreds of innocent sub-postmasters is no single person’s fault, but it should plague many consciences. The government’s plan, announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/10/rishi-sunak-announces-plan-to-pass-law-quashing-horizon-post-office-scandal-convictions\">in parliament on Wednesday,</a> to exonerate all victims and expedite compensation is only the start of the reckoning.</p> <p>Labour, Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have all been in government over the long period when insufficient interest was taken in the case. Ministers accepted reassurances that should have been challenged. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/07/what-is-the-post-office-horizon-it-scandal-all-about\">malfunctioning IT system</a> was given more credence than evidence of an appalling miscarriage of justice, arguably the biggest in modern British legal history.</p> <p>In some cases, the offence may be limited to naivety or inattention. In others it might be callous indifference. But the greatest culpability is found in the pattern of deception and obstruction at the Post Office and opacity at Fujitsu, the company behind Horizon, the computer system at the root of so much misery.</p> <p>Answering questions about the scandal in the Commons on Wednesday, Kevin Hollinrake, minister for the Post Office, told MPs that a public inquiry under way has revealed evidence of “not only incompetence, but malevolence”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/10/post-office-horizon-victims-tell-suffering-caused-by-scandal\">Lives have been ruined</a>, and others have been lost to suicide, because of choices made to put profit and reputation, both corporate and personal, ahead of honesty, judgment and humanity.</p> <p>A moral failure so monumental has both institutional and individual origins. There are systems that need examination to understand how so many could be complicit in pursuing unsafe and unjust prosecutions for so long, to the point of vindictive extortion from people with no means to pay. Some of that will be a function of rigid hierarchies and fear of passing bad news up a chain of command. Some is mindless deference to the myth of digital infallibility.</p> <p>But injustice on such a scale also involves abuse of power; people withholding evidence or acting negligently to the point of criminal malfeasance. Exonerating and compensating the victims is one side of justice being seen to be done. The other comes when their tormentors are held to account.</p> <p>The ongoing <a href=\"https://www.postofficehorizoninquiry.org.uk/\">public inquiry</a> is a vital mechanism for establishing the facts, and that takes time. In these circumstances there is a tension between the imperative to act swiftly, especially when so much time has already been lost, and the requirement of diligence in ensuring that things are, at long last, done properly. There is no perfect balance. There is a risk, for example, that blanket quashing of all prosecutions lumps innocent victims together with those very few cases where fraud really was committed. Some sub-postmasters are uncomfortable with that association. But the more exhaustive process of case-by-case adjudication has already proved too slow.</p> <p>There will inevitably be questions raised about the adequacy and allocation of compensation, especially when previous settlements were depleted by legal costs. It is also reasonable to ask why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/08/post-office-it-fujitsu-profits-horizon-it-system\">Fujitsu</a> has contributed nothing to the pot of redress, while continuing to benefit from lucrative public contracts. Thus the UK taxpayer gets billed twice, paying for the Horizon failure and continuing to procure the services of its creator.</p> <p>A scandal of this magnitude has many aftershocks. The government was shaken into action on Wednesday. There are many who wanted the sub-postmasters’ story to blow over who should now feel the ground trembling under their feet.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The chair of the Welsh language public service broadcaster has been accused by MPs of acting as “judge, jury and executioner” and faces calls to be replaced after the dismissal of two female executives.</p> <p>In a letter to the culture secretary on Wednesday, the chair of the Welsh affairs committee, Stephen Crabb, recommended the removal of Rhodri Williams as the crisis at the top of S4C deepened.</p> <p>Writing to Lucy Frazer after a hearing, the Conservative MP said the committee was concerned about the ability of Williams to oversee the changes required and “given the importance of S4C and the scale of the challenges” they cited the “absence of cultural leadership at board level”.</p> <p>Williams had attempted to draw a line under the crisis, which culminated in the sacking of the former chief executive, Sian Doyle, in November after allegations of bullying. The committee hearing was postponed from 12 December after Doyle was hospitalised for a number of days after being found “unresponsive” by her husband.</p> <p>The chair of S4C, who will be reappointed or replaced at the end of his tenure in March, said an investigation revealed that Doyle had created a “culture of fear” at the broadcaster, which receives £89m in licence fee funding each year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/30/sacked-s4c-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-welsh-language-channel\">Sacked S4C chief calls for investigation into Welsh-language channel </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The report makes it very clear where the responsibility for that lies,” Williams told the committee. “And I don’t think it is with me, and I don’t think it is with the board. The report states very clearly that the chief executive at the time acted in a confrontational, abusive, and inconsiderate manner.”</p> <p>The report, commissioned by S4C after it received a letter of complaint about Doyle by the Bectu union in April last year, stated that the former CEO was “dictatorial [in] creating a culture of fear”, according to some of those giving evidence. It also criticised the chief content officer, Llinos Griffin-Williams, who was sacked after allegations of gross misconduct weeks before Doyle’s dismissal.</p> <p>After publication of the report Doyle said she did not “recognise or accept the allegations”, adding that she’d had no notice that the report would be published and had not been offered a right of reply by S4C.</p> <p>After her dismissal, Doyle wrote to Frazer calling on her to urgently investigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/s4c\">S4C</a> and its chair, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/30/sacked-s4c-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-welsh-language-channel\">told the Guardian</a> she had been “hung out to dry” by the organisation.</p> <p>Questioning Williams, the Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said the lack of right to reply for the two executives named in the report was “concerning”, adding: “I think it is normal practice, just as a matter of natural justice, that people are given a chance to challenge or to respond to such allegations.”</p> <p>Williams said that Griffin-Williams and Doyle were not given prior sight of the report because they were no longer employed by S4C. While S4C had also received legal advice about the dismissal of Doyle from Capital Law, there was a “Chinese wall” between the team undertaking the fact-finding exercise, and the different team providing advice, he said.</p> <p>Asked by Crabbif the report “draws a line under [the] episode” and if there were no “outstanding grievance or appeals processes in play relating to the dismissal of the two individuals?”, Williams responded: “No.” </p> <p>The Guardian understands that Griffin-Williams and Doyle have commenced legal action against the broadcaster on multiple grounds.</p> <p>Williams was also questioned about the sacking of Griffin-Williams, who had a bullying complaint about the chair upheld. He said her sacking was unrelated to the complaint and due to gross misconduct that occurred after a Welsh rugby match in Nantes. She denied gross misconduct and comments attributed to her and said she had been dismissed without a fair investigation.</p> <p>Crabb said: “As chair looks like you’ve been the judge and jury and executioner and Capital Law have provided you with the cover for it.”</p> <p>In his letter to Frazer, Crabb said the committee was “not satisfied by the assurances from Mr Williams […] that the different complaints made against specific individuals had been handled equitably and with proper consideration of the fair treatment of all those involved”.</p> <p>Williams, who began his tenure in April 2020 and will face further questions from the Welsh parliament on Thursday, also revealed that he had never met the culture secretary, to which Crabb replied: “Since your appointment as chair of S4C, you’ve not had a meeting with the secretary of state for culture, media and sport? I find that astounding.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>“All I know is that it’s time to leave this country, and go very far away.” Those words, from a staff member at the TV station <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/ecuador-tv-station-attack-workers\">attacked by masked gunmen</a> live on air on Tuesday, encapsulate the shock and despair that many in Ecuador now feel. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/ecuador-tv-studio-gang-attack-prison-break\">assault on TC Televisión</a> in Guayaquil, Ecuador’s most dangerous city, was one of multiple spectacular and coordinated attacks by gangs, in which at least 10 people were killed.</p> <p>Murderous crime has soared over recent years. But this was not just about gangs running rampant and battling each other with a sense of impunity, while brutalising anyone who got in their way. The invasion of a university and hospitals, the kidnapping and killing of police and prison guards, the torching of cars in residential areas, attacks in the Amazon region and looting in the capital, Quito – all these showed gangs operating well outside their usual fiefdoms, banding together, and turning on national institutions and civilians to try to force political leaders to back off. This strategic brutality, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ioangrillo/status/1744855686209823045\">has been described</a> as “violent lobbying”, has been used elsewhere in Latin America, but is new to Ecuador. For many, it feels as if the fate of the country itself is at stake.</p> <p>The explosion of violence was precipitated by the new and inexperienced president Daniel Noboa’s crackdown on organised crime, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/ecuador-adolfo-macias-fito-missing-gang-leader\">escape from prison</a> of the feared gang boss Adolfo Macías, known as Fito, and Mr Noboa’s declaration of a national state of emergency and curfew. The president said Ecuador was in “internal armed conflict”, designated 20 gangs as terrorist groups and said the military should “neutralise” them, albeit “within the bounds of international humanitarian law”.</p> <p>His campaign came in response to surging violence in a country once regarded as largely safe and stable. The homicide rate rose more than six-fold between 2018 and 2023, to <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-01-04/prison-ships-and-bukele-model-jails-in-ecuador-a-security-plan-adrift.html\">40 murders per 100,000</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/ecuador-presidential-candidate-fernando-villavicencio-killed\">assassination</a> last August of a presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, who had campaigned on a platform of tackling violence, crime and corruption, rocked the nation. This week marks a new nadir.</p> <p>Ecuador’s gangs have been transformed by their dealings with cartels and other transnational crime groups. The country sits between two cocaine-producing neighbours and has a long, porous coastline. The dollarised economy makes it easier to move and launder illicit earnings. Counter-drugs operations in other countries, and the disbanding of armed groups in Colombia, encouraged traffickers to look farther afield. Slashing spending on security in the past, due to IMF budget demands, didn’t help. And the insatiable appetite of consumers for cocaine – particularly in Europe, the most lucrative market – has fuelled the trade.</p> <p>Mr Noboa, who faces an election next year, so far has the public on his side. But Tuesday’s events show just how hard a struggle he faces in trying to rein in the gangs. There are also profound questions about his approach. He has announced that he has commissioned new maximum security and supermax prisons modelled on those used in El&nbsp;Salvador by its president, Nayib Bukele. Mr&nbsp;Bukele’s “iron fist” campaign against gangs has been wildly popular but tramples over rights, and is highly unlikely to prove sustainable. A true, <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/south-america/ecuadors-descent-chaos\">long-term solution</a> will be far harder to implement, requiring Ecuador to cooperate internationally on tackling organised crime and to make rigorous, well-planned, lasting efforts to tackle both corruption and poverty at home.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>Some have waited years, some decades, all of them united in their desperate search for justice.</p> <p>On Wednesday, post office operators hit by the Horizon IT scandal reacted with joy – and a degree of caution, mixed with frustration – as the government announced a blanket acquittal for the hundreds wrongly accused.</p> <p>Chris Head, a former post office operator, said the decision was “fabulous news” but added: “Why has it taken an outrage from the public, [so] that the government had no choice but to act? This story has been out there for 20 years. We could have had this dealt with well before now.”</p> <p>Lee Castleton, who was left bankrupt after a two-year legal battle with the Post Office, told the BBC the £75,000 compensation payment also announced by the government was “much appreciated … but I would just like to get to the end of this, really”.</p> <p>Tim Brentnall, who ran a Post Office in Pembrokeshire until an alleged £22,000 shortfall was discovered at his branch, was given an 18-month suspended sentence and ordered to do 200 hours of community service. </p> <p>He was eventually cleared in 2021. He said he hoped “words [would] translate into actions now”.</p> <p>“This is what we’ve been calling for, the quashing of all convictions – the government to legislate for it, to move it on,” he said. “It has been two and a half years since my conviction was quashed and nothing has really happened for me in that two and a half years.”</p> <p>The announcement from Rishi Sunak came amid a wave of increased public outrage, triggered in part by an ITV dramatisation about the miscarriage of justice, Mr Bates vs the Post Office. </p> <p>The series tells the stories of some of those who were wrongly convicted or accused of offences such as fraud, theft and false accounting because of a faulty IT system called Horizon.</p>    <p>About 700 post office operators were prosecuted between 1999 and 2015, with some going to prison.</p> <p>Alan Bates, the man who became the title character of the ITV drama and who ran a post office in the seaside town of Llandudno, north Wales, told the BBC that more work was needed to ensure those affected by the scandal received adequate compensation.</p> <p>The government has offered £75,000 upfront, but Bates said those with claims higher than that amount also needed their cases addressed. “They’ve lost their houses, their businesses, their earning capacity,” he said.</p> <p>The 68-year-old welcomed the government’s blanket acquittal plan, but added: “The devil is in the detail, and we’ve yet to see that. We’re still going to have to keep pushing the issue forward.”</p> <p>Legal representatives of post office operators also warned the government against giving “false hope”.</p> <p>Neil Hudgell, of Hudgell Solicitors, which represents a number of post office operators, said: “We very much welcome the government’s pledge to exonerate and compensate all the innocent victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal.</p> <p>“Whilst some of the pledges appear hugely positive, the finer detail of how this will be achieved is key.</p> <p>“Having supported subpostmasters for the past three and a half years, we have seen how this scandal has impacted on each and every victim, and their wider families, in different ways, and how it continues to impact on them today.</p> <p>“We must be careful not to give them false hope from political promises, only for them to be let down again.”</p> <p>James Hartley, the lawyer who represented the so-called “555” operators in their first legal action against the Post Office, said the compensation announcement was “a sensible step forward”.</p> <p>Hartley said it would also give post office operators the option to decide “whether or not to accept that payment as fair compensation”. </p> <p>“Our focus remains on driving forward all the compensation claims as quickly as possible,” he added.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>As someone responsible for Labour’s catastrophic defeat in December 2019, which has enabled the Tories to inflict chaos on our society and harm on the most vulnerable people for the last four years, John McDonnell has some brass neck to be lecturing Keir Starmer on&nbsp;how to win an election.</p> <p>He began his article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/04/keir-starmer-underestimate-nigel-farage-reform-uk\">Starmer must say what he’ll do in power – if he leaves a vacuum, the far right will fill it, 4 January</a>) disingenuously, by insinuating that Labour’s current popularity over the Tories is “part of a natural cycle”, rather than what is in fact an astonishing comeback, due in no small measure to Starmer’s efforts to expose the Tories’ unfitness for government.</p> <p>It may escape McDonnell, but it would make sense to me if Starmer’s giving away “very little, or any, detail on what he will do in office” was a strategy to prevent the Tories from helping themselves to what they wanted from Labour’s policies while misrepresenting the remainder of them to the electorate via the front pages of the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>Starmer admires Harold Wilson, who – within five years of being elected in 1964, after 13 years of Tory rule – abolished capital punishment and legalised both abortion and homosexuality, none of which had been in <a href=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1964/1964-labour-manifesto.shtml\">Labour’s election manifesto</a> nor required lavish public spending, but helped to make our country kinder and more just.</p> <p>Personally, I credit Starmer for his impressive work so far and trust him to know how to win an election and use power once in office.<br><strong>Martin Wallace</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• John McDonnell is spot-on about the far right filling the vacuum if Labour cannot deliver the change the country needs and expects. While it is understandable that Labour does not wish to give any hostages to fortune, it seems to have just submitted to the establishment and made it very hard for people who think about the political direction of this country to work out&nbsp;what its basic principles are.</p> <p>New Labour – pre-Iraq – was exciting, with some great ideas. The message of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves seems to be that Labour will implement Tory policies more competently. They are still allowing the Tories to set the agenda. A paler version of Tory policies by a new Labour government will end in disillusionment and failure, and open the door to the far-right fraudsters and racists who are on the rise in Europe.<br><strong>Aziz Rajab-Ali</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• There is little point in trying to second guess how the Conservative party sees its relationship from week to week with Reform UK and other far-right factions, but John McDonnell’s analysis deserves to be taken seriously, whatever his past political history and reputation within the Labour party. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens should have no problems with his warnings. </p> <p>But if, on this occasion, McDonnell sounds like the voice of sanity then Labour – and, consequently, the rest of us – are in serious trouble. Majoring on telling Conservative and former Conservative voters that Labour is a changed party does not capture the imagination of millions of people who want leaders to stand firmly against extremist rightwing parties, and stop them getting anywhere near political power.<br><strong>Geoff Reid</strong><br><em>Bradford</em></p> <p>• John McDonnell makes some important points. I will demur from pointing out that under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, McDonnell failed to convince the electorate that he could manage the economy, and the result was four further years of very rightwing&nbsp;policies&nbsp;and&nbsp;chaos.</p> <p>Starmer is correct to focus on getting into No 10 with a middle-of-the-road plan and a commitment to clean up politics. The electorate knows that it will take more than five years to correct the disasters of&nbsp;the previous 14 years.<br><strong>Tim Smart</strong><br><em>Fleet, Hampshire </em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

With a particular focus on the 18th century, the finds reveal their tastes, habits and interests; how fashion, the expanding empire, the impact of slavery and the growth of the consumer economy at home touched real people in Wells.</p> <p>The collection remained untapped and largely unseen until the dedication of volunteers and seed funding from Arts Council England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund instigated a programme of research and community activity, culminating in the exhibition Smashed in the Cellar. We are all the poorer if small, largely volunteer-funded museums such as Wells, as well as our larger public institutions, are starved of the support received from local and national government. Funding from charitable trusts and the agencies that distribute Lottery funding is ever more oversubscribed.

This clearly illustrated and communicated children’s frustrations with schooling. They wanted beautiful and comfortable school buildings; a diverse, practical and relevant curriculum; time and space to think; and they wanted to be respected and listened to.</p> <p>Ten years later, the paper repeated the exercise and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/03/school-i-would-like-childrens-manifesto\">results</a> were very much the same. The pandemic has, we are told, changed attitudes towards schooling.

            "body" : "<p>Handing back a CBE costs nothing, financially speaking. So it is little wonder that Paula Vennells, former chief executive of the Post Office, has discovered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/former-post-office-boss-paula-vennells-to-return-cbe-amid-horizon-scandal\">returning her absurd award</a> has prompted another question. Yes, but what about your bonuses?</p> <p>The demand is obviously fair. And, critically, it is fair even according to the rules of the bonus scheme that operated during her seven years at the top from 2012 and 2019. Both the short-term incentive plan (STIP) and long-term (LTIP) at the Post Office clearly stated that there could be situations in which bonuses could be cancelled and individuals told to return cash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/10/key-horizon-campaigner-says-more-needs-to-be-done-over-post-office-scandal\">Key Horizon campaigner says more needs to be done over Post Office scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This wording is from the Post Office’s <a href=\"https://clarotesting.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/2013-pol-annual-report-accounts.pdf\">2012-13 accounts</a> (page 52) and near-identical versions can be found in every subsequent year of Vennells’s tenure: “Executive directors have clawback clauses in their contracts, as well as the STIP and LTIP rules, which provide for the return of any overpayments in the event of misstatement of the accounts, error or gross misconduct on the part of an executive. These provisions are in line with market best practice.”</p> <p>Any debate about a watertight definition of “gross misconduct” shouldn’t detain the lawyers too long on this occasion. Despite a report in 2012 from external reviewers that the Horizon IT system was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/post-office-horizon-it-scandal-paula-vennells-cbe\">“not fit for purpose”</a>, the Post Office continued prosecutions until 2015 and then spent millions of pounds defending itself until the damning high court judgment in 2019.</p> <p>Vennells’s incentive payments add up to £2.2m over the course of her time in charge. She may note that when James Crosby, former boss of HBOS, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/09/former-hbos-chief-statement-knighthood-pension-full-text\">gave up his knighthood in 2013</a> after a parliamentary committee found he “sowed the seeds” of destruction at the bank, he volunteered to surrender 30% of his pension entitlement. Those were the days before clawback clauses but Crosby was nodding to the principle that giving up a gong is not enough. In a post-clawback world, matters should be simpler: the rules are meant to insist on repayment of bonuses. If the relevant clauses aren’t triggered in Vennells’s case, when would they be?</p> <p>None of which is to deny that the rotten saga goes further than her. The politicians with oversight roles of the state-owned Post Office clearly have questions to answer, as do the relevant executives at Fujitsu, supplier of the dodgy IT software. But, among the business crew at the top of the Post Office over the years, the two chairs during Vennells’s time must explain why they backed the executives to the hilt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Part of the job of a chair is meant to be about challenging groupthink and confirmation bias and spotting when an organisation may have got something spectacularly wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>The individuals in this case were Alice Perkins (2011-15) and Tim Parker (2015-22).</p> <p>But the inquiry also needs to go further back to the pre-Vennells period when the prosecutions started. “I did not have any involvement in the Horizon issue during my time at Royal Mail,” said BT Group chair Adam Crozier, who was chief executive from 2003 to 2010 of the pre-demerged entity that managed Royal Mail and the Post Office, this week.</p> <p>That statement reads like a variation on “don’t blame me, I was only the boss”. But, if it’s really the case that the Post Office was left to do its own thing within the wider Royal Mail organisation, then the question is who was supposed to be accountable for the biggest IT project in Europe at the time? Was Allan Leighton, chair of Royal Mail during Crozier’s time, supposed to have an eye on both operations? Or should the inquiry first be hearing from the likes of Alan Cook, later chair of insurer LV= but managing director of the Post Office from 2006 to 2010? If in doubt, summon the lot. It is important that some fuller version of boardroom accountability is established.</p> <p>But retrieving Vennells’s bonuses ought to be straightforward. If he’s doing his job, Henry Staunton, today’s chair of the Post Office, should be on the case already.</p>",

They eventually were able to get into the house via an unsecured bedroom window and described the interior to be “extremely hot”.</p> <p>Upon entering the bedroom, police discovered the dead couple. The man was found lying on the bed unclothed and facing upwards while the woman was at the side of the bed, clothed and slouched in a chair. Authorities did not observe signs of struggle, foul play or carbon monoxide poisoning. They added that fire officials measured the carbon dioxide levels in the house which were “not at a concerning level”.</p> <p>Medics measured the couple’s bodies with a device that only registered temperatures up to 106F (41C), according to the police report. Both victims’ temperatures exceeded 106F. The report added that fire officials measured the house’s interior temperature and found it to exceed 120F (48.9C), despite the house being open for 20 minutes to the cold weather.</p> <p>Authorities also checked the basement where the heater and hot water heater were located and discovered that the “heater was so hot it looked as if the basement was currently on fire”, according to one firefighter. After deactivating the heater, authorities measured its temperature and found it to be “over 1,000 degrees”, the police report said.</p> <p>It added that fire officials continued to air out the residence “due to the strong odor of natural gas”.</p> <p>Family members were at the couple’s house last Wednesday helping them with their heater. The family reportedly told authorities that both the house’s heater and hot water heater were out and that the house was getting too cold. They noticed that the hot water heater’s pilot light was out and started “fiddling” with it, moving a wire and it eventually turned on. Once the light turned back on, the family members left the residence.</p> <p>The police report stated that after not hearing from their parents for several days, the family members became concerned. They told authorities that their parents had several health issues and were not easily mobile, adding that the man fell recently while the woman had a hip surgery.</p> <p>The couple has been identified by the Spartanburg county coroner’s office as 84-year old Joan Littlejohn and 82-year old Glennwood Fowler.</p> <p>“We … are concerned with why the temperature was so high,” the Spartanburg county coroner, Rusty Clevenger, said in a statement provided to the Guardian.</p> <p>“We followed through with forensic exams this morning that will require more testing. CO2 is one test as it was mentioned in the police report. We will continue to investigate. We ask you keep the families of Ms Littlejohn and Mr Fowler in your thoughts and prayers during their time of loss and grief,” he added.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>At times like these, we would do well to remember the real heroes in the whole sorry business. Not the little people – men and women such as Alan Bates and the other operators who have pursued the Post Office and Fujitsu relentlessly for the best part of 25 years. Nor the lawyers who fought their cases through the courts. But the MPs who have managed to convince themselves that they are the ones who have made the difference, without whom justice would still be denied.</p> \n<p>We’re not talking of the few genuine MPs here. The former Conservative MP Lord Arbuthnot, who appeared rather bemused as he followed Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions and the subsequent urgent question from the gallery. Nor Labour’s Kevan Jones and Darren Jones, who have also tenaciously got stuck in. Rather we’re thinking of the vast majority who have only newly remembered just how much they always cared. The unsung legends of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/10/key-horizon-campaigner-says-more-needs-to-be-done-over-post-office-scandal\">the Horizon scandal</a>.</p> \n<p>Take Priti Patel. She had taken her place on the back row of the government benches ready to receive the undying gratitude of her colleagues. Since last week’s ITV drama, she has rather invented herself as the champion of the underdog. While it’s true she was one of the first to mention the miscarriage of justice in parliament back in 2010, she has gone rather quiet since. She never used her position as home secretary to the post office operators’ advantage and she did accept an invitation to speak at a Fujitsu conference. Amnesia, I guess.</p> \n<p>Then we have Nadhim Zahawi, fresh from playing himself in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/post-office-scandal-tv-drama-horizon\">ITV’s Mr Bates vs The Post Office</a>. He too was in the Commons to take a victory lap for all his hard work. To see his call for a group pardon granted. Mmm. Just remember this was the former chancellor who was sacked for breaking the ministerial code after being found to have tried to pay less tax than he owed. Get your head round that. A tax dodger speaking out on behalf of people falsely accused of being on the take. Only in Westminster.</p> \n<p>These are just a couple. There are many – oh so many – of others to be found in all parties and in all corners of the Commons. The quiet ones. The ones who could never be arsed to turn up to any of the UQs or ministerial statements. Who never quite saw what the fuss was all about, nor worried that efforts to overturn convictions and award compensation were taking place at glacial speed. Until last week. At which point they morphed into dogged pursuers of the truth.</p> \n<p>There were also some in-betweeners. Step forward Lee Anderson’s favourite Tory MP, Lee Anderson. Back in February 2022, Lee spoke for 20 seconds during a UQ about a wrongly accused post office operator in his Ashfield constituency. Since then, according to the official record of parliamentary debates, he has said nothing on the subject. Nor was he inclined to remain in the Commons after PMQs for the UQ in which the junior business minister, Kevin Hollinrake, would update the house on overturning convictions en masse. Poor Lee. Suffering from compassion fatigue. Again. It happens so much to him. He just can’t stop caring.</p> \n<p>But all this is more than enough for Anderson to be recognised as a total legend in Westminster. A member of the ranks of the “tireless campaigners” who have spoken at least once during the 25-year scandal. Where would the post office operators have been without him? So Lee took it upon himself to make one last effort at the start of PMQs. To speak on behalf of all the other tireless campaigners in the Tory ranks.</p> \n<p>What Anderson wanted. No. What Anderson demanded was that Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader who remarkably hadn’t been able to make it to this week’s PMQs – so, so sorry, absolutely gutted – to resign. Or be made to resign. To clear off. He could never be forgiven for the way he had treated the post office operators during his two-year stint as Post Office minister during the early days of the coalition.</p> \n<p>Lee should be careful what he wishes for. Politicising Horizon is a zero sum game. Because for all the “tireless campaigners” there are dozens of other MPs – most of whom are in his own party – who also have their guilty secrets. Ranging from those whose mere lack of interest and inertia enabled the saga to drag on for years longer than it should have, to those more actively involved and compromised. Their culpability over exposed.</p> \n<p>Rishi Sunak had clearly decided discretion was the better part of valour. He ignored the calls for Davey’s resignation, choosing instead to leak Hollinrake’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/10/rishi-sunak-announces-plan-to-pass-law-quashing-horizon-post-office-scandal-convictions\">announcement half an hour early</a> and to lament the situation in general. Just as well, perhaps. As prime minister he had never shown any interest in the scandal and as chancellor he had given Fujitsu a further £4.9bn in contracts. That’s after Fujitsu were found to have actively concealed the faults in their own software and had shifted the blame to the innocent. Nice work for Fujitsu if you can get it.</p> \n<p>After his own hymn to Horizon, Keir Starmer also dropped the subject. He too is facing questions as to why he didn’t intervene in the handful of prosecutions brought by the CPS. But in any case, there was much more fun to be had by him tormenting Sunak with his general levels of hopelessness. Starting with the recent revelation that Rish! had wanted to scrap the Rwanda scheme during his leadership bid in 2022. Not from a moral point of view – obvs, Sunak doesn’t have principles – but because it wasn’t value for money. It didn’t work.</p> \n<p>Rish! burbled and got tetchy, pretending not to listen while Starmer mocked him with phrases like “Mr Nobody”. Of course he did. Because that’s what he always does. He didn’t deny the claims, just insisted they must have happened to another Rishi Sunak, before going on to say the country had never been in better shape. Everything was going terribly well, thanks to him. My Thousand-Year Plan.</p> \n<p>Labour had nothing but empty slogans, he insisted, before mindlessly repeating his own slogan about Starmer returning the country to square one. Please! Bring it on. Square one is dreamland compared to where we are now. Sunak just looked beaten. Being humiliated is getting to be a habit. Even his most loyal colleagues can barely bring themselves to look him in the eye.</p> \n<p>That just left time for the SNP’s Stephen Flynn to insist that Horizon couldn’t have happened north of the border if Scotland had voted for independence. Those with glass motorhomes shouldn’t throw stones … Still, at least everyone could agree that they had all done their best. Repressed self-congratulation was the order of the day. Alan Bates might see it differently.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>John Crace’s book Depraved New World (Guardian Faber, £16.99) is out now.

Here is a chart from a <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/UKICE-The-State-of-Public-Opinion-2023-2-.pdf\">UK in a Changing Europe report</a> on public opinion published last month that shows Labour leading on the economy, law and order, the NHS, education, housing and immigration. On other mainstream issues, Labour would be ahead too.</p> \n  <p>But today it has emerged that the Conservatives have a lead on at least one issue, and it is a surprising one. <a href=\"https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/documents/Results_MAP_231221_W.pdf\">YouGov polling</a> commissioned by Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and the <strong>Council for Arab-British Understanding</strong> (Caabu) shows that people think the government’s handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been better than Labour’s.</p> \n  <p>Asked about the government’s handling of the conflict, 17% of respondents said they approved and 29% said they disapproved – a net score of –12.</p> \n  <p>But, asked about Labour’s handling of the conflict, only 9% said they approved and 30% said they disapproved – a net score of -21.</p> \n  <p>This is surprising in some respects because, in terms of what they have said about the conflict, it is very hard to differentiate between the UK government’s position and the shadow cabinet’s. The poll, which also found 71% of people in favour of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and only 12% opposed, seems to have been commissioned with the intention of showing that both main parties are out of touch with public opinion. The Tories and Labour have both avoided calling for an immediate ceasefire, advocating humanitarian pauses instead.</p> \n  <p>As for why the figures for the two parties are so different, there are probably three main explanations.</p> \n  <p>First, the figures reflect the fact that Tory-leaning voters are more likely to say they back the government’s approach (30%) but not to say they back Labour’s approach (8%). Labour-leaning voters, on this issue at least, are a bit less tribal. Some 47% of them disapprove of the government’s approach, but 35% of them disapprove of Labour’s too.</p> \n  <p>Second, Keir Starmer has faced at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/nov/15/rwanda-deportation-policy-supreme-court-rishi-sunak-leadership-conservatives-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-65551d048f088603929f2737#block-65551d048f088603929f2737\">eight frontbench resignations</a> over his Gaza policy, and dozens more at councillor level. For many respondents, that must compound the perception that his response has been problematic.</p> \n  <p>And, third, YouGov asked about the government’s handling of the conflict, not the Conservative party’s. The results might have been different if the Tories had been mentioned in the question because their reputation is so toxic.</p> \n  <p>Chris Doyle, the director of Caabu, said the findings should be a wake-up call. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This poll shows a total and utter lack of public confidence in the way both the UK government and the Labour party have handled this. The figures could hardly be lower. This should be a wake-up call to the political leaderships to realign themselves both with public sentiment, international law and the need to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T17:32:54.608Z\">at 5.32pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-659eb2b18f08dedeb88aeabd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T15:34:20.125Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-659eb1a88f08dedeb88aeaa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T15:07:20.346Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/01/09/horizon-expert-gareth-jenkins-post-office-inquiry-immunity/\">its splash</a> on the Post Office Horizon scandal this morning the Daily Telegraph said that at least 27 of the prosecutions were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service, not the Post Office, “raising serious questions about whether Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, oversaw a number of wrongful convictions during his five-year tenure as director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013”.</p> \n  <p>At Labour’s post-PMQs briefing, a spokesperson for Keir Starmer said Starmer was not aware of these cases when he was DPP.

Keir Starmer left Sunak bouncing off the ropes after one of his most comprehensive PMQs goings-over probably ever.</p> \n  <p>Arguments work well at PMQs, but nothing is more deadly than ridicule. Gordon Brown’s reputation was never quite the same after Vince Cable described him as going “from Stalin to Mr Bean” and at times Starmer’s withering descriptions of the PM were laugh-out-loud funny. At one point Labour was wary of attacking Sunak over immigration, traditionally a Tory issue, but increasingly Labour is taking the view that the Rwanda scheme is a policy albatross. It was telling that Sunak could not convincingly deny originally having doubts about the idea. Starmer has repeatedly denounced Sunak as out of touch, but today the accusations sounded more plausible than ever. And Sunak was strikingly short on retaliatory material.

The essential function of the police is to uphold the law. I am concerned that resources which might otherwise have been allocated to dealing with thefts, robberies and assaults are giving way to other activities.

PA says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the right wing of the Conservative party gears up for a parliamentary battle, the prime minister was warned by the former immigration minister <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> that the plan “simply doesn’t work” in its current form.</p> \n   <p>Dozens of rightwing Conservatives are backing amendments to the safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill aimed at effectively ignoring international law and to severely limit individual migrants’ ability to resist being put on a flight to Kigali.</p> \n   <p>Jenrick refused to say whether he would vote for the legislation if it were not rewritten.</p> \n   <p>“This is the third piece of legislation in three years. It’s three strikes or you’re out, we’ve got to get this right,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today this morning.</p> \n   <p>The measures Jenrick and his allies are pushing would end what he called the “merry-go-round of individual claims whereby illegal migrants claim every possible defence in order to frustrate their removal to Rwanda” and would prevent flights being grounded by emergency injunctions from the European court of human rights.</p> \n   <p>The government’s bill and a treaty with Rwanda are intended to make the scheme legally watertight following a supreme court ruling against the plan.</p> \n   <p>But Jenrick said: “[The] government’s reported legal advice is that the bill has a 50% chance at best of getting a single flight off to Rwanda before the general election. When the stakes are so high for the country I don’t think that’s acceptable. We need to make sure it’s much more rigorous than that.”</p> \n   <p>Jenrick said the amendments aimed at toughening up the Rwanda bill were in line with international law, one of the tests set by Sunak for any changes as the Kigali government has warned the deal could fall apart if the UK breaks international conventions.</p> \n   <p>Former home secretary <strong>Suella Braverman</strong>, who backs the changes put forward by Jenrick and Sir Bill Cash, said: “To not adopt these amendments, and introduce another failing bill, will be a betrayal of the British people.”</p> \n   <p>Writing in the Daily Mail, she said: “As drafted, this bill will not stop the boats. The government’s own lawyers have also reportedly advised that the scheme, as currently laid out, is fundamentally flawed.

Normally when a junior minister does the morning interview round they end up being asked topics about which they know not much more than you or me, but today the interviews were a bit more illuminating than normal. Hollinrake is minister for postal services, and so he is well briefed on the story of the day, but he is also an MP who was taking an interest in the Post Office Horizon scandal even before he joined the government.</p> \n  <p>Rishi Sunak is taking PMQs at noon and, after Alex Chalk, the justice secretary, told MPs yesterday that an announcement about a possible move to quash all the unsafe Post Office convictions in one go might be coming soon, there is intense speculation that Sunak will unveil the news in the chamber. Prime ministers always like to be identified with “good” government announcements, and having a “story” like this up your sleeve is a very useful defence mechanism at PMQs. In his interviews Hollinrake did not confirm that the announcement would come today, but he said it was “very, very close”.</p> \n  <p>He also claimed that this was not soley a response to the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which propelled this long-running scandal to the very top of the news agenda. In an interview on the Today programme, when <strong>Justin Webb</strong> put it to him that the government was previously not interested in a blanket move quashing all these unsafe convictions, and that “the only thing that has changed is the ITV drama”, <strong>Hollinrake</strong> replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Not true. We’ve been looking at this for some time. The advisory board we work closely with is very engaged in this. We’ve been dissatisfied with a number of people have come forward trying to overturn those convictions. So this has been something we’ve been deliberating for some time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hollinrake was referring to the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board. This is due to meet today at 1.30pm, and that may be one factor that prevents a PMQs announcement, because the government will want to have its approval for whatever it announces.</p> \n  <p>In his Today interview Hollinrake said he welcomed the decision by Paula Vennells, the former Post Office boss, to hand back her CBE. But he could not explain why she was given the award in 2019, when a great deal was already known about the unsafe conditions. Hollinrake said giving her the CBE in the first place “was a mistake”.</p> \n  <p>Vennells is now under pressure to give back the bonuses she received for her work as head of the Post Office. The Daily Mail has splashed on this idea approvingly.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1744849184568573975\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MAIL: Now give back your millions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VBl3KdrTpI\">pic.twitter.com/VBl3KdrTpI</a></p>— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1744849184568573975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2024</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Hollinrake did not support calls for Vennells to have to return bonus payments – or at least not now. He told Today:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One thing we should not have is trial by media. I think we should let the inquiry run its course. It should report and identify individuals and organisations responsible. At that point in time then sanctions can be placed on those individuals.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>10.30am</em>: Chris Philp, the policing minister, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the impact of police commissioners.</p> \n  <p><em>10.30am:</em> Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, gives evidence to the Commons business committee about investment zones and freeports.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm:</em> Rishi Sunak faces Keir Starmer at PMQs.</p> \n  <p><em>2.15pm:</em> Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.</p> \n  <p><em>3pm:</em> Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, and other experts give evidence to the joint committee on human rights on the Rwanda bill.</p> \n  <p>If you want to contact me, do try the “send us a message” feature.

I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T09:47:53.210Z\">at 9.47am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

There’s an alarming gap here between what the public wants and what state lawmakers have delivered.”</p> <p>Only six states, plus the District of Columbia, have tax systems that reduce inequality rather than worsen it, with the poorest fifth of people paying a tax rate 60% higher, on average, than the top 1% of households.</p> <p>The super-wealthy are treated particularly lightly by the tax system, with the top 1% paying less than every other income group across 42 states. In most states, 36 in all, the poorest residents are taxed at a higher rate than any other group.</p> <p>The most regressive states in terms of taxation are, in order, Florida, Washington, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Nevada. The least regressive jurisdictions are DC, Minnesota, Vermont, New York and California.</p> <p>Various state-level policies, such as cutting taxes on the wealthy to supposedly drive economic activity, has worsened this situation, the report found. Inequality in recent decades has been far starker in the US than in other comparable countries and while some pandemic-era interventions, such as increased child tax credit, lessened the burden on the poorest in society, many of those measures have now lapsed.</p> <p>“But we know it doesn’t have to be like this,” said Aidan Davis, ITEP’s state policy director.</p> <p>“There is a clear path forward for flipping upside-down tax systems and we’ve seen a handful of states come pretty close to pulling it off. The regressive state tax laws we see today are a policy choice, and it’s clear there are better choices available to lawmakers.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 11 and 12 January 2024. Owing to incorrect information supplied to us, an earlier version listed New Jersey as the fifth least regressive tax jurisdiction, according to the ITEP report, rather than California. Also, child tax credit was increased during the pandemic, not introduced then as an earlier version said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My cousin Graham Pearson, who has died aged 88, was a research chemist and then a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence, serving from 1984 until 1995 as director general of what is now the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire.</p> <p>Arising from a growing interest in arms control, which led him while still in post to work on verification methods to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention, in 1996 he joined Bradford University’s Department of Peace Studies as an honorary visiting research fellow in international security. His skills as an organiser, analyser and writer, helped by his boundless energy and genial personality, involved him in numerous meetings designed to strengthen the BWC, including in Geneva during Pugwash conferences on science and world affairs. He published widely in the field of chemical and biological weapons. Subsequently a visiting professor, he was made a DUniv of Bradford in 2018.</p> <p>He was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, the only child of Reg Pearson, a textile manufacturer, and his wife, Alice (nee Maclachlan). Graham was born almost completely deaf, but he determinedly overcame this disability, partly through a mastery of lip-reading. He was educated at Woodhouse Grove school and the University of St Andrews, where he read chemistry, staying on for his doctorate.</p> <p>It was there, while playing badminton, that he met his future wife, Susan Benn, a modern languages student. They married in 1960, departing immediately for the US, where Graham had been awarded a research fellowship at the University of Rochester. In their ’56 Chevrolet station wagon they embarked on an 11,000-mile camping trip before returning home in 1962.</p> <p>Graham then joined the scientific civil service. Placed initially with the MoD’s Rocket Propulsion Establishment, he continued to specialise in this area of defence research and development. A highlight was his three-year posting, in the same capacity, to the British embassy in Washington (1969-72), for which Susan and their two small sons accompanied him.</p> <p>Moving into administration, from 1980 to 1983 he was deputy director of the Research Development Establishment at Fort Halstead, near Sevenoaks in Kent. During his final post, at Porton Down, he was appointed CB in 1990.</p> <p>Following a move from Wiltshire to Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds in 2001, Graham brought the same energy and dedication to his 20 years of voluntary work at the National Trust garden at Hidcote Manor. Not content with being a garden guide, he set about uncovering Hidcote’s history and the life of its founder, Lawrence Johnston, travelling extensively to work on archival sources. Two books resulted, including the profusely illustrated Hidcote: The Garden and Lawrence Johnston (2007).</p> <p>Graham is survived by Susan, his sons, Gavin and Douglas, and five grandchildren.</p>",

He went to AJ Dawson grammar school in Co Durham and then completed a history degree at Liverpool University, before becoming a primary school teacher at Croxteth school in Liverpool in 1976.</p> <p>After spells at Carr Lane and Broadgreen schools in the city, he joined Liverpool city council’s education department, where he came up with the idea of the Liverpool Schools’ Parliament. Once it was given the go-ahead, he became responsible for setting up and running it, and until his retirement in 2019 was its director.</p> <p>He and I met in 2013, when I was a pupil taking part in the parliament’s deliberations, and I was immediately impressed by his commitment to giving young people a voice, engaging them in decision making and helping them to become informed citizens. He did this all while never sharing his opinions, instead encouraging those he worked with to form their own views.</p> <p>Aside from his work with the council, in his spare time Jeff volunteered as a trustee of several charities, including the <a href=\"https://michaelcauser.co.uk/\">Michael Causer Foundation</a>, a charity for young LGBT people.</p> <p>Despite encouraging many young people to extraordinary heights, he usually remained in the background and his efforts often went unrecognised, although in 2020 he became a <a href=\"https://www.liverpooltownhall.co.uk/citizens-of-honour/#:~:text=The%20Citizen%20of%20Honour%20of,City%20and%2For%20its%20citizens.\">Citizen of Honour of the City of Liverpool</a>.</p> <p>His legacy lives on through all of the remarkable things that the children he inspired are now doing as adults.</p> <p>He is survived by his sister, Glynis.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My husband, Stuart Walker, who has died aged 91, was an award-winning production designer in film and television in a career that spanned 50 years, the first 30 at the BBC and then working freelance. </p> <p>His BBC career started in 1959 in Schools Television and by 1968 he had become a senior designer in the BBC design department. He enjoyed working collaboratively with many of the leading directors and producers of the day, balancing design requirements with imaginative visual solutions, resulting in sets created for the studio and on location. He worked on productions ranging from Doctor Who to Shakespeare, classic drama series and contemporary single plays.</p> <p>He won two Baftas, both for BBC work. The first, in 1983, was for his design for the television film An Englishman Abroad, written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanbennett\">Alan Bennett</a> and directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/26/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">John Schlesinger</a>, for which Stuart turned Dundee into a snowy and totally convincing 1950s Moscow. His second was for Portrait of a Marriage (1990), a lavish period drama series based on the book by Nigel Nicolson about the marriage of his parents Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson, and set in Edwardian England and France. He was nominated for a third Bafta in 1994 for Scarlet and Black, set in 19th-century France.</p> <p>In 1988 his extraordinary bleak and expressionistic designs for Road, a film in BBC Two’s ScreenPlay anthology series written by Jim Cartwright, directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/08/1\">Alan Clarke</a> and set in a deprived working-class area of Lancashire in 1980s Britain, won him a Royal Television Society award. </p> <p>Stuart was born in Manchester to William, a salesman, and his wife, Annie (nee Jackson), an accounts clerk. He had a younger sister, Shirley. With his father away during the second world war, the family moved to Blackpool, where at 13 he went to Blackpool junior art school, subsequently studying at the main Blackpool Art School from the age of 16 to 20.</p> <p>Graduating with a first-class national diploma in design and painting in 1952, he went on the following year to the Royal Academy Schools in London, where he completed a five-year diploma course – winning a David Murray scholarship for landscape painting, a silver medal for drawing and a bronze medal for painting – before joining the BBC.</p> <p>I was fortunate enough to work with Stuart as his art director during the late 1980s, and we married in 2000. Post-BBC he continued designing film and TV productions until he was 78, including The Camomile Lawn (1992) for Channel 4, and he also taught at the National Film and Television School. His film work included A Private Function (1984), directed by Malcolm Mowbray.</p> <p>In 1989 he was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry. Admired for his professional expertise and flair, Stuart was also much respected by his colleagues for his personal qualities of humility, kindness, integrity and leadership. </p> <p>He is survived by me, our son, Jack, his daughters, Anna and Lucy, from his first marriage, to Cherry Atkinson, which ended in divorce, and his grandchildren, Milo, Sam and Joe.</p>",

The tunnel, which runs for 15m (50ft), starts under the synagogue and peters out beneath a ritual bath house several buildings along. When cops arrived on Monday to fill it with concrete, they met with strong resistance from the tunnellers. What can only be described as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/jan/10/secret-tunnel-in-brooklyn-synagogue-leads-to-brawl-and-arrests-video\">melee ensued</a>.</p> \n<p>There’s a lot to unpack here, but let’s start with “illegal tunnelling”, which, with all due deference to a group of worshippers in distress, triggers in the abstract a bolt of joy at the sheer range and eccentricity of human behaviour. The tunnel in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighbourhood was reportedly dug by a group of young male students, characterised by Hassidic leaders as “extremist”, for purposes that remain obscure. What is known is that residents in homes neighbouring the synagogue reported suspicious sounds coming from beneath the floor. When city officials turned up to investigate, they unearthed some kind of religious take on The Shawshank Redemption that contravened – big New York obsession, up there with homicide – various building regulations and codes. It’s not a prohibition many of us have had cause to test, but I guess you need a permit to dig a tunnel in the city?</p> \n<p>So much to enjoy here: the bafflement of the cops who, when they turned up, presumably under the illusion they were facing a quiet afternoon on the job, were instead met with a group of furious young men refusing to budge; the subsequent arrival, as things started to kick off, of every news outlet in the city, only adding to the confusion. And, of course, the delight everyone is taking in telling this story. One must assume that, as we speak, the New York Post is putting all its resources into tracking down the tunnellers, or as it refers to them, the “renegade diggers”. As books were thrown, furniture was overturned and reporters reached in desperation to find synonyms for “tunnel” (my favourites: “dusty crevasse” and “makeshift passageway”), members of the NYPD milled about in the manner of those trying not only to figure out what was going on but, in a larger sense, how their lives had led them to this moment. No one was injured.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bdf8dcdc-a4d2-4471-a250-c6413255c6a2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0D4XIaat268?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The entire story, of course, belongs to that very particular “only in New York, kids” subcategory of entertainment, a shining example of which comes around every few years like a comet – often involving real estate, and guaranteed to scatter joy on all those not directly involved. Cast your minds back a few years, for example, to the woman who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/new-york-woman-secret-apartment-bathroom-mirror\">found</a> an entire three-bedroom apartment behind the bathroom mirror in her Roosevelt Island rental unit. Or, going back further, the legendary story of the “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689273526/underground-digs-up-the-secrets-of-hidden-communities-around-the-world\">mole people</a>” of the NYC subway system. Or, reaching back even further to the crown jewel of this sort of thing, the events leading up to the New York Post’s <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2015/06/09/new-york-post-editor-and-film-critic-vincent-musetto-dies-at-74/\">greatest headline</a> of all time: “Headless body in topless bar”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/27/new-york-airbnb-renters-cities-law-ban-properties\">New York is breaking free of Airbnb’s clutches. This is how the rest of the world can follow suit | Anna Minton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But back to 770 Eastern Parkway, referred to locally simply as 770 and the Chabad global headquarters, and the mysterious tunnel. According to some reports, the students in question were engaged in a power grab designed to “expand” the synagogue, which – it would be hard to love the logic more – they saw fit to express via the medium of tunnelling. Accounts vary as to whether it was a men’s or a women’s mikvah that the tunnel emerged in. If the latter, it suggests some unexplored American Pie-type subplot that could lift the whole episode into legend.</p> \n<p>In Brooklyn on Monday, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/secret-tunnel-discovered-in-brooklyn-synagogue-leads-to-brawl-between-police-and-worshippers-13045240\">police arrested 10 people</a> for criminal mischief and criminal trespass and one for obstructing governmental administration. Engineers have been sent, meanwhile, to make sure that the illegal tunnel hasn’t compromised the structural integrity of surrounding buildings. Religious leaders at the synagogue are rightly upset, but for the rest of us it is, perhaps, permissible to enjoy a light moment in an otherwise grim and foreboding start to the new year.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>It’s an unlikely saga that stretches across continents; the story of how an American photography gallery became the custodian of more than a million photos that catalogue momentous events from New Zealand’s history, saving the historic cache from landfill.</p> <p>The vintage images, which were taken by news and art photographers for regional newspapers over more than a century and date back to 1841, depict pivotal scenes in the establishment of modern New Zealand – including protests, disasters and national triumphs – as well as daily life, culturally significant photos of Māori and early images of cities as they grew. Some are the only known copies of those pictures; the negatives for most have been lost or destroyed.</p>    <p>“They should never have left New Zealand,” says Daniel Miller, the owner and director of the Los Angeles-based Duncan Miller gallery, which bought the photos from a bank after the American company that was in possession of them filed for bankruptcy. “It’s the history of a country.”</p> <p>After struggling to find new owners for the full archive, Miller is selling the images online and to institutions. In December, he hand-delivered a trove of more than 5,000 historic photos of Indigenous life to the National Library of New Zealand, a collection the institution described as a “rich and moving visual history” – and which was almost lost for ever.</p>    <p>It all began more than a decade ago with John Rogers, an American businessman who promised news companies that he could save a century of pre-digital newspaper images and sports memorabilia. Among them was Fairfax Media – a former Australian and New Zealand news company – which sent millions of images to Little Rock, Arkansas, in 2013; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/08/fairfax-media-photo-archive-stuck-in-us-warehouse-after-digitising-deal-unravels\">Rogers Photo Archive had offered to digitise</a> the decaying images at no cost and to sell the originals for a profit.</p> <p>But after photos began to show up on eBay, the FBI raided the company and Rogers was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/john-rogers-sports-memorabilia-fraud/\">later jailed for fraud</a>. After the company went bankrupt, the bank took the images as collateral for a loan and Miller was approached by a court-appointed receiver to buy them.</p>    <p>With many of the photos destined for landfill, Miller bought the archive in 2017, expecting that the national libraries of Australia and New Zealand would take the collections off his hands.</p> <p>But Australia’s national library wanted only “a tiny fraction” of the photos. The need to catalogue and preserve the images – some of which were spoiled by black mould – prompted Miller to hire archivists and custom-fit a climate-controlled warehouse in a project that has now spanned four years.</p> <p>“I just felt that I had some sense of responsibility because nobody else stood up to do anything about it,” he says. </p>    <p>Though he didn’t find an immediate home for the complete archive of Australian images, Miller has since sold photos to more than 70 Australian institutions and continues to sell images through local auction house Lawson’s.</p> <p>It has also proved difficult to find owners for the New Zealand archive. But last year, Miller sold to New Zealand’s national library 5,300 images of the country’s Indigenous people – the entire contents of the archive’s Māori collection – delivering the images to Wellington in what he describes as an “emotional” homecoming. </p>    <p>The “depth and breadth” of the photos sourced from newspapers throughout the country over a 70-year period made them a “significant national taonga that will help us tell the stories of Aotearoa,” says Jessica Moran, a library spokesperson, using the Māori word for a treasure.</p> <p>Miller is now approaching sporting bodies and other institutions in hopes of finding more homes for the photos. In the meantime, his company has established an online auction platform for the New Zealand images where photos of major news events of the 20th century – including the Wāhine ferry sinking, the bombing of the ship the Rainbow Warrior and the 1931 Napier earthquake, as well as prominent figures such as the aviator Jean Batten and mountaineer Edmund Hillary – sell for amounts between NZ$80 and the low thousands of dollars.</p>    <p>Such sales are likely to run for years, and Miller – who did not intend to become a curator of antipodean history – hopes that a prominent New Zealander might take over the project.</p> <p>“This just belongs with New Zealand and should be managed by Kiwis,” he says. “There’s a lot of money involved in saving culture here but the archive is in better condition than ever and it’s ready for New Zealand hands.”</p> <p>• The caption on the second image in this article was amended on 15 January 2024. It does show Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on Mount Everest, but they are not at the summit as an earlier version said; the picture was taken the day before their final push.</p>",

\n  <p>However, adjusting the range for current prices involves “adding somewhere between eight and 10 billion pounds”, Thompson explained (PA Media reports), reflecting the impact of inflation on the line’s cost.</p> \n  <p>He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“It is the Government’s long-standing policy that infrastructure estimates are only updated at Spending Review points, that’s my understanding of it.</p> \n   <p>“So that’s why we’re still working to 2019 prices and the whole conversation about 2019, which is to be frank with you an administrative burden of some significance in the organisation.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Back in October, Rishi Sunak cancelled the northern leg of HS2 from Birmingham to Manchester, but the government is pressing on with the

            "body" : "<p>Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, restated Washington’s commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state during a brief trip to the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, a visit dismissed by many residents as “theatre”.</p> <p>Blinken told Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president and head of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/27/corrupt-discredited-could-a-reformed-palestinian-authority-run-gaza\">Palestinian Authority</a> (PA), that the US position was that a Palestinian state must stand alongside Israel, “with both living in peace and security”, a spokesperson said.</p> <p>As Blinken arrived under tight security at Abbas’s headquarters in Ramallah, a group of protesters held up signs that read: “Stop the genocide”, “Free Palestine” and “Blinken out”. Some scuffled with Palestinian security forces in riot gear.</p> <p>Analysts and others in Ramallah said Palestinian expectations of the visit were “lower than low”.</p> <p>“The only purpose is to give the Israelis time to finish off Gaza,” Atef al-Hamoud, a local government functionary, said.</p> <p>Jamal Zakout, an analyst, said: “This war has damaged the image of the US in all Arab countries, not just Palestine. No one can ignore their unfair diplomacy. For three months all the US has done is protect Israel.”</p>    <p>On Tuesday, Blinken met top Israeli officials and repeated calls for greater protection of civilians, more aid to be allowed into Gaza and for residents to be allowed to return home where possible.</p> <p>Hinting at having held difficult talks with Israeli officials on Tuesday, Blinken said the US had a duty to be as forthright as possible with friends and called for Israel to make “hard decisions”.</p> <p>The US has offered staunch support to Israel since the outbreak of its war with Hamas three months ago, but the refusal of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, to offer detailed public plans for the governance of Gaza when Israel’s military offensive ends has angered Washington.</p> <p>Israel has so far ruled out calls to allow the internationally recognised PA to govern Gaza and the occupied West Bank after the conflict’s end – Washington’s preferred option – and instead suggested some form of governance involving local power-brokers or clans, with the Israel Defense Forces playing a significant supervisory role.</p> <p>Netanyahu, whose hold on power depends on far-right support, has also ignored US pressure to rein in ministers who have called for the mass voluntary emigration of Palestinians from Gaza. Washington has said such rhetoric is “inflammatory and unacceptable”.</p> <p>Despite Blinken’s complaint that the “daily toll on civilians in Gaza … is far too high”, heavy fighting continued in Gaza with clashes in the centre and south.</p> <p>At least 23,570 people, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel’s offensive in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Swaths of the territory have been devastated, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced and facing an acute humanitarian crisis. Local officials said at least 147 people had died over the previous 24 hours.</p> <p>Israeli military losses have reached 186 since the beginning of the offensive in Gaza, which came after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their homes and at a music festival on 7 October.</p> <p>Hamas also took about 250 hostages. Israel has said 132 of them remain captive, though at least 25 of these are thought to have been killed.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Blinken voiced hopes that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration, following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other states.</p> <p>The top US diplomat, on his fourth tour of the Middle East since the outbreak of the war, also dismissed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/29/south-africa-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">a case filed by South Africa against Israel at the international court of justice accusing it of genocide</a>, saying the allegation was “meritless” and “particularly galling” as Hamas had called for Israel’s annihilation.</p> <p>Zakout said that any political scenario for after the war needed unity among Palestinian factions.</p> <p>“It will be impossible to implement any deal if Hamas is not included. We need to break not just the [conflict] but this Palestinian polarisation too,” he said.</p> <p>The PA – established in the 1990s as part of the then peace process to run areas in the West Bank and Gaza under Palestinian control – has said it is willing to play a role in Gaza, from where it was expelled by Hamas in 2006, but only if it is part of a clear, comprehensive peace plan with Israel that also includes the West Bank.</p> <p>The political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, said last week he was “open to the idea” of a single Palestinian administration in Gaza and the West Bank.</p> <p>The popularity of Hamas in the West Bank has risen sharply in recent months, despite the devastation caused by the conflict.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/16/israel-force-support-hamas-soars-west-bank-october-attack\">Recent polling </a>from the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research found 85% of West Bank respondents voiced satisfaction with the role of Hamas in the war.</p> <p>Support for Hamas among the Palestinian public has typically spiked during conflicts, pollsters said. The group appears to have also earned significant goodwill for securing the release of 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails in return for 100 hostages, mostly Israeli, during the week-long ceasefire in Gaza at the end of November.</p> <p>“You now see women, progressive feminists in Ramallah, marching for Hamas, not because they love them or adhere to their ideology or want their ideology to prevail but because they see someone saying: ‘I will fight back’ and that is inspiring,” said Nour Odeh, a Ramallah-based commentator.</p> <p>Speaking in his family’s grocer’s store in the Qalandiya camp on the outskirts of Ramallah, 20-year-old Salam Awad said Hamas had “destroyed the pride and morale of Israel”.</p> <p>“Only Hamas can do this, not this useless degenerate,” Awad said, referring to Abbas.</p> <p>Blinken will now travel from the West Bank to the Gulf state of Bahrain, home base of the US Fifth Fleet, for talks with King Hamad on preventing a regional escalation of the war, the state department said.</p> <p>Abbas will travel to the Red Sea port city of Aqaba to discuss a “push for an immediate ceasefire” in Gaza in talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p> <p>The US has consistently rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, though Blinken has called for “more food, more water, more medicine” to reach those in need in the territory.</p> <p>Israeli military officials said Israel was “ready and willing to facilitate as much humanitarian aid as the world will give” and that the highest number of trucks had entered Gaza since the war began. Aid agencies say the quantity remained inadequate given the acute humanitarian suffering caused by the conflict.</p>",

Let’s be honest – it’s been a pretty slow-burn transfer window so far. Sure, at any given moment, someone somewhere will be blethering about Kylian Mbappé and Real Madrid, but that’s been the case for a good few consecutive windows now, so you know, whatever. Jordan Henderson could be heading back to Europe – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/09/ajax-jordan-henderson-leave-saudi-arabia\">Ajax his mooted destination</a> – having solved Saudi Arabia’s human rights problems. And Spurs have been moving quickly, snapping up Timo Werner, a signing that seems to have been met by an “if Big Ange wants him, that’s good enough for us” reaction from the fanbase. What’s more, early talk this morning is of a deal for Genoa’s Radu Dragusin being close to finalisation to plug that Spurs defensive gap, while 2016’s Eric Dier is possibly heading to Bayern Munich. </p> <p>We’ll have more on all this and plenty else besides through the day, so stick around.</p> </div>   </div>",

Reports of mass expulsions across the Algerian and Libyan borders have also surfaced, with people being deported into the desert and ending up in detention centres run by armed groups in war-torn Libya.</p> <p>“Sovereignty is not achieved by intimidating vulnerable groups and resorting to outdated laws and discriminatory circulars, but rather by initiating national policies that guarantee dignity, rights and freedoms for all humans,” the Forum said.</p> <p>In September an official from an intergovernmental organisation said Tunisian authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/tunisia-border-africans-forced-into-desert-eu-deal-europe-violent-treatment\">had relocated</a> more than 4,000 people in July to military buffer zones at the borders with Libya and Algeria, as migrants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/28/tunisia-border-africans-forced-into-desert-eu-deal-europe-violent-treatment\">spoke of being</a> forcibly returned to remote desert regions, where some had died of thirst.</p> <p>Tunisian officials have acknowledged the pushing back of small groups of people across the desert borders but have denied allegations of systemic abuse.</p> <p>Black immigrants living in Tunisia have been on edge since the president, Kais Saied, claimed in February that irregular migration from other parts of Africa was part of an international plot to change the country’s character.</p> <p>Soon after, asylum seekers from sub-Saharan Africa were evicted from their homes while raids were carried out on the neighbourhoods in which they live.</p> <p>Aid workers claim that many refugees, including from Yemen and Sudan, left the country immediately in shoddy metal boats.

It has been nearly a decade since Nike, which <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/21/nike-nke-earnings-q2-2024.html\" title=\"\">said in a recent earnings call</a> it will seek $2bn in cost savings over the next three years, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/04/nike-to-get-out-of-golf-equipment-business.html\" title=\"\">stopped making golf equipment</a>, including balls, clubs and bags. Woods’s limited schedule after his exhaustive litany of surgeries, before and after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/feb/23/tiger-woods-car-crash-injured-hospital-golf-california\" title=\"\">his career-threatening car accident </a>in February 2021, have made the 15-time major champion less visible than ever.</p> <p>But there is a specific finality to Monday’s conscious uncoupling, which came one week after Woods’s 48th birthday, that signals the end of an era in the business of sport: the death of the sort of all-encompassing athlete-brand marriage that truly flooded the cultural mainstream. The obvious template is Nike’s union with Michael Jordan, a leviathan deal whose modest origins were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/apr/05/air-review-ben-affleck-matt-damon-michael-jordan-nike-shoe\" title=\"\">playfully dramatized for the screen</a> last year. Indeed, Phil Knight spent three years aggressively recruiting Woods based on the Jordan proof of concept: that a single charismatic sportsperson touched with divine gifts could shoulder an entire sports-entertainment empire. “Everybody has been looking for the next Michael Jordan and they were looking on the basketball court,” the Nike chairman said at the time. “And he was walking down the fairway all the time.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/08/tiger-woods-and-nike-bring-500m-27-year-partnership-to-an-end\">Tiger Woods and Nike bring $500m, 27-year partnership to an end</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Woods was already among the biggest names in sport when, days after roaring back from five strokes down to win his third straight US Amateur in 1996, he announced he was dropping out of Stanford University and entering the paid ranks with two words: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLf3Gb5TcXs\" title=\"\">“Hello, world.”</a> Given the present-day state of the newspaper industry, let’s just say Nike’s <a href=\"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/1996/08/29/Sponsorships-Advertising-Marketing/TIGER-OUT-OF-THE-WOODS-HELLO-WORLD-SWEET-OR-CONTRIVED.aspx\" title=\"\">three-page spread in the Wall Street Journal</a> announcing his arrival would not make the same splash today.</p> <p>He immediately made good on the dizzying hype, winning four tour events in his first eight months, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/we-had-no-idea-25-years-on-from-tiger-woods-epic-debut-masters\" title=\"\">epochal 1997 Masters</a> that launched his already soaring profile into the stratosphere. Woods soon delivered a return on investment that far exceeded the initial terms of $40m over five years. To call him the world’s most dominant athlete, which he was, only undersold his broader significance. He was larger than life, the rare chosen one who not only met but surpassed all expectations and held the world in his thrall, winning majors by record margins and conjuring one unforgettable moment after another.</p> <p>Some of them Nike could not have scripted better on a backstage lot, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJEysanOT7w\" title=\"\">his chip-in from the rough</a> during the final round of the 2005 Masters where the ball hung on the edge for more than a second, the company’s “swoosh” logo perfectly in frame, before dropping into the cup.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_X6BWJvGfo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O_X6BWJvGfo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The most recent 10-year agreement between Woods and Nike was reportedly worth about $200m, but what people will remember years from now is the commercial iconography. Nike’s creative partnership with the Wieden+Kennedy advertising agency created campaigns that managed to go beyond the transactional nature of advertising into the realm of pop art. For every <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG2JYpiM48U\" title=\"\">Juggle</a>, the playful 30-second spot featuring Tiger playing a bit of keepie-uppie with an iron before finally whacking the ball into the distance, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X73pdMolf3w\" title=\"\">Golf’s Not Hard</a>, which allowed him to flex his comic chops, there were others that pushed the boundaries of the mainstream and even flirted with the avant-garde, like the 60-second spot consisting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHcP6X7dEUo\" title=\"\">entirely of one swing in slow motion</a> against a spartan black background. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O_X6BWJvGfo?si=GqAhg0JjgZynDVM4\" title=\"\">Never</a>, which debuted before the 2008 US Open (where he would stage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/17/usopengolf.tigerwoods\" title=\"\">an extraordinary 19th-hole playoff win</a>), relied on a voiceover from Tiger’s father, Earl, who had died of cancer two years previously.</p> <p>Even at their most overwrought – like the famed <a href=\"https://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/6686319/i-am-tiger-woods/nike\" title=\"\">I Am Tiger Woods</a> spot, which borrowed liberally from the coda of Spike Lee’s 1993 magnum opus <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq32ZgtY7O8\" title=\"\">Malcolm X</a> – they were earnest enough in their hyperbole to succeed. (That all these carefully spun myths would be shattered when Woods’s personal life imploded in 2009 in one of the biggest tabloid scandals in history makes the work all the more compelling.)</p> <p>People got excited when a new Tiger ad dropped, an enthusiasm only boosted by their scarcity in a pre-YouTube age, when happening across it on television was the only way of seeing it. The golden age of the Woods-Nike partnership overlapped with the final days of the American monoculture, giving their work a platform and reach that does not exist any more. Traditional network TV audiences were fragmenting even before getting splintered to oblivion by the ascent of streaming services. People simply don’t watch TV like they used to, young people in particular. It is unlikely that some of Nike and W+K’s biggest coups – whether the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP5Ye5-LES8\" title=\"\">Brazil airport commercial</a> before the 1998 World Cup or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERzrK-oZFWY\" title=\"\">affecting McIlroy-Woods spot</a> – would have been afforded the space to make the same impact in today’s media landscape.</p> <p>The signposts for this break have been there for years. In 2018, longtime Nike athlete Roger Federer – one of the few sports stars whose association with a brand felt as permanent as Woods – left Nike after 24 years for the Japanese clothing retail chain Uniqlo on a 10-year, $300m contract. Elsewhere, there is evidence that rappers and entertainers have gained ground if not surpassed athletes as sneaker ambassadors, whether it is Adidas going all-in on Kanye West in its play for the youth market or, to a lesser extent, Jack Harlow sharing billing with LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard at New Balance.</p> <p>LeBron James is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/07/we-are-all-witnesses-lebron-james-signs-historic-lifetime-deal-with-nike\" title=\"\">Nike for life</a>, which is notable given his overarching disruptive embrace of athletes as individual brands.

            "body" : "<p>I’m rubbish at packing. Be it for a night away or for several months, I’m hopeless. I never, but never, fail to forget something essential. A toothbrush, medication, pants, the suitcase itself – you name it. And always, but always, more than half of what I take isn’t needed. I’ve given up worrying about this. When I was a younger man I was foolish enough to harbour hopes of one day wanting for nothing while I was away. Never happened; never will.</p> <p>But I’d rather be me than one of those clever dicks who fits enough for a month in the tiniest, piddliest little cases which, notwithstanding their laughable smallness, are nevertheless equipped with no fewer than four wheels. Four! You see them in airports, these things, their smug owners wheeling them around like they’re walking prim little poodles off to the shops.</p> <p>I curse them all, apart from my mum. She has many gifts, and this is her greatest. Weeks before going off to Croatia for months on end, she will begin packing the very tiniest of wheelie bags. Honestly, I take a bigger bag to work. I bought it for her, partly as a joke. “This is too small, even for you,” I said. I was wrong. She doesn’t so much pack it as curate it. Over many weeks, bits go in, come out, are turned around and upside down and endlessly rearranged. Come departure day I am summoned to sit on the thing to facilitate zip closure. By now this tiny bit of luggage is improbably heavy, like one of those remarkably dense metals. She can barely wheel it, let alone lift it. If flying alone, she is reliant on the kindness of strangers to get it up into the overhead bin. Many a poor chap has had his holiday ruined, his back in spasm having been fooled by the size and assumed light weight.</p> <p>Meanwhile all I can do is take the biggest suitcases I can carry and stuff them with anything and everything that comes to hand. The more I pack, the fewer things it’ll turn out I haven’t got. Pitiable logic, I know, but it’s how I have found my peace. How liberating it is to travel without hope.</p> <ul> <li><p>Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lv6ALv8kJY\">video ad</a> posted on Tuesday, for instance, says “demand for energy is growing and so is the need for American oil and natural gas”, positioning the sector as essential to continued human flourishing – a form of discourse Roberts and his co-authors call an “appeal to wellbeing”.</p> <p>In his CNN interview, Sommers said clean energy can currently only play a limited role. “Renewable sources have a role to play, but oil and natural gas will be needed for decades,” he said.</p> <p>In doing so, he employed a second discursive strategy known as “change is impossible”, which<em> </em>denies the ability for large-scale transformation, Roberts said, adding that the statement may be a “self fulfilling prophecy”, as fossil fuel companies still invest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/23/companies-still-investing-too-much-in-fossil-fuels-global-energy-watchdog-says\">minimally</a> in carbon-free energy.</p> <p>The claim also ignores copious <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/raising-ambition/renewable-energy-transition\">evidence</a> that the world can begin to phase out fossil fuels, and <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/\">must do so</a> to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis, said Caleb Heeringa, campaign director of Gas Leaks, a nonprofit attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/20/gas-leaks-horror-movie-climate-change-campaign\">counter pro-gas messaging</a>.</p> <p>“We aren’t saying we can turn off the spigot tomorrow,” he said. “But [the industry] is trying to expand the fossil fuel system, expand pipelines, expand fracking, and make more of our economy and our existence dependent on fossil fuels, even though clean energy is advancing at a rapid rate.”</p> <p>The campaign also states that increased gas usage is a “key reason” that US carbon emissions have fallen, employing a tactic Roberts calls “fossil fuel solutionism” by framing polluting energy as a climate solution.</p> <p>The ad blitz states that gas use led to a drop in CO2 emissions, but fails to mention the attendant rise in emissions of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/climate/natural-gas-leaks-coal-climate-change.html\">methane</a>, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planet-heating than carbon dioxide in the short term, Heeringa said. It also refers to the “reliability” of gas-powered energy, “despite significant gas system failures” during weather emergencies such as <a href=\"https://www.power-eng.com/news/ferc-nerc-final-report-natural-gas-struggled-the-most-during-winter-storm-elliott/#gref\">2022’s winter storm Elliott</a> and 2021’s <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/gas-malfunction\">winter storm Uri</a>.</p> <p>The campaign comes amid industry <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/business/big-oil-ceo-war-in-middle-east-price-surge/index.html\">claims</a> that Israel’s war in Gaza will threaten energy security by inhibiting the flow of oil out of the region.</p> <p>“This should be a real concern, I think, to every American,” Sommers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/business/big-oil-ceo-war-in-middle-east-price-surge/index.html\">told CNN</a>.</p> <p>It seems like an attempt to take advantage of a crisis to maximize profit, said Patrick Galey, a senior fossil fuels investigator at Global Witness. In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/22/gas-industry-ukraine-war-biden-policy\">similarly</a> called to expand domestic extraction, as Global Witness <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/us-gas-windfall-and-lobbying/\">tracked</a>.</p> <p>“Evidence suggests the fossil fuel lobby are not letting the latest crisis – this time in the Red Sea due to Israel’s carpet bombing of Gaza – go to waste, either,” said Galey. “Until countries rapidly and justly phase out fossil fuels, consumers will continue to be prey to the whims of despotic petrostates and feeding frenzies from the oil and gas lobbies whenever the next crisis hits.”</p> <p>In a Wednesday press release, API’s Sommers noted the US produces more energy than any other country, something that “can’t be sustained without the right policies from Washington”.</p> <p>API did not directly address questions from the Guardian regarding the scientific consensus that fossil fuels must be phased out, or experts’ concerns about the campaign.</p>",

It follows an immortal warrior on a millennia-long journey to understand his immortality.</p> <p>The novel is due to be published on 23 July by Penguin. Reeves, who is best known for his roles in The Matrix and John Wick franchises, said it was “extraordinary” to work with Miéville. “China did exactly what I was hoping for – he came in with a clear architecture for the story and how he wanted to play with the world of BRZRKR, a world that I love so much. I was thrilled with his vision and feel honoured to be a part of this collaborative process.”</p> <p>Miéville’s novels include The City &amp; The City, Embassytown and Perdido Street Station. He is the only writer to have won the Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction three times.</p> <p>“Sometimes the greatest games are those you play with other people’s toys,” said Miéville on the collaboration. “It was an honour, a shock and a delight when Keanu invited me to play. But I could never have predicted how generous he’d be with toys he’s spent so long creating,” he added.</p> <p>Upon its release, BRZRKR, created with writer Matt Kindt and artist Ron Garney, became the highest-selling original comic book series debut in more than 25 years. The comic will also be adapted into a live-action Netflix film starring Reeves, and an anime series.</p>    <p>“Keanu Reeves and China Miéville are a dream writing partnership,” said Ben Brusey, publishing director at Del Rey, the Penguin imprint publishing the novel in the UK. “Both are master storytellers who have thrilled, surprised and won the hearts and minds of audiences and readers for decades.</p> <p>“The Book of Elsewhere is science fiction at its very best – dazzling high-concept, beguiling characters and a profound, original plot that blends action, drama and existentialism in a bravura way that will leave readers moved and amazed,” he added.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Book of Elsewhere by Keanu Reeves and China Miéville will be published on 23 July by Penguin (£22).

Francis called strikes on civilians and vital infrastructure “vile” and “unacceptable”, adding that they “cannot be justified in any way”. In the statement, Francis urged the international community and all involved in the conflict to seek peaceful solutions.</p> <p>While the pope has pleaded for peace previously, with numerous appeals for “martyred Ukraine”, he has faced criticism in some Ukrainian quarters for appearing reluctant to openly criticise Russia, especially at the start of the war.

He added: “For the results of sanctions to be 100%, sanctions loopholes must also be blocked 100%.”</p></li> <li><p>Two drones <strong>hit and set on fire a fuel facility in the Russian city of Oryol, 230 miles south of Moscow and 137 miles from the Ukrainian border</strong>, said the local governor, Andrei Klychkov.</p></li> <li><p>Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Russia’s Kursk region, said the <strong>village of Gornal, Sudzhansky district,</strong> was shelled “from the Ukrainian side” with one person killed.</p></li> <li><p>The Kremlin said the Russian military would do everything in its power to tackle an <strong>increase in Ukrainian shelling of the border city of Belgorod</strong>, which is a staging point for Russia’s invasion forces and has come under shelling and drone attacks for months.</p></li> <li><p>The White House said Russia had <strong>launched multiple missiles sourced from North Korea into Ukraine</strong> on 6 January and the US would demand at the UN security council that Russia be held accountable. North Korea’s apparent <strong>export of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) to Russia violates UN law</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>A <strong>joint statement signed by the US, UK, EU, Australia, Germany, Canada</strong> and other partner nations said: “We are deeply concerned about the security implications that this cooperation has in Europe, on the Korean peninsula, across the Indo-Pacific region, and around the world … We condemn in the strongest possible terms <strong>[North Korea’s] export and</strong> <strong>Russia’s procurement of [North Korea’s] ballistic missiles</strong>, as well as Russia’s use of these missiles against Ukraine.<strong>”</strong></p></li> <li><p>Ukraine has been <strong>repelling Russian cyber-attacks on state payment systems</strong> for the second week in a row, senior lawmaker Danylo Hetmantsev said.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is scheduled to deliver a “special address” to the World Economic Forum (WEF)</strong> in Davos next week. The conflict in the Middle East is set to dominate the annual forum, held this year under the theme Rebuilding Trust.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s power grid operator said severe winter weather had left <strong>more than 1,000 towns and villages without electricity in nine regions</strong>, as the energy system has been weakened by Russian strikes. Ukraine had to import electricity from neighbouring Romania and Slovakia, Ukrenergo said.</p></li> <li><p>Russian investigators said they had <strong>arrested three people over heating outages south of Moscow</strong> that have sent regional officials scrambling to restore services. Authorities blamed the breakdown on failures at a boiler plant owned by a private ammunition factory. The deputy head of the local administration was also detained.</p></li> <li><p>Sweden is providing about <strong>50m krona (£3.8m) to the Nato assistance fund for Ukraine</strong>, the Swedish embassy in Kyiv wrote on X.</p></li> <li><p>Hungary indicated that it might <strong>lift its veto over EU aid to Ukraine if the funding is reviewed each year</strong>, Politico reported. Three EU diplomatic sources said Budapest indicated it might withdraw its opposition if the European Council unanimously approves the funding on a yearly basis, meaning Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, could extract concessions from the bloc.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine has a <strong>deficit of anti-aircraft guided missiles after recent Russian attacks</strong>, air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat was quoted as saying. “Ukraine has spent a considerable reserve on those three attacks that took place,” Ihnat told Ukrainian TV.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-10T09:00:43.405Z\">at 9.00am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Angela Constance, Scotland’s justice secretary, said she would discuss a deal signed in 2020 with Fujitsu to support electronic vote counts for local elections with fellow ministers.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office did not respond to questions about whether it would follow Scotland’s lead and review Fujitsu contracts or the company’s strategic supplier status, or why it had continued to be awarded business after Horizon was proved to be faulty.</p> <p>“I have no idea why the government is continuing to give Fujitsu contracts – very, very big contracts,” said the Conservative former cabinet minister David Jones. “I can’t understand why the government wants to continue to deal with them.”</p> <p>The 2019 court of appeal ruling determined that the Post Office had been in “denial” about “bugs, errors and flaws” in Horizon in the “21st-century equivalent of maintaining the Earth is flat”, marking a turning point for victims.</p> <p>Fujitsu has made almost £7bn from 200 IT contracts since 2012. Its four biggest repeat customers are the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office, HMRC and the Financial Conduct Authority, which gave it 68 contracts between them worth more than £2.7bn since 2012.</p> <p>The company, which has never faced any form of punishment for its role in the Horizon scandal, has £2.9bn worth of public sector contracts due to expire over the next two years.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Kevin Hollinrake, the UK minister with responsibility for postal affairs, said Fujitsu could face “financial sanctions” to help fund compensation for subpostmasters and their families if it is found at fault.</p> <p>Fujitsu executives have been summoned to give evidence to MPs on the Commons business and trade committee next week.<br><br>The Metropolitan police have interviewed two Fujitsu employees under caution in relation to allegations of perjury and perverting the course of justice related to Post Office trials.</p> <p>In 2013, the security companies G4S and Serco <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/12/g4s-serco-tagging-contracts-fraud-allegations-monitoring-criminals#:~:text=Across%20government%20there%20is%20now,health%20over%20the%20tagging%20dispute.\">handed back their contracts</a> to electronically tag criminals after fraud allegations over the way they charged the government for their services.</p> <p>The government has a list of 39 strategic suppliers, with each assigned a crown representative, who are <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7e0fcce5274a2e87daf4b7/he_Role_of_the_Cabinet_Office.pdf\">members of the commercial relationships board</a> (CRB), which meets monthly and assigns an overall performance rating of black, red, amber or green (RAG) to each company.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office ultimately oversees suppliers and contracts.</p> <p>Vincent Kelly, who has held roles at Logica, the mobile phone company Orange and music royalties collection body PRS for Music, is the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-suppliers/crown-representatives-and-strategic-suppliers\">crown representative</a> for suppliers including Fujitsu and Virgin Media O2 and has worked in the role for the Cabinet Office since 2018.</p> <p>In 2018, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/carillion-what-went-wrong-liquidation-staff\">collapse of the outsourcing company Carillion</a>, the public accounts committee (PAC) moved to investigate “weaknesses” in government contracting. The subsequent report criticised the government for running a procurement process that <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/3941/strategic-suppliers-inquiry/news/98462/government-must-be-more-assertive-in-forming-market-for-procurement/\">incentivised cost controls and not ensuring the right supplier</a> was selected.</p> <p>“It must look with fresh eyes at the motivations of companies currently bidding for central government work, and develop a strategy that requires contract-awarding bodies to look beyond bottom-line costs,” said Meg Hillier, the PAC chair, at the time. “Crucial to this will be to embed procurement best practice across departments.”</p> <p>It also criticised the RAG rating system as not working “either as a carrot or a stick” and said there must always be “effective oversight” of the crown representative system and the close relationship enjoyed with suppliers.</p> <p>“Without effective oversight of these relationships there is a risk that strategic suppliers become secretive ‘sub-departments’ of Whitehall,” said Hillier.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “This was one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history, which is why we set up an independent inquiry to establish culpability and are bringing forward legislation to make sure those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.<br><br>“It is right that we do not pre-empt the conclusions of the ongoing, formal inquiry, but once the full facts are established we will consider all options to hold those responsible for this scandal to account – both legally and financially.<br><br>“Ahead of that, and as with all contracts, we continue to keep Fujitsu’s conduct and commercial performance under review.”</p>",

All five have captured the imagination of both the public and film industry over the past year, Bafta said.</p> <p>Elordi – one of the biggest stars of Gen Z, who rose to prominence with his role in HBO’s Euphoria – can be seen in two awards season contenders currently streaming and in cinemas. He stars as Felix in Emerald Fennell’s hit psychological comedy-thriller Saltburn, and as Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla.</p> <p>His forthcoming projects include The Narrow Road to the Deep North, an Australian limited series set during the second world war based on Richard Flanagan’s Booker prize-winning novel, as well as Oh Canada in which he stars alongside Uma Thurman and Richard Gere.</p> <p>Dyenvor is most recognisable for her role as Daphne in Shonda Rhimes’ global phenomenon Bridgerton. Most recently, she starred in Chloe Domont’s finance thriller Fair Play, about a couple whose relationship starts to unravel after an unexpected promotion at a cutthroat hedge fund firm. She is also set to star opposite Diane Lane and Zoey Deutch in the forthcoming thriller Anniversary.</p> <p>Comedian, writer, producer and actor Edebiri won a Golden Globe this week for her role as Sydney in the breakout TV show The Bear, and is also nominated for an Emmy. She most recently starred in Bottoms, a satirical comedy which follows the story of two high-school senior girls who set up a fight club as a vehicle to hook up with cheerleaders.</p> <p>McKenna-Bruce received acclaim for her lead performance in Molly Manning Walker’s How to Have Sex, about three British teenage girls on a trip to Malia. She also starred as Mary Musgrove, the younger sister of Dakota Johnson’s Anne Elliot, in the film adaptation of Jane Austen’s Persuasion.</p> <p>Wilde most recently appeared as the lead in Talk to Me, which critics called one of the scariest horror movies of recent years. The project quickly became one of A24’s highest grossing films of 2023. Wilde will next appear in Baby Girl, alongside Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson.</p> <p>The nominees were announced during a press conference at the Savoy Hotel in London by actor and producer Stephen Graham and film critic and radio host Ali Plumb. They were selected by a panel of industry jurors including actors Daisy Edgar-Jones, Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù and Himesh Patel.</p> <p>Jane Millichip, CEO at Bafta, said: “These remarkable individuals represent what Bafta and the EE Rising Star award stand for as the future of the film industry, embodying innovation, dedication and a commitment to storytelling that captivates audiences worldwide.”</p> <p>The EE Rising Star is the only award voted for by the British public. Voting is now open at <a href=\"http://ee.co.uk/why-ee/ee-baftas\">ee.co.uk/BAFTA</a> until midday 16<sup> </sup>February, with the winner announced at the awards ceremony on 18 February.

He was born in Hawaii. Cruz’s father was Cuban and his mother American. He was born in Canada and moved to Texas when young.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/14th-amendment.htm#:~:text=Passed%20by%20the%20Senate%20on,laws%2C%E2%80%9D%20extending%20the%20provisions%20of\">14th amendment</a> to the US constitution – the same text under which Colorado and Maine now seek to remove Trump from the ballot for inciting an insurrection – says “all persons born or naturalised in the United States” are citizens. It was introduced after the civil war, conferring citizenship on people once enslaved. The constitution <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S1-C5-1/ALDE_00013692/\">requires</a> that a presidential candidate must be a resident for 14 years, at least 35 years old, and a “natural-born citizen”.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-nikki-haley-eligible-president-140548395483\">described</a> in Haley’s autobiography, her parents “were born in the Punjab region of India”. Haley was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, in 1972, a US citizen at birth. Her father became a US citizen in 1978, her mother in 2003. Haley was governor of her home state from 2011 to 2017, then ambassador to the United Nations when Trump was president.</p> <p>In the race for the Republican nomination, Haley has surged in polling.

Loomer, a far-right, Islamophobic, white-supremacist Florida activist who has run unsuccessfully for Congress, is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/14/laura-loomer-trump-praise-white-supremacist\">ardent Trump supporter</a>.</p> <p>Experts agree Haley is qualified to be president, simply because she was born on US soil.

            "body" : "<h2><strong>UP FOR THE (MILK) CUP</strong></h2> <p>Welcome to the 1,549th edition of Let’s All Laugh at Chelsea™, in which Football Daily riffs on the club’s latest defeat, at Championship middlers Middlesbrough in their Fizzy Cup semi-final first leg. Boro goalscorer Hayden Hackney was already the subject of interest from Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool before his well-taken goal, which means he’ll probably be a Chelsea player by the time the second leg rolls around.</p> <p>There is something wonderful about the idea of Chelsea scouts attending the game, noting Hackney’s surging runs past the other midfielders they had earmarked just a few months earlier – Moisés Caicedo and Enzo Fernández, yep, we are once again looking at you – before producing a glowing report to Mauricio Pochettino to explain why the Boro man should be snapped up immediately. Although based on the club’s recent transfer policy, Chelsea and Todd Boehly are just as likely to sign Hackney because he’s a cooler, more hipster London borough than he is a long-term fix for their footballing woes.</p> <p>Of course, this particular Hackney is not actually a London borough at all, but a very good England Under-21 footballer, who captained his local side in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/06/middlesbrough-aston-villa-fa-cup-match-report\">FA Cup defeat by Aston Villa</a> on Saturday. Boro are no mugs either, despite this season’s inconsistent league campaign. Michael Carrick steered his side to fourth in last year’s Championship table and has every hope of defending the 1-0 lead at Stamford Bridge in the second leg, as the club strive to repeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/08/michael-carrick-urges-middlesbrough-to-evoke-spirit-of-2004-against-chelsea\">their famous 2004 triumph</a> in this competition.</p> <p>Two other teams also aiming to secure this season’s first bit of Fizzy silverware are Liverpool and Fulham, with the latter hoping to survive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2024/jan/10/when-liverpool-thrashed-fulham-10-0-in-the-1986-87-league-cup\">an Anfield shoeing</a> in the first leg on Wednesday. This is Fulham’s first appearance in the semi-finals, so uncharted territory for the London side, who have won just one of their past 11 meetings with Liverpool. But hey, look on the bright side! At least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/09/liverpool-injury-crisis-intensifies-after-trent-alexander-arnold-ruled-out-for-weeks-football\">Trent Alexander-Arnold is knacked</a>!</p> <p>Perhaps Fulham will give themselves a chance for the second leg. Maybe Chelsea will beat Boro 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in their own return fixture, Cole Palmer will remember he is quite good at this football malarkey, Levi Colwill will double check he hasn’t had his bootlaces tied together again by Isaiah Jones, Christopher Nkunku will return from injury with a matchwinning performance and Pochettino will look down on his £1bn squad with paternal affection. Or maybe the Blues will give Football Daily the chance to write the 1,550th edition of Let’s All Laugh at Chelsea™.

A lot of people see athletes as robots. It was quite hard for me a few years ago after my heart condition. I’d been out for a while and had gained a bit of weight because I physically couldn’t do anything. It’s not like we train for a week and suddenly you’re fully fit and ready to go.

            "body" : "<p>It was the largest primate ever to have roamed the Earth, but just why – and when – our distant cousin “giganto” ended up extinct has been something of a mystery.</p> <p>Now researchers say the enormous ape was victim of an unfortunate choice of food when its preferred snacks became scarce.</p> <p><em>Gigantopithecus blacki </em><em> </em>roamed mainland south-east Asia 2 million years ago, with estimates suggesting it was three metres tall and weighed 200-300kg – roughly three to four times a human’s weight.</p> <p>Previous studies have shown giganto’s range decreased considerably by about 330,000 years ago, but unpicking the cause of its extinction has been a challenge as it was unclear when exactly it was wiped out.</p> <p>Dr Kira Westaway of Macquarie University, co-lead author of the study, said: “If you don’t have an accurate timeline, then you’re just looking for clues in the wrong places.</p> <p>“It was assumed that the deterioration in forests was the cause of its demise as it couldn’t live in open grasslands – but our study shows that this [shift to savannah] occurred at about 200,000 [years ago] when <em>G</em><em> blacki </em>was already extinct.”</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06900-0\">the journal Nature</a>, Westaway and colleagues report how they used a host of techniques to date giganto teeth from 11 caves in China, as well as the cave sediments. They also dated sediments from 11 caves where no giganto remains were found.</p> <p>The results revealed giganto died out between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago. The researchers then pieced together the environmental conditions in which giganto lived, analysing pollen, animal fossils and sediments within the caves, together with stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen.<br><br>The results suggest about 700,000 to 600,000 years ago giganto’s environment began to shift from dense forests with patches of grassland, to more open forests – apparently a result of climate change away from fairly stable conditions.</p> <p>“We’re getting a very strong wet season and a very strong dry season,” Westaway said.</p> <p>This changed the forest plant communities, and meant fruits that had been available year-round were scarce during drier periods.</p> <p>The team explored the changing diet of giganto by analysing wear patterns on its teeth as well as its internal chemical makeup. They compared the findings with those from the Chinese orangutan, a close relative that went extinct much later.</p> <p>The results suggest the orangutan<em> </em>feasted on leaves and flowers from the forest canopy in lieu of fruit. However, giganto – which was less mobile and able to forage – took a different approach. “The key to [the apes’] survival was what they use as a fallback food,” said Westaway. “Giganto chose a very unnutritious backup food – he was eating really fibrous things like bark and twigs on the floor.”</p> <p>By about 300,000 years ago giganto populations were struggling. “Giganto, being a very specialist feeder and habitat specialist, just really couldn’t adapt,” said Westaway.</p> <p>Prof Hervé Bocherens of the University of Tuebingen, who was not involved in the study, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/earths-largest-ever-ape-died-out-because-it-refused-to-eat-its-greens-study\">said earlier research of his had also</a> highlighted a lack of flexibility was behind giganto’s demise, suggesting it stuck with a diet of plants from a densely forested landscape even when other species at the same site consumed grass from savannah environments.</p> <p>But, he added: “Our previous work did not benefit from the same robust chronological framework as this new paper, so we could not develop a scenario as detailed as the authors did.”</p> <p>Westaway said the research had important implications, given concerns over a sixth mass extinction. “It’s really important to understand how primates respond to environmental stresses and how some species are more vulnerable and some are more resilient,” she said.</p>",

On Tuesday, the judges didn’t seem convinced. Asked whether a president could order US Navy Seals to kill a political rival with immunity, Trump’s head lawyer D John Sauer answered a “qualified yes”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/09/stephen-colbert-nikki-haley-civil-war-late-night-recap\">Stephen Colbert on Nikki Haley’s civil war gaffe: ‘A ridiculous thing to forget’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“If the president can order Seal Team Six to kill a political rival,” said Kimmel, “Trump had better lock the doors at Mar-a-Lago because Bazooka Joe Biden has every reason to blow it to kingdom come.”</p> <p>In response to his tough day in court, Trump released a video to supporters in which he claimed that “people are angry that I’ve done such a good job”.</p> <p>“Do you think he actually thinks he did a good job?” Kimmel wondered. “When my son scribbles a circle with a face on it, I say: ‘Good job.’ But even he knows I’m patronizing him, and he’s in kindergarten.”</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmAKZFPpbOU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kmAKZFPpbOU?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert looked into the strange case of an Alaska Airlines flight whose door popped off at 16,000ft. (No one was injured, but certainly people were spooked.)</p> <p>According to an official report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the panel on the plane may not have been properly attached. “Ya think?!” Colbert responded. “It reminds me of the NTSB’s groundbreaking report on the Hindenburg: kaboom!”</p> <p>The good news, Colbert explained, was that the bolts that should have held the door in place may not have come loose, as previously speculated. The bad news is that it’s possible the bolts were never even installed. “I know that sounds like a major screw-up, but they were just following the instructions: put door on plane, wonder why you have extra bolts, enjoy unlimited leg room,” Colbert joked.</p> <p>In response to the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded all 200 Boeing Max 9 planes in the US, saying it could take four to eight hours to inspect each of them.</p> <p>“I think I speak for all travelers when I say: take your time. Do not rush. Be thorough,” Colbert said.</p> <p>The incident was bad news for Boeing, whose stock fell 10% this week. “Well, their stock wouldn’t have fallen if they remembered to put the bolts on it!”</p> <p>It’s also a scandal for Alaska Airlines, which kept the plane in service despite repeated issues with cabin pressure, enough so that the company decided the plane could no longer be used for flights to Hawaii.</p> <p>“Sure, we wouldn’t want the plane to crash into the ocean,” Colbert deadpanned. “Much safer for it to crash over a densely populated city. Maybe somebody could catch it!”</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3E7YmQDpaE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L3E7YmQDpaE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers touched on Joe Biden’s latest speech blasting Trump for attempting to overturn the election, calling him a “loser”.</p> <p>“Oh, come on,” said Meyers. “What has Trump ever lost, besides an airline, his hotel, his golf course, the popular vote twice, the electoral vote once, two wives, a casino, most of his hair and his mind?”</p> <p>In other Trump news, a Jeffrey Epstein accuser claims to have a sex tape of the former president. “I don’t know – I think if there was a sex tape we would’ve seen it by now,” said Meyers. “In a Trump campaign ad.”</p> <p>Maryland congressman Steny Hoyer announced his plan to run for re-election at the age of 84. “Steny, man, you know you’re old when your name doesn’t even exist anymore,” said Meyers. “It’s like having a congressman named Ramses.”</p> <p>And in a speech, Pope Francis called for a universal ban on surrogacy because it “exploits” the relationship between a mother and child. “OK, but it seemed to work out for you in the past,” said Meyers over a photo of a Virgin Mary figurine.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The Italian government is embroiled in a fresh controversy after a junior culture minister was placed under investigation over allegations that a 17th-century painting in his possession was stolen from a castle more than a decade ago.</p> <p>Vittorio Sgarbi, a well-known art critic, is also accused of tampering with the painting in order to disguise its origins.</p> <p>Prosecutors said they were investigating Sgarbi for the alleged laundering of stolen art after claims broadcast by Report, an investigative series on the public broadcaster Rai. He denies the allegations.</p> <p>Margherita Buzio, the owner of La Cattura di San Pietro (The Capture of Saint Peter), a painting by the artist Rutilio Manetti, reported the work stolen from her castle in Piedmont in 2013, telling police at the time that the canvas had been cut from its frame. A person identified by Report as a friend of Sgarbi is alleged to have visited the castle a few weeks before to inquire about buying the painting.</p> <p>The painting, which was damaged during the theft, was entrusted to an art restorer for repair a few months later, according to the allegations. The restorer told Report that the artwork he was given was the stolen painting. In 2019, the painting was transferred to another restorer, by which time a candle had been added to the top left corner, allegedly to make it less identifiable. It is unclear who put the candle there, but the painting was the same artwork presented by Sgarbi at an exhibition in Lucca in 2021.</p> <p>Sgarbi has said the painting on show was the original version of The Capture of Saint Peter, which he said he found while restoring an abandoned villa bought by his mother in Viterbo in 2000. He said the painting stolen from the castle was a “bad copy” produced in the 19th century.</p> <p>Sgarbi told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that those claiming he modified the painting were “ignorant”. “Manetti’s style was just that – he put candles everywhere,” he said. “My painting is the original, the other is a badly made copy.”</p> <p>He accused the restorer of making the allegations “in revenge” over money he owed him.</p> <p>Opposition parties have called for Sgarbi to be sacked. Irene Manzi, a politician with the centre-left Democratic party who heads a parliamentary culture committee, said the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, “must stop protecting” Sgarbi, who is also being investigated by Italy’s anti-trust authority for allegedly accepting lucrative fees for appearing at cultural events. The Five Star Movement said it would present a motion in parliament for Sgarbi’s dismissal.</p> <p>The case comes after Meloni was forced to suspend a politician from her far-right Brothers of Italy party after a gun owned by him was accidentally fired at a New Year’s Eve party.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A spectre has long haunted Israel: the spectre of South Africa. Specifically, Israeli leaders have feared that a world recognising their oppression of Palestinians <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/04/27/abusive-israeli-policies-constitute-crimes-apartheid-persecution\">as an apartheid system</a> might be moved to impose on Israel the same international isolation that helped end South Africa’s system of white minority rule. However, few Israeli leaders would have expected that impetus to come in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/29/south-africa-accuses-israel-of-committing-genocide-in-gaza\">South African lawsuit in The Hague</a> alleging genocide.</p> \n<p>Recent UN general assembly votes show that most of the international community is appalled by Israel’s brutalisation<strong> </strong>of Gaza, yet appears unable to act. It’s as if Israel is shielded by an unspoken but commonly accepted US prerogative to set the terms of any international interventions in the Middle East. Indeed, what makes the South African action all the more remarkable is the reality that when you indict Israel for genocide, you’re effectively accusing its armourer and diplomatic enabler – the US – of being an accomplice to the crime of all crimes.</p> \n<p>So, why has South Africa taken this bold step?</p> \n<p>The late president Nelson Mandela had assumed, on behalf of his people, a moral burden when he <a href=\"http://www.mandela.gov.za/mandela_speeches/1997/971204_palestinian.htm\">declared</a> in 1997 that “our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians”. The African National Congress (ANC) had counted the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) as a close ally that had actively assisted in its work to free itself from the indignity and oppression of apartheid. With South Africa freed, by its own struggle and with international support, by the early 1990s, Mandela believed it was time to secure the rights of the Palestinians and of others fighting for self-determination.</p> \n<p>The relationship began in the 1960s when the ANC was part of the non-aligned movement and the more radical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/28/a-struggle-with-history\">Tricontinental conference</a> which committed itself to aid liberation movements still fighting for independence. It operated in a network of revolutionary movements in developing countries, some now in power, others still fighting for liberation. Its allies ranged from newly freed Angola and Mozambique to Cuba, Algeria, Ethiopia, Vietnam and beyond. But the Palestinians, stateless luminaries within that firmament of rebellion, always held a special place in the hearts of those who fought for liberation in South Africa. The reason is simply that both struggles faced violent settler-colonial regimes in close alliance with one another.</p> \n<p>Even as a teenage Zionist of the left in South Africa – before the illusions of that identity collapsed under the weight of their absurdity and I found my way into the ANC – my anti-apartheid inclinations made me especially uncomfortable that Israel was the apartheid regime’s closest ally. Many of us were appalled in 1976 when Israel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/07/southafrica.israel\">hosted South African prime minister John Vorster</a>, an avowed Nazi imprisoned during the second world war for his work in a paramilitary sabotage organisation linked to Hitler’s abwehr, his military-intelligence service. Even more so, later, when it turned out that Israel was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/07/southafrica.israel\">negotiating arms deals</a> with South Africa, which violated the UN arms embargo, and even cooperated on nuclear-weapons development.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"995add02-d709-4bf6-b0c3-5ff08e980db7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OBQMTvYUoVU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>My alarm deepened two years later when an acquaintance told me how he’d scored a plum posting during his South African military service. His fluency in Hebrew and Afrikaans, thanks to his Jewish day school education, landed him a staff position as a translator for the Israeli officers quietly seconded to the South African Defence Force.</p> \n<p>As early as 1978, I’d been told by ardent Zionists who’d emigrated from South Africa to a Habonim kibbutz that the permanent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza meant an apartheid system in which Israel ruled millions of Palestinians denied the rights of citizenship.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t hard, then, to see the link between parallel struggles against apartheid, and hope for a decolonisation that would, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/21/3\">Aimé Césaire </a>promised, redeem the humanity of both the coloniser and the colonised in a new community of belonging. The ANC was fighting to replace apartheid with a new state that guaranteed security, dignity, freedom and equality to all who live in it. And we supported the fight to replace Israeli apartheid with a new system guaranteeing those things to all who live between the river and the sea.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/south-africa-genocide-case-israel-apartheid-history\">How apartheid history shaped South Africa’s genocide case against Israel</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the third world politics of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Non-Aligned-Movement\">non-alignment</a> in which we had come of age was largely extinguished by the collapse of the<strong> </strong>Berlin Wall starting in 1989, and the onset of neoliberal US unipolarity. This was the era during which the US claimed exclusive, uncontested ownership of the international community’s Israel-Palestine file, batting away any attempt to seek Israeli compliance with international law as “unhelpful” to a chimeric “two-state solution”. Thus the origins of three decades of massively expanded apartheid occupation, and of the brazen impunity that undergirds Israel’s current war crime spree.</p> \n<p>Israel can count on unconditional US backing for its systemic criminality. And it feels comfortable following the example of its US mentor which flagrantly defied international law in its “war on terror” and Iraq invasion.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, then, South Africa’s solidarity at this point, US objections notwithstanding, also reflects the decline of Washington’s ability to enforce its unipolar hegemony. The genocide case against Israel in the international court of justice is thus a clarion call to the rest of the world that a values-based solidarity is once again an option. And that a different world order is possible.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Tony Karon is the AJ+ managing editor</p></li> \n <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The advertisers objected to their material being placed next to graphic and potentially illegal content, according to the filing.</p> <p>In early November, Match notified Meta that ads for its dating apps had appeared alongside “disturbing” content on Reels, short videos posted by users on Facebook and Instagram, according to the complaint. The company allegedly said it believed some of the content in the Reels “is clearly promoting illegal and exploitative businesses” and included provocative images of young girls. Match adverts were also featured in a Facebook Group titled “Only women are slaughtered”, which showed graphic films of women being murdered, according to the complaint.</p> <p>“We need to quickly figure out how we stop this from happening on your platforms,” a representative for Match wrote, according to one email quoted in the filing.</p> <p>When Meta failed to address these concerns, Match’s CEO, Bernard Kim, allegedly wrote to Zuckerberg himself, stating: “Meta is placing ads adjacent to offensive, obscene – and potentially illegal – content, including sexualization of minors and gender-based violence.” Kim’s letter also highlighted that Match spent millions of dollars on advertising on Meta but “our ads are being serviced to your users viewing violent and predatory content”, the complaint says. Zuckerberg did not respond to the letter, the legal complaint says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in October, Walmart emailed Meta with concerns that the tech giant’s “level of attention/consideration” to brand safety issues “has disappeared”.</p> <p>Meta confirmed that Walmart advertisements were being displayed on unapproved channels, responding that “there is some minimal exposure to placements that you’ve not approved”, according to the complaint. Walmart’s marketing representatives allegedly continued to question why their adverts were running next to illicit content, eventually becoming so frustrated that one called Meta’s response to the problem “unacceptable”.</p> <p>“Candidly, we were disappointed that your team seemed more focused on getting a press statement right than on addressing this problem,” one representative wrote, according to the complaint.</p> <p>Torrez wrote in the complaint: “The experiences of Match and Walmart are emblematic of a larger problem … Meta’s claims regarding the content of its platforms are false and that its tools are ineffective.”</p> <p>In response to the filing, Walmart said in a statement: “We take brand safety issues extremely seriously, and protecting our customers and communities will always be a top priority.”</p> <p>Meta and Match did not respond to request for comment by press time.</p> <p>The filing also contains new evidence that child predators are allegedly able to find victims through Instagram. It includes excerpts of users allegedly discussing how to lure minors into engaging with them, highlighting the absence of controls to prevent unknown adults from messaging minors on the social network. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/07/meta-facebook-employee-congress-testimony-instagram-child-harm-social-media\">former Instagram employee testified in November before Congress</a> that his own daughter had received unwanted online advances and that, when he notified senior Meta leadership, he was ignored.</p> <p>Before filing the lawsuit, investigators at the New Mexico attorney general’s office conducted their own investigation into child sexual exploitation taking place on Meta’s platforms. According to the lawsuit, they “found numerous posts and accounts on Instagram that depicted or promoted choking, slapping, tying up, engaging in sex with, and otherwise abusing little girls”.</p> <p>According to the filing, all of the images and videos the investigators found were reported to Meta. According to the suit, the company removed only half of the reported images.</p> <p>“Investigators found that content that was removed frequently reappeared or that Meta recommended alternative, equally problematic content to users – demonstrating both that Meta is capable of identifying this content but incapable of effectively dealing with it,” the lawsuit states.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Michael Gove has refused to set a deadline for an independent report on allegations of “corruption, wrongdoing and illegality” at Teesworks, the industrial development within the government’s high-profile freeport project.</p> <p>The levelling up secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/24/michael-gove-orders-review-into-corruption-allegations-at-teesside-freeport\">ordered a review</a> into financial dealings and governance at the joint venture between Tory Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen’s South Tees Development Corporation and companies run by two local developers.</p> <p>After political anger that Gove had declined to act on calls to bring in the National Audit Office to lead the investigation – instead announcing that it would be undertaken by an independent panel of his choosing – local MPs have criticised delays in the process before mayoral elections on Teesside in May.</p> <p>Gove said he hoped the inquiry would report before voters go to the ballot box, but refused to commit to a timeline under questioning from MPs on the Commons business committee on Wednesday.</p>    <p>“I always wanted it to be as quickly as possible, but it’s also important that it is comprehensive,” he said.</p> <p>The government had intended that the investigation, led by the chief executive of Lancashire county council, Angie Ridgwell, would be completed last summer. However, it was delayed until autumn, then winter, and then this coming spring.</p> <p>The north-east Labour MP Ian Lavery told Gove there was a “big feeling this has been kicked into the long grass because of the mayoral elections in Teesside” and asked the levelling up secretary to give a commitment that this was not the case.</p> <p>Gove said he could not “force the hand of an independent investigator” to hurry out a report and declined to commit to publication before the election.</p> <p>“The team know that we’d like them to report as quickly and comprehensively as possible,” he said. “Of course, no one wants it published more than Ben Houchen himself, because he wants the mayoral election to be about what he’s achieved, his record, his plans for the future, and for all of these issues to be out there, tackled, and people being able to make a judgment based on the facts.”</p>    <p>The questions for the government come after Teesworks reported that net profits had tripled last year to £54m, according to details first reported this week by the Financial Times. The venture had been transferred in late 2021 from a 50-50 public-private partnership, established in 2020, to majority private ownership, with two Teesside developers – Chris Musgrave and Martin Corney – increasing their stake to 90%.</p> <p>Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the business committee, said Teesworks’ accounts showed 110 acres of public land had been bought by a company 90% owned by “friends and close associates of Lord Houchen” for £1 an acre, resulting in the generation of profits “which have now largely gone out to these private shareholders”.</p> <p>Asking Gove if best value for taxpayers had been secured, he said: “A company that has bought 110 acres for £1 an acre is now turning over £143m and shovelling £50m out to private shareholders in profits.”</p> <p>The levelling up secretary said he could not “pre-empt” the outcome of the review, but argued he had full confidence in Houchen.</p> <p>“I have the highest regard for him,” he said. “In all of my observations and dealings with him, I think he’s a first-rate public servant who has been responsible for the economic transformation of the Tees valley, and he is a great and visionary leader in local government.”</p>",

Murder and violence linked to drug trafficking has soared, as the country has become one of the most dangerous in Latin America.</p> \n<p>Until just a few years ago, Ecuador was a corner of relative peace sandwiched between the world’s two biggest cocaine producers, Colombia and Peru, which have recently seen their own violent internal conflicts between security forces and nominally leftist rebels linked to the lucrative drugs trade.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/11/ecuador-presidential-candidate-killing-violence-drugs\">In Ecuador, a presidential candidate was assassinated. The tragedy is that no one was surprised | Jorge Núñez</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Facing its own surge in violence, Ecuador’s young president, Daniel Noboa, has declared a state of “internal armed conflict”, designating 20 drug trafficking gangs as terrorist groups and authorising Ecuador’s military to “neutralise” the crime factions “within the bounds of international humanitarian law”.</p> \n<p>That announcement came as Ecuador was plunged into chaos and bloodshed after the country’s most notorious gang leader and druglord, Adolfo Macías, alias Fito, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/ecuador-adolfo-macias-fito-missing-gang-leader\">escaped from prison on Sunday</a>. Noboa’s subsequent declaration of a state of emergency prompted criminals to unleash a wave of attacks inside and outside prisons which have seen police and prison guards murdered and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/ecuador-gangs-wave-terror-state-of-emergency\">a TV station invaded by armed gangsters during a live broadcast</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2db9ae1b-8de9-4bb2-bf15-760de78c1290\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QydZWvoE5ss?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ecuadoreans are terrified. Not so long ago Ecuador was better known for its volcanoes, its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/19/ecuador-prepares-for-once-in-a-lifetime-vote-to-stop-oil-drilling\">rich biodiversity</a> and even as a retirement retreat for US senior citizens enjoying the temperate climate and lower cost of living on their pensions.</p> \n<p>“We’ve never seen this before,” said Fernando Carrión, a security expert with the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito. “We always defined ourselves as an island of peace. But we saw this coming,” he added.</p> \n<p>The rate of violent deaths in the South American country in 2017 was five per 100,000 inhabitants, Carrión says. It is now 46, which “makes 2023 the most violent year in Ecuador’s history”, he said. According to police records, 2023 saw at least 7,592 violent deaths, compared with 4,426 in a year earlier.</p> \n<p>The latest explosion of violence is linked to the jailbreak not just of Macías but also of another gang leader, Fabricio Colón, who escaped prison during disturbances on Monday night. The prosecutor’s office has linked Colón, a leader of the Los Lobos gang, to the assassination of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/fernando-villavicencio-ecuador-assassinated-presidential-candidate\">presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio</a> last year and death threats against the attorney general, Diana Salazar.</p> \n<p>Never before have organised crime’s tentacles reached so far into the corridors of power, said Carrión, and now several gangs are rebelling against the new president’s tough approach as he attempts to shake up their control of the prisons, pledging to militarise jails, lengthen sentences and isolate powerful kingpins like those who just escaped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b03fa532-bfa2-4ef3-a343-7a879eb07529\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O1gEb3USJPQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Last week, Noboa pledged to follow the lead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/02/the-guardian-view-on-el-salvadors-crackdown-a-short-term-high-cost-fix\">El Salvador’</a>s president, Nayib Bukele, and construct two maximum security prisons using the same company and design as those built by the popular leader.</p> \n<p>Trapped between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/14/ecuador-presidential-election-violence-crime\">economic hardship, extortion rackets and the very real risk of being the victim of violent crime</a>, many Ecuadoreans have chosen to flee. Tens of thousands have risked it all, heading north via the perilous Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama, becoming the second largest nationality after Venezuelans to make the journey, according to <a href=\"https://www.migracion.gob.pa/images/img2023/pdf/TRANSITO_IRREGULAR_POR_DARIEN_OCTUBRE%202023.pdf\">Panama’s migration office</a>.</p> \n<p>It is Ecuador’s globalized economy – with access to markets in Asia and Europe but poor security controls in its ports – that has made it a hub for cocaine trafficking around the world, explained Renato Rivera of the Ecuadorian Observatory on Organised Crime. Ecuador exports around 1m containers a year, of which 75% are bananas, according to General Pablo Ramírez, the former police anti-narcotics director and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/german-supermarkets-cocaine-banana-crates-berlin\">trade provides the perfect cover for drug shipments.</a></p> \n<p>Much of Ecuador’s rising violence has been driven by competition between an expanding cluster of local crime gangs, who learned their brutally violent scare tactics from their backers, the rival Mexican drug cartels Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation.</p> \n<p>The gangs also do business with Balkan traffickers, who control the lucrative European market that has displaced the United States as the main destination for cocaine. The rival factions have learned urban guerrilla tactics from disbanded Colombian guerrilla groups, who, according to security experts, have branched out their drugs and crime businesses into neighbouring countries since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/24/colombia-signs-historic-peace-deal-with-farc-rebels\">2016 Colombia peace agreement</a>. </p> \n<p>Now, however, those bloodthirsty tactics are being turned against a common enemy – the Ecuadorian state.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>For at least a decade, television producers tried to tap the popularity of video games and digital interactivity for their programmes. In 2005, Channel 4 debuted its innovative series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/10/mondaymediasection.television3\">Dubplate Drama</a>, about an aspirational grime MC. After each episode, viewers could use text messaging to vote on where the story went next. Much later, Netflix explored similar territory with Interactive Specials, a set of choose-your-own-adventure shows and cartoons, featuring brands such as Black Mirror, Jurassic World and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. We’ve also seen countless companion apps for reality TV favourites, including Love Island and Love Is Blind.</p> <p>It was no surprise this week, then, to find the BBC announcing a new online game to accompany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/03/the-traitors-review-so-thrilling-it-will-make-you-gasp-and-yelp\">the second series of The Traitors</a>, the psychological reality gameshow, hugely inspired by the party game Werewolves and the hit game Among Us. For those who aren’t as addicted as me, the show sees 22 people locked in a Scottish castle and performing tasks to earn cash, while a group of “traitors” among the group slowly “murder” everyone else off. The drama of each episode is the round table, where the victims have to try to guess who the traitors are.</p>    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1xkdVgMSnTv981p8TbfJRY4/the-traitors-predictor-game\">The BBC’s Traitors online game</a> lets users vote on who they think will be banished in each episode, acquiring points for accurate predictions and competing in mini-leagues against pals. It’s the perfect synchronicity between programme content and interactive platform because the game simulates and makes literal the discussions and arguments players are already having around the series. What it doesn’t do is reproduce the deceit and concealment that’s central to the drama – you have to go to an actual board or video game for that.</p> <p>There are other experiments going on with screen brands right now. Netflix and Amazon have stumbled on a clever ruse to get the most out of expensive television properties – by turning them into reality TV gameshows. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/20/squid-game-the-challenge-review-netflix\">Squid Game: The Challenge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/10/007-road-to-a-million-review-brian-cox-is-so-bad-it-could-ruin-succession-for-you\">007: Road to a Million</a> transform the structural and thematic essences of their subject matter into showy versions of established gameshow formats such as Takeshi’s Castle and Race Across the World. Nobody in either show is going to be machine-gunned to death by a giant doll or murdered by a Russian spy, but housed within familiar locations and contexts, the usual gameshow elements of tension, failure and victory are massively heightened. The shows have been a big success and more streaming platforms might use reality TV spin-offs to help fund the expensive business of making and licensing epic TV dramas.</p>    <p>I hope, though, that more comes from these experiments than merely extra cash. The Traitors is the most fascinating reality TV concept in a decade, and its exploration of group dynamics and socio-psychological behaviour models should be required viewing for game developers. There are so few multiplayer games that actually require participants to interact with each other in authentic, complicated and duplicitous ways. It is no surprise to me that Among Us was such a hit during lockdown: it was the closest a video game came to actually simulating the reality of social interplay, the way people casually lie, seduce and manipulate. It wasn’t just company we were missing in those dark months – it was intrigue and drama.</p> <p>Let’s see more cooperative video games that put you at odds with your fellow players. Let’s see a survival horror game that combines Until Dawn and Saltburn. Game mechanics are being studied and utilised by TV and movie producers to create profitable new formats; video game creatives should, in return, learn from the things that high-end drama and popular reality TV do so well with psychology and human interplay. Too often in games, coop means cosy; it means helping each other to achieve common goals. The Traitors has interesting things to teach us about how much more fiendish we actually are.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>    <p>January can be unforgiving, so it’s just the right time for a sugary-sweet role-playing adventure with a warm nostalgic undertone.

I’ll opt for one of two Mega Drive titles, the brilliant platform adventure <strong>Quackshot</strong> with its luscious visuals and innovative plunger gun mechanic, or <strong>Comix Zone</strong>, one of the great idiosyncratic titles developed by the Sega Technical Institute (founded by Mark Cerny, who would go on to design the PlayStation 4).

            "body" : "<p>In every sense, Taylor Swift is an outlier. This week her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/13/taylor-swift-the-eras-tour-concert-film-review-a-cacophonous-testament-to-mega-stardom\">Eras Tour film</a> became the highest-grossing concert film in box office history, taking the record from Michael Jackson’s 2009 movie This Is It. She was the only artist who placed in the chart of the UK’s Top 10 albums of 2023 with a new album rather than an older one (albeit with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/27/taylor-swift-1989-taylors-version-review-republic\">re-recording of her 2014 pop breakthrough 1989</a>). Last year she became the first woman to have four albums in the US Top 10 at the same time, she took the record for the most US No 1 albums by a woman from Barbra Streisand, the Eras tour became the first ever to earn more than $1bn, and in October Swift herself was estimated to have become a billionaire. In November, a US publication hired a dedicated Swift reporter – though the joke is that everyone in entertainment media pretty much does the same job, given the wild scale of her success.</p> <p>But beyond commerce, Swift, 34, is also an outlier in terms of how she conducts her relationships with her fans and the public. She maintains an unusual level of control in a period when other pop superstars allow themselves to be the subjects of untrammelled interpretation and speculation – Harry Styles thrives on mystery; Beyoncé’s PR strategy appears to be never apologise, never explain – and understand how doing so might satisfy unexpected elements of one’s fanbase, or suggest surprisingly viable commercial paths. Swift rarely gives interviews – though more on that later – and her primary public relations strategy involves seeding fairly obvious clues for her fans to work out her next move, allowing them to feel like active participants in her work while almost always leading them to her desired conclusion. Puppet-mastery is a smart approach, especially for a star who tests the limits of overexposure – allowing her to remain plausibly out of the picture while perpetually in the spotlight and still on her terms.</p> <p>Occasionally, though, the velvet glove comes off and the tightness of the star’s grip on her narrative becomes felt when people draw the “wrong” conclusions. Last week, the New York Times published a 5,000-word comment piece speculating that Swift is secretly gay – as deduced from various lyrics and costuming choices – and suggesting that she owes it to queer fans and less privileged musicians to come out. These notions are not news to the Swift hardcore, a significant number of whom identify as “Gaylor” conspiracists, certain that she has dated women throughout her life. But fans gleefully cross-referencing lyrics and dates online – often seeking an affirmative reflection of their own desires – is one thing. A major global publication writing a prescriptive, even chastising, article seems both trivial and sinister – a good old-fashioned celebrity outing under the guise of social conscience, and one that unhelpfully essentialises sexuality to a behavioural code. And as a much better NYT comment piece on queerbaiting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/t-magazine/queer-baiting-harry-styles-bad-bunny.html\">put it last year</a>: “As self-serving as some celebrity caginess can be, you can’t build a world in which everyone feels free to self-identify by ordering everyone to self-identify.”</p> <p>Surprisingly, Swift’s usually invisible team – or “a person close to the situation”, as CNN reported – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/08/taylor-swift-nyt-opinion-sexuality\">hit back</a>. “Because of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people’s ethics,” they told CNN. “This article wouldn’t have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans. There seems to be no boundary some journalists won’t cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue and inappropriate it is – all under the protective veil of an ‘opinion piece’.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/08/taylor-swift-nyt-opinion-sexuality\">New York Times faces backlash for essay speculating on Taylor Swift’s sexuality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The response felt almost as heavy-handed and misguided as the original piece. Male artists including Shawn Mendes and Harry Styles have in fact been the subjects of massive speculation about their sexualities: the NYT writer previously published a similar piece about Styles, while Mendes has spoken of the pressure of the constant discourse about his identity. (“I thought, ‘You fucking guys are so lucky I’m not actually gay and terrified of coming out,’ ” <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/shawn-mendes-cover-interview-756847/\">he told Rolling Stone</a>. “That’s something that kills people.”) And there is no way that gimlet-eyed Swift has made the many references listed by accident: if you lead a horse to water, don’t be surprised when it drinks. Dignifying an overblown essay with such a severe response may in turn act as a rebuke to fans who have found identification and solace – or even just benign entertainment – in imagining, say, that Swift’s gaspingly sexy Reputation song Dress may be about her once-prominent friend, the model Karlie Kloss (“I don’t want you like a best friend”!), rather than its more likely subject, her then-boyfriend Joe Alwyn.</p>    <p>More than ever, pop stardom is an act of collective imagination. Swift may be one of the last monocultural stars – meaning your grandparents may have a passing awareness of who she is; her moves make tabloid headlines, not just niche gossip items, and prompt bland (but hardly offensive) jokes at awards ceremonies – but that monoculture is still a federation of distinct fanbases, each with their own interpretation of her. Thanks to social media, members of each of these Swiftian sub-tribes can find each other and imagine and inhabit their own version of her reality, forming community (if sometimes descending into entitlement). The Swift I enjoy is a little vindictive and surprisingly self-lacerating; others may value her loyalty to her friends, her honesty about her experiences with disordered eating, her goofiness, her assiduous capitalist instincts, or may have found in her some other prism through which to understand and appreciate some aspect of their identity – all of them valid parasocial relationships. Arguably, what Swift serves up is a constructed fiction with herself as the central character: why shouldn’t it compete with others?</p> <p>It’s these playful and personal mutations that keep a star like Swift interesting at a time when her carefully managed media omnipresence and tightly plotted breadcrumb trails have started to feel a little tedious, laden with thudding predictability. (Does the snake-green dress she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2024/jan/08/helen-mirren-gillian-anderson-and-more-2024-golden-globes-red-carpet-in-pictures\">wore to the Golden Globes</a> at the weekend mean that the serpent-referencing Reputation (Taylor’s Version) is coming? Is the pope Catholic?) For many onlookers, that wearying feeling struck again when reading her lone recent interview, for Time’s person of the year cover, which seemed disappointingly uninquiring and intent on validating her version of events – namely that she was “cancelled” in the wake of her feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, when in fact it resulted in one of the most successful albums of her career – rather than pushing deeper into the fertile ground where her self-conception rubs up against public interpretation. The most abiding images of Swift this past year show pop’s biggest outlier standing alone on stage at the Eras tour, bedazzled with sequins. She cuts a formidable figure in her class of one – but it’s in the unruly exquisite corpse of pop fandom and stardom that the most meaningful rewards are found.</p>",

Our intention is to celebrate the hard work and expertise of all involved, and we have now name-checked Philip on the footage that he provided of his find.”</p> <p>Jacobs, 69, who has been an avid fossil hunter for 40 years, spotted what at first appeared to be an odd-looking rock at Kimmeridge Bay in April 2022. When he looked closer, he knew it was the snout of a pliosaur. Rather than take the fossil home with him, Jacobs buried it, marked the spot with some driftwood and sought help.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theetchescollection.org/steves-story\">expert Steve Etches</a> helped unearth the rest of the pliosaur fossil. The specimen went on <a href=\"https://www.theetchescollection.org/giant-sea-monster\">display at the Etches Museum in Dorset</a> at the start of the month and has been a huge hit with visitors.</p> <p>The explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes was among those who criticised the BBC, saying: “It is an absolute disgrace that his gift to the world has been ignored and undermined, by the BBC … utterly shameful.”<br></p> <p><br></p>",

            "body" : "<p>“The most vulgar and barbarous habit the eccentric mind of fashion ever invented.” Thank you, 19th-century arbiter of social taste <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4316734?read-now=1&amp;seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents\">Ward McAllister</a>.</p> <p>With the dames Judi Dench and Helen Mirren on the bandwagon, it’s hard to see tattooed women as transgressive today. In some communities, they never were: tattooing practices were part of puberty rituals and <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/biology/native-american-tattoos/\">used for therapeutic purposes</a>, to commemorate milestones and to <a href=\"https://womenshistorynetwork.org/tattooed-women-a-misleading-notion-of-empowerment-and-agency/\">recognise kin in the afterlife</a>.</p> <p>But other tattooed women’s motivations were mysterious. A 3,000-year-old mummy discovered in Deir el-Medina, Egypt, in 2019 is <a href=\"https://journals.openedition.org/bifao/296\">adorned with seated baboons</a>, a cobra, cows and lotus blossoms. Archaeologists have puzzled over why. Was she a priestess, or a “magico-medical healer”? Were her tattoos the equivalent of protective amulets? Did she just really like baboons?</p> <p>Unpicking the truth about 19th- and early-20th-century western women’s tattoos is tricky, too. Tattooed ladies in circuses needed a good origin story; the more lurid, the better. Tales of frontier capture and kidnap were wildly popular. Nora Hildebrandt maintained <a href=\"https://vividinktattoos.co.uk/the-tattooed-ladies/#:~:text=Nora%20claimed%20that%20during%20her,the%20needle%20at%20one%20point.\">her father was forced to tattoo her</a> while they were being held by Sitting Bull. Some stories were even more out-there: Laura Laramie, a tattooed lady in Baltimore, reported giving birth to an identically tattooed baby, according to Margot Mifflin’s fascinating history of women’s tattoos, <a href=\"https://margotmifflin.com/books/bodies-of-subversion-3rd-edition/\">Bodies of Subversion</a>.</p> <p>The truth was more prosaic. Tattoos offered emancipation (circus life meant travel and adventure) and the potential of an excellent living. In the 1890s, a successful tattooed lady could earn <a href=\"https://youtu.be/G0KbNe46w8U?t=1056\">$100 to $200 a week</a>, when working-class families lived on $300 to $500 a year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in fin de siècle high society, getting a tattoo became fashionable <em>pour épater les bourgeois</em>,<em> </em>or to show how well-travelled you were. “In place of spending her spare time posing in front of the camera … the lady about town now consents to be pricked by the tattoo artist’s operating needle,” <a href=\"https://virtualvictorian.blogspot.com/2013/03/tattooed-by-royal-appointment.html\">marvelled an 1898 article</a>. In 1880, the New York Times claimed at least 7.5% of fashionable women in London “<a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/01/30/98882882.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;ip=0\">were tattooed in inaccessible localities</a>”; 17 years later, the New York World asserted that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/books/bodies-of-subversion-explores-womens-tattoos.html\">75% of American society women had a tattoo</a>.</p> <p>Regardless of popularity or motivation, there is a pleasing crackle of subversion about history’s tattooed ladies. “Women’s initial interest … came in the wake of feminism’s first wave in the late 19th century … a second craze crested in the suffragist 20s and women tattooists broke the gender barrier in the feminist 70s,” writes Mifflin. Boringly, wimpishly inkless, I find their pictures and stories as thrilling as any carnival sideshow punter. Let’s enjoy this, a rare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/shock-of-the-old\">Shock of the old</a> in which (almost) nothing terrible happens!</p> <h2>The Princess of Ukok</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: CPA Media/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>Discovered in the Siberian permafrost in 1993, this possible noblewoman or spiritual leader was buried in the fifth century BC with six horses and cannabis. The startlingly modern-looking tattoos along her arms include a deer with a griffin beak and Capricorn horns, plus a sheep with a snow leopard at its feet. She was recently credited with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0b5vtbj/the-mystery-of-siberia-s-2-500-year-old-ice-maiden-\">protecting the Altai region from Covid</a>, but also blamed for causing various natural disasters as retribution for her grave being disturbed. Swings and roundabouts.</p> <h2>Olive Oatman</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>Oatman’s was the original frontier-capture-tattoo narrative. It was partly true – her family were captured by Yavapai Indians in 1851, then she was traded to the Mohave before eventually being ransomed back to the US army – but the evidence suggests she assimilated happily. Mifflin says Oatman’s adoptive Mohave family probably tattooed her chin “to guarantee her passage to the afterlife”. It’s very unlikely that she was forced: captives were never tattooed and Oatman’s five parallel lines were perfectly straight (which would have been impossible to achieve if she had been wriggling). Later, Oatman toured the country telling her gripping, if inaccurate, tale of abuse and brutality, making her one of the first women to make a living from her tattoos.</p> <h2>Nora Hildebrandt</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>Hildebrandt beat her great rival Irene Woodward to the stage by a matter of weeks in 1882, but Woodward – younger, slimmer and more conventionally attractive – had the more enduring career (“natural beauty mattered in the business of manufactured freaks,” Mifflin writes). Hildebrandt didn’t do badly, though: on an 1884 tour in Mexico, she was <a href=\"https://womenshistorynetwork.org/tattooed-women-a-misleading-notion-of-empowerment-and-agency/\">given a pony, an eagle and a tiger</a>. Contrary to her lurid tale of capture by Sitting Bull, her 365 tattoos (including birds, flowers, and the word “liberty” on her leg) were completed by her common-law husband Martin, a popular tattooist.</p> <h2>Aimée Crocker</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>Crocker’s tattoos were among the tamer things about her. A railroad heiress known in the 1910s as “the Queen of Bohemia”, Crocker had five husbands, two of whom were Russian princes (they claimed) 20 years her junior. She once threw a party for “the Maharaja of Amber” without telling guests that the maharaja was her boa constrictor. She wrote about <a href=\"https://aimeecrocker.com/exploits/the-house-of-the-ivory-panels/\">a sexual encounter with a Chinese violin</a> in her magnificently titled autobiography <a href=\"https://aimeecrocker.com/who-is-aimee-isabella-crocker\">And I’d Do It Again</a>. During a decade spent travelling the world, she acquired a tattoo of a snake (of course) on her leg, a butterfly on her back and many more.</p> <h2>Emma de Burgh</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Bettmann Archive</p></li> </ul> <p>De Burgh and her husband, Frank, showed as <a href=\"https://www.sunnybuick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/emma-and-frank-590x551.jpg\">a tattooed couple</a>, inked with each other’s names. Religious and patriotic tattoos conferred a form of respectability; De Burgh’s motif of Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper was considered a particularly fine example (the eye on her elbow that could “wink” at observers sounds more fun). De Burgh’s career tanked as she became larger, with the pre-Raphaelite painter <a href=\"https://www.leicestergalleries.com/browse-artwork-detail/MTM3NDA=\">Edward Burne-Jones writing waspishly after sketching her</a> in 1893: “She had grown very stout … when I looked at the Last Supper, all the apostles wore broad grins.”</p> <h2>Maud Stevens</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Graphica Artis/Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>It was tough for tattooed ladies to move to the other side of the needle – the skills were jealously guarded by male tattooists. Stevens, a <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/maud-wagner\">contortionist and aerialist</a>, apparently persuaded her future husband, Gus Wagner, to teach her his stick-and-poke technique in exchange for a date after seeing him tattoo 1,900 people at the 1904 World’s Fair. Their daughter, Lotteva, joined the family business at nine. If Maud told you not to move, you would obey, wouldn’t you?</p> <h2>Princess Waldemar of Denmark</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Chronicle/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>The tattooing craze reached the arms, and other parts, of the crowned heads of Europe: “The Grand Duke Alexis of Russia is most elaborately tattooed. And Prince and Princess Waldemar of Denmark, Queen Olga of Greece, King Oscar of Sweden, the Duke of York, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lady Randolph Churchill,” <a href=\"https://virtualvictorian.blogspot.com/2013/03/tattooed-by-royal-appointment.html\">according to an 1898 report</a>. Tattoos were often a travel souvenir, gap year-style: the princess’s was “tattooed on her arm in the Far East”, where she had “many interesting experiences, visiting Chinese opium-dens”, the caption reads. She also liked <a href=\"https://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2009/12/princess-waldemar-of-denmark-dead.html\">driving trains and putting out fires</a> and sounds quite the gal.</p> <h2>Early cosmetic tattooing</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>Tattooed ladies retained a great deal of stigma well into the 20th century, partly thanks to skull-shape-obsessed 19th-century weirdo <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_48/April_1896/The_Savage_Origin_of_Tattooing\">Cesare Lombroso</a>, who called it a “wholly savage operation”.

            "body" : "<p>Just as when he drops back to pass, Aaron Rodgers scans the world around him and sees enemies everywhere. Over the past four years, The Pat McAfee Show, a streaming sensation <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/37664316/pat-mcafee-show-coming-espn-multiyear-deal\">that’s recently found a home on ESPN</a>, has provided a forum for the New York Jets quarterback to settle scores and single out other targets for offense – not least his grudge against Jimmy Kimmel.</p> <p>Rodgers’s three-year-old feud with Kimmel – which began with the talkshow host slamming Rodgers, a stubborn vaccine skeptic, after he tested positive for Covid – reached a troubling inflection point last week when Rodgers appeared on McAfee’s show and implied the comedian was “nervous” about being linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The quarterback pledged to “pop a bottle of something” if Kimmel’s name surfaced in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/05/jeffrey-epstein-documents-unsealed\">the recent release of documents</a> related to the disgraced financier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/08/from-no-1-to-nowhere-was-trevor-lawrence-to-blame-for-the-jags-playoff-flop\">From No 1 to nowhere: was Trevor Lawrence to blame for the Jags’ playoff flop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That led to Kimmel hopping on X to reject any connection to Epstein (Kimmel was not named in any documents related to Epstein) and threaten Rodgers with a lawsuit. He then hammered Rodgers on his late-night chatshow in <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/mike-freeman/2024/01/09/jimmy-kimmel-new-monologue-destroys-aaron-rodgers/72157754007/\">a seven-minute monologue</a> that painted Rodgers as a special case of dumb jock. “Aaron got two As on his report card, and they were both in the word ‘Aaron,’” Kimmel snarked.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Rodgers appeared on McAfee’s show and unloaded both barrels. He shrugged off the Kimmel broadside (“I think it’s impressive that a man who went to Arizona State and has 10 joke writers can read off a prompter”) and claimed he was misunderstood (“I’m not calling him [a pedophile]”). Things quickly spiraled from there.</p> <p>Rodgers circled back to old grievances. He picked up his rants against mask requirements, federal vaccine mandates and the “pharmaceutical-industrial complex” – a helluva phrase for sports TV. He touted alternative treatments for Covid, questioned the safety of vaccines, maligned the US’s pandemic response czar Anthony Fauci as “one of the biggest spreaders of misinformation” (ignoring his own efforts) and recommended viewers read a takedown tome on the doctor by Robert F Kennedy Jr, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/09/robert-f-kennedy-jr-siblings-presidential-campaign\">a noted conspiracy theorist</a>. Throughout, Rodgers humble-bragged about his appetite for reading as if he was the first person to discover books and raged against the small-minded who’d sooner take medical advice from professionals than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/22/ayahuasca-48-touchdowns-mvp-rodgers-says-psychedelics-helped-nfl-career\">sip ayahuasca on “darkness” retreats</a>. All the while, none of Rodgers’s takes – which ranged from bizarre to dangerous – seemed to connect with many of McAfee’s viewers. “This guy is fucking exhausting with his BS,” one X user huffed.</p> <p>Still, Rodgers kept going. He dismissed sportswriters as beneath him, derided ESPN.com as clickbait farm and took swipes at ESPN executive Mike Foss, who last week called Rodgers’s Epstein crack at Kimmel a “dumb and factually inaccurate joke.”</p> <p>“I don’t even know who that is,” Rodgers said of Foss on Tuesday. “I don’t work for you, Mike!”</p> <p>That ESPN would allow one of the NFL’s most prominent faces to go full QAnon for the better part of a half hour – peppering the daytime schedule with f-bombs that the censor in charge of the bleeper missed – would seem a marked departure for a network that once harshly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/oct/18/espn-kneels-jemele-hill\">punished employees for not sticking to sports</a> at all times. But the Pat McAfee Show is unlike any other ESPN production, with relaxed dress code and language standards. “The opinions expressed on this show do not necessarily reflect the beliefs of their peers, their boss, or ESPN,” goes the show disclaimer, a new wrinkle for ESPN. “There may be some ‘cuss’ words because that’s how humans in the real world talk … PS: Don’t sue us.”</p> <p>McAfee is a livewire former NFL punter who played alongside Peyton Manning in Indianapolis and is widely admired for his lack of filter. His deadpan sidekick, former linebacker AJ Hawk, won a Super Bowl with Rodgers in Green Bay. Neither the show’s jock stars nor its Greek chorus of fanboy sycophants are especially inclined to push back on much, if anything, their guests say. After Rodgers’s first wind, McAfee made a great show of closing out the controversies and moving on to football matters, only to bring up Fauci unprompted during a discussion on the Steelers’ playoff chances, prompting Rodgers to spout off all over again. None of this was new: Rodgers has repeatedly attacked Fauci on McAfee’s show in the past. So it was no surprise that when Jets beat reporters asked him during Monday’s exit interview what the team needed to avoid another sub-.500 finish next season, many fans rolled their eyes <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-on-jets-season-bullsh-t-that-has-nothing-to-do-with-winning-has-to-get-out-of-the-building/\">when Rodgers said</a> “flush the bullshit” and eliminate “anything in this building that we’re doing individually or collectively that has nothing to do with real winning.”</p> <p>Rodgers’s appearances with McAfee in particular played a large part in establishing the show’s credibility, especially during the quarterback’s back-to-back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021. He helped extend the show’s reach to ESPN, which acquired the program last May in a five-year licensing deal worth $85m in the hope of tapping into McAfee’s younger, bro-skewing audience. When McAfee gave up <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/indianapolis-colts/pat-mcafee-5714/cash-earnings/\">his $2.5m a year football salary</a> in 2017 to launch a media career with Barstool Sports, ESPN’s Michael Wilbon believed the punter was making a grave mistake. “Somebody needs to stage an intervention [for McAfee],” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoePompliano/status/1358234192572735488\">the PTI host said</a>. “People who know this guy, get to him <em>now</em>.” Seven years later McAfee hasn’t just become a mainstay at the Worldwide Leader (moonlighting on First Take and College GameDay when he isn’t hosting his own show), he has eclipsed Wilbon’s influence at the network and, perhaps, top dog Stephen A Smith as well.</p> <p>To wit: last week McAfee got away with calling Norby Williamson, one of ESPN’s most powerful senior executives, a “rat” and “old hag” who was actively “trying to sabotage us” to a combined live TV and streaming audience of close to one million viewers. (In addition, The McAfee Show has almost 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube alone.) “No one is more committed to and invested in ESPN’s success than Norby Williamson,” the network said in a statement. “At the same time, we are thrilled with the multi-platform success that we have seen from The Pat McAfee Show across ESPN.”</p> <p>Last October, McAfee admitted to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/10/12/pat-mcafee-show-has-paid-aaron-rodgers-over-1-million-for-appearances-report-says/\">paying Rodgers “over $1m”</a> for his appearances on his show. In exchange the quarterback gets a safe space on air to rival the home field advantage he once enjoyed at Lambeau Field, and because he’s merely a guest on The McAfee Show, ESPN have no control over him. Bryan Curtis, the media critic at The Ringer, summed up the train wreck thusly: “Nobody involved in this story works for anybody, apparently. So no one at ESPN can step in and say, ‘Please stop.’”</p> <p>It’s telling that ESPN brass didn’t publicly object to anything Rodgers has said – and he had been airing unfounded Covid chatter for months on McAfee’s show – until the quarterback used their network to launch sneak attacks at Kimmel and his ABC show, even as the networks in play here are both Disney-owned. ESPN is now faced with a dilemma: let McAfee continue to give Rodgers a platform for his diatribes in the future, or cut ties with the show and confirm the quarterback – and much of America’s view – that shadowy forces are out to silence the “real truth tellers”.</p> <p>It wasn’t so long ago that Rodgers was one of the league’s sharper personalities, a grounded superstar who could just as easily talk shop as <a href=\"https://www.nbc26.com/sports/green-bay-packers/listen-with-an-open-heart-aaron-rodgers-speaks-up-following-george-floyd-protests\">hold forth on his Black peers’ right to protest</a> in between shifts as a guest host on Jeopardy! and his public romances with Danica Patrick and Shailene Woodley. But the more he prattles on with McAfee, the more he reveals himself as a thin-skinned egomaniacal contrarian who delights in starting fires and spreading misinformation. The disturbing truth is that many viewers will agree with Rodgers and pick up his “research” on Covid and Fauci. At best McAfee didn’t challenge Rodgers. At worst he kept running with the quarterback’s most dangerous handoff yet. On Wednesday, even McAfee seemed to have had enough for the time being: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatMcAfeeShow/status/1745132351913386149\">he announced Rodgers</a> won’t appear on his show again this season.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>Politicians from Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, including a personal aide to its leader Alice Weidel, met the head of the rightwing extremist Identitarian Movement and neo-Nazi activists to discuss a “masterplan” for mass deportations in the event of the party coming to power, it has been reported.</p> <p>The meeting, which was first reported on Wednesday by the investigative outlet Correctiv, took place last November at a countryside hotel on the outskirts of Potsdam. It is likely to feed a fraught debate over whether the AfD should be banned due to growing concerns that it poses a fundamental threat to German democracy.</p> <p>Buoyed up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/09/germany-afd-far-right-party-state-elections-support\">discontent over immigration</a>, the AfD is polling in first place in all five of Germany’s eastern states, three of which are holding elections later this year. While both the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal, pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) have, for now, ruled out entering coalitions with the party, its presence at the meeting suggests a far-right organisation with its eye on political gains in the near future.</p>    <p>Invitations seen by Correctiv and the Guardian describe the meeting as an opportunity to present “an overall concept in the sense of a masterplan”. The meeting was attended not only by two state and municipal-level AfD politicians but also one active member of the Bundestag, Gerrit Huy, as well as Roland Hartwig, a former MP who has acted as a personal aide to Weidel since September 2022. One party branch of the AfD’s has <a href=\"https://www.afd-rbk.de/dr-roland-hartwig-kurz-zurueck-zu-hause/\">described</a> Hartwig as being tasked with the party’s “strategic positioning”.</p> <p>The AfD figures were meeting with Martin Sellner, who was tasked with introducing the “masterplan” and is a key figure in the pan-European “New Right” and who, in 2019, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/26/anti-muslim-extremist-martin-sellner-permanently-excluded-from-entering-uk\">permanently barred</a> from entering the UK because of his extremist views. The Identitarian Movement, whose Austrian branch Sellner used to lead, openly opposes the idea of multicultural societies and expounds the conspiracy theory of a “great replacement” to replace Europe’s white population with people from Africa and the Middle East.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/07/far-right-germany-afd-minorities\">With the far right on the rise, it’s a bad time to live in Germany – but a worse time to leave | Fatma Aydemir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Identitarian Movement is on a <a href=\"https://www.afd.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Unvereinbarkeitsliste-Mitgliedschaft-AfD-2023_12_18.pdf\">list of organisations</a> whose membership the AfD considers incompatible with party membership, and the party has denied ties to the movement in the past. However, in recent years the AfD has done little to distance itself from the activist network.</p> <p>One key idea that Sellner has been trying to nudge into the political mainstream is “re-migration”: the forceful return of migrants to their countries of origin via mass deportations. Such deportations would target not only asylum seekers but, as Sellner elaborated in a recent article for the New Right journal Sezession, also citizens holding German passports who, he claims, “form aggressive, rapidly growing parallel societies”.</p> <p>According to Correctiv’s account, the explosive subject of “re-migration” apparently dominated the discussions between AfD politicians and rightwing extremist activists, with Sellner allegedly presenting the forcible extradition of “non-assimilated” German citizens as the biggest “challenge” if the AfD were to gain power.</p>    <p>Ideas discussed at the meeting, according to Correctiv, included that of deportations to an unnamed state in northern Africa that would provide space for up to 2 million people. People who lobby on behalf of refugees in Germany could also go there, Sellner is reported to have suggested.</p> <p>In a statement sent to the Guardian, Sellner confirmed he had presented the idea of “re-migration” at the meeting but said it was not about a “secret masterplan” and his comments had been shortened and taken out of context.</p> <p>During the meeting, Sellner said, he had made it “unmistakably clear that no distinction can be made between different types of [German] citizens – that there must be no second-class citizens – and that all re-migration measures have to be legal”.</p> <p>“Remigration also includes not only deportations, but also local assistance, <em>Leitkultur </em>[‘guiding culture’] and pressure to assimilate. The demand is part of an alternative migration and family policy, the aim of which is to control immigration so that it does not exceed Germany’s reception limits.”</p> <p>Huy, the AfD Bundestag delegate, is reported to have claimed that she developed her own “re-migration” concept, and appeared to suggest her party no longer opposed the government’s plan to lift a ban on dual citizenship for that reason. “Then you can take away the German [citizenship], and they still have one,” she is alleged to have said at the meeting. Currently it is illegal under German law to strip people of citizenship if it means they would then become stateless.</p> <p>In a phone call with the Guardian, Huy confirmed her attendance of the meeting and that the discussion of “re-migration” was on the agenda. “In 2017, I presented my party association chairman with plans for a re-migration programme for non-German nationals who can’t find their way into the labour market, which were not picked up by the party,” Huy said. “I still stand by those proposals.”</p> <p>Huy said she could not remember if plans for the removal of German nationals were also part of the discussions at the Potsdam meeting. Her comments on dual citizenship, she said, “were clearly meant as a joke”.</p> <p>Contacted by Correctiv and the Guardian, neither Weidel nor Hartwig commented on the report. The AfD confirmed that Hartwig had been at the meeting but said the reported proposals were not party policy. </p> <p>“The AfD won’t change its position on immigration policy because of a single opinion at a non-AfD meeting,” the party told Reuters.</p>    <p>The AfD’s gradual transformation from an economically liberal, anti-euro party into what many believe to be a far-right outfit is not new. In the three eastern states where the party could triumph at elections this year – Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia – the party has been classified as “certified rightwing extremist” by the German domestic spy agency, allowing its covert surveillance and potentially even infiltration. The party, however, denies that it is extremist.</p> <p>Postwar Germany defines itself as a “militant democracy”, and its constitutional court can shut down political parties if they pursue anti-constitutional goals – and are in a position to achieve these goals. In recent weeks, some politicians, such as the co-leader of Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SDP), have called for a debate about whether the constitutional court should consider such a ban for the AfD.</p> <p>Others, including the SPD’s federal commissioner for the east, Carsten Schneider, have said that such a move could backfire by further radicalising AfD supporters, especially if the constitutional court were to reject a ban.</p> <p>In practice, the bar for outright party bans is relatively high. In 2017, Germany’s top constitutional court ruled that even though the radical-right NPD resembled Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party, it would not be banned because it did not pose a sufficient threat to democracy.</p>",

Yarl, who also plays the saxophone, has previously spoken of how music helped him during his recovery from the shooting.

Lester, a retired aircraft mechanic, then came to the door and, according to Yarl, said, “Don’t come here ever again.”</p> <p>“I hear the door open. I see this old man, and I’m assuming, ‘Oh, this must be like their grandpa,’ and then he pulls out his gun, and I’m like, whoa!” Yarl told ABC News.</p> <p>“So I back up. He points it at me. So I kind of, like, brace and I turn my head. I’m thinking there’s no way he’s actually going to shoot, right? The door [isn’t] even open. He’s going to shoot through his glass door and glass is going get everywhere? And then it happened.”</p> <p>Yarl said that he was bleeding from his head and tried to seek help from a neighbor across the street, who declined to help. He had to knock on the door of multiple houses before someone opened the door and told him to wait for the police.</p> <p>The teenager subsequently underwent neurological surgery for the injuries he received. He has said that he suffers lingering effects, saying his “mind is just foggy, like I can’t concentrate on the things that would be easy for me to do”.</p> <p>Lester told police that he believed someone was attempting to break into his house and that he grabbed a gun to protect himself. Missouri is a “stand your ground” state where people can use deadly force if they reasonably believe they are at risk of violent attack.</p> <p>In August, a Missouri judge ordered that Lester stand trial for the shooting. At the hearing, several people in the courtroom were wearing shirts that read ‘Justice for Ralph’ and ‘Ringing a doorbell is not a crime’. Lester has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action and was released on a $200,000 bond.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A Calvin Klein advertisement featuring the British singer FKA twigs has been banned by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority, on the grounds that it presented her as “a stereotypical sexual object”.</p> <p>The poster featured the singer with a shirt draped across her body, revealing part of one breast and the side of her buttocks, along with the caption “Calvins or nothing”.</p> <p>Two people complained about the image, arguing it inappropriately sexualised her. The ASA agreed, saying in a statement: “The ad used nudity and centred on FKA twigs’ physical features rather than the clothing, to the extent that it presented her as a stereotypical sexual object”, and said the “image’s composition placed viewers’ focus on the model’s body rather than on the clothing being advertised”.</p> <p>The ASA also described the advert as “irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence”. Their ruling states that the ad, which first appeared in April 2023, “must not appear again in the form complained of.”</p>    <p>The two complainants also objected to a pair of Calvin Klein adverts featuring the model Kendall Jenner, but the ASA deemed them acceptable, saying one of her holding her breasts was not done “in a manner that portrayed her as a sexual object”, and the other fell within the bounds of acceptable lingerie advertising.</p> <p>Calvin Klein has defended the FKA twigs advert, saying: “The images were not vulgar and were of two confident and empowered women who had chosen to identify with the Calvin Klein brand, and the ads contained a progressive and enlightened message.” They argued the poses adopted by both her and Jenner were “natural and neutral”.</p> <p>They also highlighted that FKA twigs and Jenner collaborated with the company and approved the images, and subsequently told interviewers “they felt a sense of empowerment and confidence from having participated”. Calvin Klein also highlighted that male models featured in the same campaign.</p> <p>FKA twigs, who has frequently celebrated her sexuality and femininity in her music and live performance, has not commented on the ban.</p> <p>Last month she gave an update on her next album, writing on Instagram that she had been making it “in cabs in berlin, huts in big sur, caves in ibiza, roads in hackney, i have written lyrics by lakes in prague and in the toilets of raves with a biro on the back of my hand”. It will be the follow-up to her 2022 mixtape Caprisongs, and her two studio albums, LP1 (2014) and Magdalene (2019).</p>",

            "body" : "<p>At about 2pm local time on Tuesday, a live news broadcast on an Ecuadorian TV channel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/ecuador-gangs-wave-terror-state-of-emergency\">was interrupted by a group of masked men carrying guns</a>, grenades and sticks of dynamite. The intruders pointed guns at employees and made them lie on the floor. “Don’t shoot, please don’t shoot,” one person shouted. One of the attackers said the attack was the result of “messing with the mafias”. The TC Televisión broadcast continued for at least 15 minutes. Then the signal was cut off.</p> <p>Thirteen gunmen were later arrested, and the hostages taken to safety. The astonishing scenes in the city of Guayaquil were part of a series of audacious coordinated attacks by members of Ecuadorian gangs that have killed at least 10 people. They follow the prison escape of the country’s most feared gang leader, Adolfo Macías, and the new president, Daniel Noboa’s subsequent declaration of a state of emergency. And while the situation is evolving rapidly, it appears to represent a declaration of war on the country’s fragile democratic institutions.</p> <h2>What happened on Tuesday?</h2> <p>As well as the attack on the TV studio, a series of apparently related incidents took place across Ecuador. At least seven police officers were kidnapped. A vehicle was set ablaze at a petrol station in the capital, Quito. Explosives were used in further attacks in the provinces of Esmereldas and Los Ríos. There was a jailbreak in the city of Riobamba. Five hospitals were also taken over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/ecuador-map/giv-13425OjnTGmMaUtSm/\" data-alt=\"A map showing the location of Guayaquil\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/ecuador-map/giv-13425OjnTGmMaUtSm/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>All of this followed riots in at least six jails on Monday, with guards taken hostage and threatened with death if soldiers were deployed to take control. Videos disseminated on WhatsApp purported to show guards being lynched, though they were unconfirmed.</p> <p>As schools, shops and public buildings closed down, the streets were in gridlock as people fled to the safety of their homes. Noboa declared a state of emergency. “We are not going to negotiate with terrorists,” he said.</p> <p>The response from the gangs was unambiguous. In one prison video, a guard read out a message with a gun pointed at his head. “You declared war, you will get war,” he said. “You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war.”</p> <h2>Who did this, and why?</h2>    <p>The immediate spark for the chaos of the last couple of days was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/ecuador-adolfo-macias-fito-missing-gang-leader\">the escape on Sunday of Macías, alias Fito</a>, from his cell in the prison complex in Guayaquil, the country’s largest city and its chief port.</p> <p>Macías is the leader of Los Choneros, one of the most powerful criminal gangs in Ecuador, which is believed to have links to Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel. He was serving a 34-year prison sentence, and previously escaped for several weeks in 2013.</p> <p>He was said to have been tipped off shortly before he was due to be transferred to a maximum-security facility. Macías was living in a spacious cell decorated with murals and had been <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vg98ylLkPp8?si=_B79IS0PdHAmFNVw\">shown in a music video</a>, for The Lion’s Ballad, relaxing in the prison courtyard and petting a fighting cockerel.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Noboa decreed 22 gangs were now classified as terrorist groups. </p> <h2>How strong are gangs in Ecuador?</h2> <p>Four months ago, Dan Collyns, who is covering the crisis for the Guardian, reported from Guayaquil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/12/ecuador-violence-bloody-drug-war\">on Ecuador’s “nightmarish descent into violence”</a> in recent years. The gangs have operated with impunity within the prison system and used jails as bases for their operations.</p> <p>There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/02/ecuadorian-prisons-guards-police-hostage-released\">a mass hostage-taking</a> in six prisons in September and a wave of violence including car bombs and a dynamite attack on a bridge after a senior gang leader was transferred to a new jail. The increase in violence led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/ecuador-presidential-candidate-fernando-villavicencio-killed\">the assassination of presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio</a>, who was shot dead in August as he left a campaign event. Villavicencio was an anti-corruption candidate who had accused Los Choneros and Macías of threatening him in the days before he was killed.</p> <p>The murder rate in Ecuador has jumped almost 500% since 2016, with police attributing 80% of the killings to gangs, <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/ecuador/ecuadors-high-tide-drug-violence\">according to the thinktank International Crisis Group</a>, one of the highest rates in the world. Local news reports regularly describe beheadings, public hangings and police assassinations as rivals vie for control of the drug trade.</p> <p>The increase in gang violence has been attributed to the killing of Los Choneros’ previous leader, Jorge Zambrano, in 2020. That sparked a struggle for control over drug-trafficking routes and territory. At least 400 inmates have died in the country’s prisons since 2021.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cartels from as far afield as Albania <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/world/americas/ecuador-drug-cartels.html\">have sought a piece of the Ecuadorian drug trade</a> and are financing local operations. Central to the chaos has been the export of cocaine, a major source of wealth for Ecuador’s gangs because of increased cultivation in neighbouring Colombia and years of lax policing.</p> <h2>How has the government responded to the violence?</h2>    <p>Noboa, the 35-year-old heir to a banana fortune, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/daniel-noboa-wins-ecuador-presidential-election\">won the presidency in October</a> after Villavicencio’s assassination. The centre-right politician pledged a hard line on gang violence. Shortly after Noboa took office, Jaime Enrique SC, the alleged leader of the Los Choneros splinter group Los Lobos, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-67509693\">was arrested</a>. That was viewed as a statement of intent and prompted reprisals against local police.</p> <p>Other measures included a policy of naming judges and prosecutors who release captured gang members, and the construction of new maximum-security prisons. Last week, Noboa announced plans for a referendum on further action including an expanded role for the military. In December, he proclaimed the success of his strategy, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuadors-noboa-says-unnamed-criminal-group-has-asked-peace-deal-2023-12-06/\">saying in an interview</a>: “We have captured leaders of criminal groups in recent weeks, from the most important [groups]. One of the groups … has even asked for a peace deal.”</p> <p>But the events of this week suggest that such optimism has been premature. After the TV station was stormed, Noboa said Ecuador was now in a state of “internal armed conflict”.</p>",

This is below the independently verified living wage of £10.90 that existing staff get.</p> <p>Pay for workers outside London will increase to £11.44 an hour from 1 April, in line with the new legal minimum for those aged 21 and over. However, that will be below the new real living wage of £12 an hour that accredited employers pledge to pay from April.</p> <p>In the capital there will be no increase in the minimum pay offered by BrewDog from April, with the rate for bar staff staying at £11.95 an hour, well below the £13.15 London real living wage being introduced that month. Living costs have increased in the city, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/dec/11/tenants-in-britain-hit-by-highest-increase-in-rent-for-a-decade-last-month\">rents soaring last year</a>.</p> <p>Workers reacted with anger on the group’s internal messaging system, with one saying: “I’ve been at BrewDog long enough to see every benefit that attracted me to the job either binned or completely reduced.</p> <p>“The effective cutting of our pay again when cost of living is only getting worse, especially in the city that is home to the business’s flagship bar, by a company that prides itself on its ethical ‘underdog’ image and supposed moral values is wildly questionable on both ethical and moral grounds.”</p> <p>Another member of staff told the Guardian: “Last year there was a staff vote surrounding benefits and what staff want to keep. No 1 was the real living wage. Barely a year later and they’ve turned back on their promise.”</p> <p>Bryan Simpson, the lead organiser on hospitality at the Unite union, said: “BrewDog has been paying the real living wage since 2015. To withdraw it now, during the most acute cost of living crisis in a generation is outrageous.</p> <p>“We are already working with our BrewDog members across the country to collectively challenge this awful decision and force the senior management of the company to do the right thing by the workers who have made them millions.”</p> <p>The Punks with Purpose campaign group of former staff said: “BrewDog management’s decision to revoke a long-standing commitment to the real Living Wage proves that there is no principle too dearly held for them to abandon. ”</p> <p>The group also criticised the dropping of Brewdog’s scheme in which 50% of a bar’s profits were shared with staff. However, the company says that scheme was changed to a 10% profit share and £1 per hour bonus for good customer service after a staff vote last year.</p> <p>Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: “We are disappointed that Brewdog have chosen to stop paying the real Living Wage. The independently calculated real Living Wage is the only UK wage rate based on the cost of living and it is voluntarily paid by over 14,000 organisations. Despite tough economic times, it’s been heartening to see record numbers of businesses join the movement.”</p> <p>BrewDog told workers it was making the “important but necessary … hard decisions” on pay despite a good festive period for the business.</p> <p>“Even with this strong performance over Christmas, as a wider business there is no hiding from the fact that in 2023 we made a trading loss and despite many efforts in the past 12 months to reduce our spending we still need to find more ways to get this business back to profitability and the financial stability that is needed. Inevitably, this does mean making some hard decisions,” the company wrote.</p> <p>A spokesperson for BrewDog said: “Despite unprecedented challenges in the hospitality sector – our staff outside London will be getting a 4.95% increase in base pay, and crew currently working in London will be paid 4.5% above the national living wage.</p> <p>“We have always been fully committed to doing the best we can for our people, and our benefits package is far more generous than the industry average.</p> <p>“Last year we gave over £350,000 to our bars team via our unique profit share programme. Our team also benefits from a unique bonus scheme which sees all crew members receive an additional £1 an hour for the month for surpassing customer service standards.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, BrewDog is thought to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/04/five-firms-to-watch-in-a-time-of-turbulence-humanforest-brewdog-saatchi-daaci-genflow\">considering a stock market flotation</a>.</p> <p>In 2021, staff accused the company’s chief executive and co-founder, James Watt, of presiding over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/10/brewdog-staff-craft-beer-firm-letter\">“culture of fear”</a> in which workers were mistreated. The company disputed some of the allegations, apologised for others, and in 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/01/brewdog-loses-its-ethical-b-corp-certificate#:~:text=The%20controversial%20beer%20brand%20BrewDog,the%20environment%2C%20community%20and%20staff.\">lost its B Corp status</a>, which offers certifies a company’s ethical commitment to the environment, community and staff.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>My father once told me some advice he’d been given by his teachers at boarding school in mid-century rural France. The school had an enormous library of old books and the boys were encouraged to read at least two hours a day. “The advice,” he said, “was that if after the first 50 pages of a book you don’t get hooked, you’re allowed to stop reading and try again later when you feel ready for it.”</p> <p>My father credits this advice with igniting his lifelong love of literature. Because he spent his entire working life as a manual labourer, books for him have always belonged to a private, mostly domestic and almost sacred realm. I’ve never seen anyone read the way my father reads. He is the most compulsive and prolific reader I know.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/13/i-was-feeling-anxious-and-an-imposter-then-my-buddy-said-judge-yourself-by-your-friends\">I was feeling anxious and an imposter, then my buddy said: ‘Judge yourself by your friends’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I don’t think my father intended to hand the 50-page guideline down to me. He’s not the sort to give advice and I’m not the sort to invite it. But I find it’s the advice that’s delivered obliquely that is most likely to be listened to.</p> <p>I like this rule of thumb, for the generosity and respect it extends to a book’s author. A reader, it suggests, needs a little patience to adapt to a book’s particular tone, rhythm and voice. But at the same time, this advice gives a person permission to stop reading. Nobody, it implies, need force themselves to slog through a book they’re not connecting to.</p> <p>I particularly like the gentle suggestion to return to a book “when you feel ready for it”. It’s a recognition that reading is inherently relational and that this relationship is not static. A couple of Christmases ago my father gave me a hardcover, annotated copy of Mrs Dalloway, but try as I might I can’t penetrate it. I feel a slight shame at this, but I try to heed his advice and remember I just need to give it time.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories\">Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Recently, the advice has meant I’ve stuck with and come to devour Jon Fosse’s single-sentence The Other Name; Marie Darrieussecq’s fragmented The Baby; and a string of John Banville novels, in his famously dense and lavish prose.</p> <p>Even when my initial instincts are correct and by page 50 I’m more than ready to stop reading, still the exercise feels worth doing. A bit like how I have strong legs on account of cycling, but swimming will use different muscles and I’m surprised every time at how my legs will hurt in new places. On both accounts, it’s a satisfying kind of hurt.</p> <p>I like to think my father’s readerly advice can be applied to life more generally, and to other people, too. Give things a fair chance; don’t judge too hastily. It’s helped me when travelling, when confronted with underwhelming landscapes, unanticipated delays and awkward social situations. Resisting the urge to escape, or to complain, or to dismiss, has meant I’ve come to appreciate the particular charm of a wide variety of places and personalities.</p> <p>And the flipside of my father’s advice is helpful too: when something doesn’t feel right, don’t be afraid to relinquish it, at least for the time being. For me, this has meant listening carefully to my instincts and not feeling pressure to enjoy every location, nor to force a connection with someone I know in my heart I don’t entirely trust.</p>",

One of the key performance indicators of the fund is higher wages for employees with disability.</p> <p>The plan does not outline a specific strategy for phasing employees with disability off subminimum wages or address the existing superannuation disparity.</p> <p>Catherine McAlpine, the chief executive of Inclusion Australia, said while Rishworth was to be commended for “not putting [supported employment] in the too-hard basket” and getting a plan together that acknowledges human rights for people with disability, the substance of the plan itself was “underwhelming”.</p> <p>“It’s disappointing that the government hasn’t made a clear declaration about genuinely increasing the wages of people with an intellectual disability,” McAlpine said. “I would encourage the government to be clear in acknowledging that the very low wages for people with an intellectual disability is a breach of their human rights and commit to finding a solution.</p> <p>“I would be disappointed if the government didn’t take immediate action to ensure that people with intellectual disability or people that work in ADEs received the same level of superannuation as the rest of the community.”</p> <p>While the plan is explicitly intended for people in supported employment, many of the initiatives are not targeted directly to people with intellectual disabilities – the largest cohort working under those conditions – and who need solutions tailored for their specific needs, McAlpine said.</p> <p>“There is a huge diversity in disability and what happens all too often is the people with the highest support needs miss out. This is the plan for those people, and yet, if you look at some of the initiatives, they’re still missing out.”</p> <p>Rishworth and the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, declined to comment on subminimum wages or the superannuation disparity.</p> <p>On launching the plan, Rishworth said making Australia a more disability-inclusive country was “a key priority for our government”.</p> <p>“It’s been clear for a long time that there is a need to evolve this sector and make sure people with disability have access to a range of high-quality employment options,” Rishworth said.</p> <p>“The plan will help everyone with high support needs to exercise genuine choice and control over their job and career. That means not just finding employment but meaningful and fulfilling roles that help them reach their career goals.”</p>",

Here’s what you need to know before semester one.</p> <h2>How important is the January release?</h2> <p>The UAC’s chief strategy and engagement officer, Kim Paino, said “for many students, this is the round they’ve been waiting for”, pointing to offers being made for the first time for a number of sought-after courses including medicine.</p> <p>It was also the first chance students had to change preferences after the first release of course offers.</p> <p>The most popular course for this round was a dual bachelor of medical science and doctor of medicine at the University of Newcastle, followed by a double commerce degree at UNSW and a bachelor of arts at the University of Sydney.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2020/08/table-tool/embed/app/main.html?spreadsheet=1qeYQW-8aKdGA8_uYNxtvYw8cBZqo2yc816ITElgOfs8\" data-alt=\"The top applied-for courses according to NSW’s UAC \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2020/08/table-tool/embed/app/main.html?spreadsheet=1qeYQW-8aKdGA8_uYNxtvYw8cBZqo2yc816ITElgOfs8\">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Source: University Admissions Centre</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lowest selection rank for entry into each course has also been updated before the next round of offers on 24 January.</p> <p>For those who haven’t applied, it’s not too late, with applications for first semester study open until midnight on Friday 2 February.</p> <p>“I’d encourage them to look at courses that still have vacancies for the next offer round and also think about all the other pathways available to get to university and study their preferred course,” Paino said.</p> <h2>How do university offers work?</h2> <p>University offers are issued to inboxes by state-based tertiary admission centres in a series of rounds, running from December to March.</p> <p>The first offers to graduating year 12 students were issued in December, covering the bulk of tertiary courses across the higher education, vocational education and training sectors.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Institutions decide which applicants receive an offer based upon a number of factors including the lowest selection rank (a student’s Atar, plus adjustment factors), interviews and special admission criteria.</p> <p>Most applicants receive their offers by the first January round, once end-of-year results are released for all students.</p> <p>If applicants didn’t receive their top pick in the first January round but did receive another offer, they are advised to accept it. Candidates will be automatically considered for their highest preferences in future offer rounds.</p> <p>Applicants have until Wednesday 17 January to finalise their preferences for the next round of UAC offers.</p> <h2>How many offers have been issued?</h2> <p>More than 100,000 year 12 graduates have now received offers across Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT.</p> <p>That’s not including early offers, or offers to be made in subsequent rounds. Tertiary admission centres say there are encouraging signs that despite cost-of-living pressures, school leavers are flocking to further studies in large numbers.</p> <p>The Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre issued 42,929 offers for graduating year 12 students in its December round – the largest release yet and 2,334 more offers than the same time in 2022.</p> <p>The UAC issued more than 35,000 Atar-based offers in December, while the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre provided offers to just shy of 11,000 year 12 graduates.</p> <p>Paino said across all application channels “we can see that year 12s are still applying for university”.</p> <p>“Demand from those not coming straight from year 12 has reduced this year, as that group is particularly sensitive to the rising costs of living and study and the strong employment market,” she said.</p> <h2>Which courses are popular?</h2> <p>Health and society and culture continue to dominate as the most popular courses across the nation for school leavers, accounting for just under half of first preferences to the UAC.</p> <p>Some 25.7% of applicants listed a health course as their first preference for 2024, while 20.6% listed a society and culture course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/13/hsc-results-2023-top-performers\">‘I realised I had it in me’: the NSW students who topped this year’s HSC courses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Five medical science courses were in the top 10 overall, with a combined bachelor of medical studies/doctor of medicine at UNSW maintaining its first position, with 1,481 first preferences.</p> <p>Second overall was a bachelor of business at UTS with 956 first preferences, followed by a bachelor of commerce at the University of Sydney with 742 first preferences.</p> <p>It was flipped in Victoria, where society and culture courses accounted for 19.75% of Vtac offers in the December round. Health followed at 17.62%, experiencing the largest increase compared with 2022 (16.9%).</p> <p>Offers to management and commerce courses were third (15.72%), while growth in Victorian teacher education courses was also strong, with 1,463 offers made in December – an increase of 8.05% from the same time last year and 4.1% of all offers.</p> <h2>What happens if you don’t get your first preference?</h2> <p>Don’t panic! The second round in December and first round in January are the biggest releases for undergraduate courses but there’s still time to change preferences to courses likely to have vacancies and with lower selection ranks.</p> <p>After UAC’s next January round there will two more rounds in February and a final round in March.</p> <p>Similarly, Vtac will issue its first round of January offers on Friday, with more to come throughout the month and in February, and Qtac has several rounds of offers throughout the year.</p> <p>The chief executive of Vtac, Teresa Tjia, advised graduates who hadn’t received an initial offer or had changed their mind to keep on top of change-of-preference deadlines.</p> <p>“There is still time to seek out support from your school, tertiary institutions, and [admission bodies] to maximise your opportunity to study,” she said.</p>",

And I do feel bad about this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/09/hyperverse-crypto-promoter-bitcoin-rodney-arrested-and-charged-in-us\">HyperVerse crypto promoter ‘Bitcoin Rodney’ arrested and charged in US </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I do feel deeply sorry for these people, I really do. You know, it’s horrible for them. I just hope that there is some resolution. I know it’s hard to get the money back off these people or whatever, but I just hope there can be some justice served in all of this where they can get to the bottom of this.”</p> <p>He said he wanted to make clear he had “certainly not pocketed” any of the money lost by investors.</p> <p>Harrison, who at the time was a freelance television presenter engaged in unpaid football commentary, said he had been approached and offered the HyperVerse work by a friend of a friend. He said he was new to the industry and had been open to picking up more work and experience as a corporate “presenter”.</p> <p>“I was told I was acting out a role to represent the business and many people do this,” Harrison said. He said he trusted his agent and accepted that. After reading through the scripts he said he was initially suspicious about the company he was hired to represent because he was unfamiliar with the crypto industry, but said he had been reassured by his agent that the company was legitimate.</p> <p>He said he had also done some of his own online research into the organisation and found articles about the Australian blockchain entrepreneur and HyperTech chairman Sam Lee.</p> <p>“I went away and I actually looked at the company because I was concerned that it could be a scam,” Harrison said. “So I looked online a bit and everything seemed OK, so I rolled with it.”</p> <p>Lee founded the Australian bitcoin company Blockchain Global with Ryan Xu, which collapsed in 2021 owing creditors $58m. Lee and Xu have been referred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for potential breaches of the Corporations Act in relation to Blockchain Global, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/04/asic-faces-questions-over-failure-to-warn-consumers-about-hyperverse-crypto-scheme\">Asic has said it does not intend to take action</a> at this time.</p> <p>Harrison said he had been told in his second recording that he needed to use a fake name.</p> <p>“I asked why, and they were like, ‘Well, you know, you’re an actor, you’re acting the role you’re presenting the business,’ and … my agent said, ‘Many people do this in the business. This is perfectly normal.’”</p> <p>In the videos, Harrison spoke generally about the opportunities offered for people who invested in the HyperVerse but did not explicitly ask for funds or make any claims about potential returns.</p> <p>He said he had only learned of the fake credentials that accompanied the launch presentation he featured in through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/04/chief-executive-of-collapsed-crypto-fund-hyperverse-does-not-appear-to-exist\">Guardian Australia’s investigation</a> that confirmed none of the organisations cited had any record of a Steven Reece Lewis.</p> <p>This included claims that he held degrees from Leeds and Cambridge universities and had worked for more than 10 years in the fintech industry.</p> <p>“I was absolutely shocked at what I saw,” Harrison said.</p> <p>“I never went online and checked about Steven Reece Lewis. I looked on YouTube occasionally, way back when they put the presentations up, but apart from that I was detached from this role. </p> <p>“When I read that in the papers, I was like, blooming heck, they make me sound so highly educated – I have GCSEs, I’m certainly not on that level. They painted a good picture of me but they never told me any of this.”</p> <p>He said all of the other claimed qualifications and work experience cited in the presentation were also false.</p> <p>After Guardian Australia’s report, a US-based YouTuber, Jack Gamble, revealed Harrison’s true identity. This prompted Harrison to come forward to share what he knew.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/14/crypto-currency-schemes-investors-losing-millions-regulation-hyperverse-warning-ntwnfb\">Investors lose millions as crypto schemes operate unchecked in Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Harrison’s contract for the role, an unsigned copy of which has been seen by Guardian Australia, he was employed as “Presenter Talent” by an Indonesian-based talent agency called Mass Focus Ltd.</p> <p>Guardian Australia can find no record of a company of this name on the Indonesian company register. Harrison said that aside from scripted online interactions he never spoke with anyone from HyperVerse, dealing solely with his local contact. He emphasised that he had no contact at any point with Lee or Xu.</p> <p>The terms of the contract were for a three-month renewable retainer, during which he would be paid 20,000 Thai baht a month for a maximum of six hours work a month. Harrison said most months he worked for only one to two hours, with three videos in one month the most work he undertook. He was sent a script before each recording. At one point, he said, there was a plan to fly him to the US for an event, but this had never happened.</p> <p>He was also provided with one wool and cashmere suit, two business shirts, two ties and a pair of shoes for the part.</p> <p>He said the filming had taken place in makeshift studios in Bangkok, including at an apartment in the Ekkamai district and later at the Empire tower in Sathon.</p> <p>Harrison said he had no oversight of the Twitter account run under the fake chief executive’s name, nor the messages of support for the scheme obtained from a clutch of celebrities, including the Apple founder Steve Wozniak and the actor Chuck Norris.</p> <p>He said that after his contract was twice renewed, running from September 2021 to June 2022, he requested that the Twitter account be shut down.</p> <p>The date of his final payslip coincided with the last date the Twitter account was active.</p>",

Just how far can they go once the action begins in Qatar? And at what point will they have met a reasonable level of expectations?</p> <p>The goal of all 24 competing nations is to win. But even with the progress they have made, narratives associated with the likes of Petar Šegrt’s Tajikis or Kim Pan-gon’s Malaysians not standing triumphant at the Lusail Stadium come 10 February will sharply contrast with those that will be spun if Jürgen Klinsmann’s South Korea or Hajime Moriyasu’s Japan aren’t doing so.</p> <p>And the Socceroos? The 2015 Asian Cup winners who were bundled out in the quarter-finals in 2019? In truth, it’s difficult to slap a projection on them; they can’t be said to exist at the same level of expectation as Japan or South Korea but they’re still capable of winning the tournament if everything breaks in the right manner for them. They are able to delight or disappoint in the same game, let alone across a tournament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/06/bahrain-australia-socceroos-international-football-friendly-report\">Duke helps stodgy Socceroos see off Bahrain in final Asian Cup warm-up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not helped by the Asian Cup’s postponement from June, after China’s withdrawal as host, the Socceroos coach, Graham Arnold, is in a somewhat awkward position. The delay has disrupted his plans to begin a period of squad rejuvenation for the 2026 World Cup cycle, leading to a situation where he has talked of heading to Doha as a Triclops: “One eye on the Asian Cup, but I’ve got two eyes on the World Cup.”</p> <p>Add to this injury problems (Mat Leckie, Denis Genreau), retirements (Aaron Mooy, Tom Rogić, Massimo Luongo), club wilderness (Ajdin Hrustić, Fran Karačić), and the complications of this tournament taking place during European club seasons (Alex Robertson, Alessandro Circati), and picking a 26-player squad has proven complicated.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there is significant talent on hand. Harry Souttar, Jordan Bos, Connor Metcalfe and Riley McGree are players who likely to be foundational contributors for the 2026 cycle. They’re being supplemented by a veteran core of figures including Jackson Irvine, Craig Goodwin and Mat Ryan who Arnold trusts to help him progress beyond the quarter-final stage of this tournament.</p> <p>And if we’re making historical callbacks, there exists a level of serendipity to this Asian Cup shifting to Qatar, given that it was Australia’s accomplishments in Doha just over 12 months ago that served to reset many narratives around the team and forced a re-examination of just what they could – and should – accomplish.</p>    <p>Nobody anticipated Australia achieving much of note at the 2022 World Cup, especially after cracks previously papered over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/a-hollywood-ending-to-world-cup-qualifying-appears-fanciful-for-depleted-socceroos\">emerged at the worst possible time</a> in qualifying. But then they damned the discourse and doubters by staging a historic run to a round of 16 clash in which they almost forced eventual champions, Argentina, into extra time. A string of encouraging results against the likes of England, Mexico and Argentina again have since followed in friendlies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/22/new-faces-and-old-warriors-in-socceroos-squad-for-asian-cup\">New faces and old warriors in Socceroos squad for Asian Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s enough to give you whiplash. The same team, by and large, whose systemic and tactical on-field foundations under Arnold’s tutelage remained mostly constant. Yet the outcomes were vastly different. Was it a natural upwards progression, representing a new baseline for the Asian Cup? Or was it a blend of circumstances, opposition and other factors creating an output that must at some point revert to the mean? Until the games begin, we can’t be certain.</p> <p>Of course, outcome-based as the analysis is, it’s not an unfair supposition that a team reaching the knockouts of a World Cup should then be capable of surpassing that feat in the subsequent continental equivalent. Such forecasts aren’t falling back into historical habits of disrespecting Asian opposition as much as it is recognising and respecting the Socceroos, as well as their significant accomplishment in reaching the World Cup round of 16.</p> <p>But games against Palestine and Bahrain, while both ending in wins, also gave indications that difficulties in breaking down embedded defences remain a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/06/bahrain-australia-socceroos-international-football-friendly-report\">point of concern</a>. In Asia teams are going to sit back, give the Socceroos the ball and try to hit them on the counter. That’s not the role Arnold’s side has enjoyed.</p> <p>Additionally, Saudi Arabia and Japan potentially await in a quarter-final and semi-final – opponents who handled the Socceroos with ease at the tail-end of their sputtering 2022 World Cup qualification campaign. In a way, these games serve as a control – a common pre- and post-World Cup opponent gauging the Socceroos’ progression.</p> <p>Ultimately, it’s maybe a milquetoast conclusion, from the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QJHUbtR0yI8?si=kyYg1i2-kG08l1t-\">“sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit”</a> school of analysis, but it feels accurate.

            "body" : "<p>Netflix’s seven-part adaptation of Trent Dalton’s acclaimed novel Boy Swallows Universe has a wonderful kind of tonal elasticity, stretching from despair to happiness in a heartbeat. Its directors Bharat Nalluri, Jocelyn Moorhouse and Kim Mordaunt expand a sprawling storyline with the kind of worldbuilding I associate more with video games and fantasy narratives, infusing scuzzy settings with a heightened, almost magical realism, a transcendental energy niggling at the show’s edges.</p> <p>Like the book, Boy Swallows Universe is set in lower-class Brisbane circa 1985, a city filled with lowlifes and troublemakers who orbit the life of 13-year-old protagonist Eli (Felix Cameron and then Zac Burgess). They include his mentor, Slim (Bryan Brown), his dad, Robert (Simon Baker), his mother, Frances (Phoebe Tonkin) and her boyfriend, Lyle (Travis Fimmel) – yet another father figure. There’s also Eli’s mute older brother, Gus (Lee Tiger Halley), who communicates by writing words in the air with his finger, displayed for the audience in white powdery letters like skywriting from a tiny plane.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raizBMsLYug\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/raizBMsLYug?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Boy Swallows Universe</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The series kicks off with goons dragging Lyle away and throwing him in the boot of a car: an intense opener incongruously followed by Eli’s wholesome narration: “Our mum really is the best in the world” – which reflects the tone of the whole show: ugly adult realities fused with a youthful outlook.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it’s good, this series can be very, very good: a one-of-a-kind Australian period piece</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The storyline is more a scattered array of vignettes than a plot per se, covering – among other things – Eli assisting Lyle with drug dealing, engaging with various underworld figures, dealing with bullies at school and exchanging letters with an imprisoned pen pal (Adam Briggs). There are recurring visions of Eli and Gus in a car flying through space, which begin as dream sequences but are interestingly recontextualised, moved into the realm of memories or quasi-flashbacks.</p> <p>The tone of the show is a little lighter than in the novel, which feels more down and dirty. Dalton’s book left me in two minds: while I respect the form and craft of his prose, I found it rather haphazardly plotted and lacking momentum. The TV series is also structurally chaotic – but there’s usually a sense the directors have their feet on the gas.</p> <p>Boy Swallows Universe’s biggest problem is the disappointing final episode, which spectacularly struggles to translate the book’s admittedly wild ending. There’ll be no spoilers here; suffice to say that a dramatic denouement – and the events leading up to it – throw the series’ entire equilibrium out of whack. Things get very Scooby Doo-ish very quickly, to the point where I half expected a moustache-twirling character to snarl, “And I would’ve gotten away with it if it wasn’t for you meddling kids!”</p>    <p>Yet so much of this series impresses. The directors capture crime and scumbaggery in a way we don’t see very often – with a bright and juicy colour palette and an air of heart and humour. The show never looks down on characters, nor does it turn a blind eye to their terrible behaviour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/02/extraordinary-and-beautiful-storytelling-boy-swallows-universe-wins-abia-book-of-the-year\">‘Extraordinary and beautiful storytelling’: Boy Swallows Universe wins ABIA book of the year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cast is strong. Fimmel is dynamite as Lyle, a man who stomps around with a crazed step in his gait, trying hard and failing spectacularly. Tonkin persuasively embodies Frances, imbuing her with a complex combination of tender and torture. And Baker, his eyes still heavy and red from all that heroin in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/limbo-review-simon-baker-is-transcendent-in-another-beautiful-film-from-ivan-sen\">Limbo</a>, packs a punch as Eli and Gus’s dad – another character bluffing through life with a bad hand, fighting off the feeling that it’s too late to start again.</p> <p> Cameron and Burgess are fine as Eli, but I found something a little ill-fitting about their presence, perhaps a tad clean-cut for this hard-knuckled world. I get that their wholesomeness is partly the point – Eli’s youthful zest serves as a contrast to the adults – but for me, still, they didn’t quite sit right. I wonder if the youngsters could have been directed towards delivering more unsettled performances, still capturing that ring of innocence and optimism but in a rawer and heavier way, perhaps like Jean-Pierre Léaud in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/the-400-blows-review-francois-truffaut\">The 400 Blows</a> or Quvenzhané Wallis in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/18/beast-southern-wild-review\">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a>, high though that benchmark may be.</p> <p>Boy Swallows Universe sometimes reminded me of the latter in its treatment of light and dark, its portrayal of people in the gutter reaching for the stars. It’s not as tonally controlled as Benh Zeitlin’s great film, that’s for sure – particularly when it reaches that ending, which was so jarring I rewatched the last two episodes just to try to make peace with it. But when it’s good, this series can be very, <em>very </em>good: a one-of-a-kind Australian period piece.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Boy Swallows Universe in on Netflix from Thursday</em></p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>Egypt’s period of success during the late 2000s at the Africa Cup of Nations can be defined by forward-thinking attackers who seemed to have only one instruction on their mind when taking the pitch: go for goal. In 2006, the duo of Ahmed Hassan and Emad Moteab scored eight of Egypt’s 12 goals. Two years later the triumvirate of Hosny Abd Rabo, Mohamed Aboutrika and Amr Zaki scored four each. In 2010, it was Hassan again, alongside the super-sub Gedo, who averaged a goal every 35 minutes.</p> <p>The national team now boasts their best-ever goalscorer in Mohamed Salah. But the mentality has changed somewhat and he has scored only six goals in three Afcon editions, two in each. Combining that with the fact that he is relied on as Egypt’s primary creator makes one thing abundantly clear: he needs help.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/07/morocco-are-favourites-to-win-afcon-can-they-repeat-world-cup-heroics\">Morocco are favourites to win Afcon – can they repeat World Cup heroics? | Yara El-Shaboury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the golden generation of the late 2000s, Egypt have been to two Afcon finals, losing in 2017 against Cameroon before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/senegal-egypt-africa-cup-of-nations-final-match-report\" title=\"\">falling short against Senegal</a> in 2022. During both those runs, Egypt’s negative football got them to the ultimate match. But it also caused them to crash in their final act.</p> <p>That is not to say that defensive football is bad. Sometimes, it is necessary. The stark reality of tournament football is that tactical astuteness often is needed to progress. Not a single Egyptian would have batted an eye towards the style of play if Salah and co had gone on to lift either of those Afcon trophies. But the final losses show the obvious: there needs to be a balance. Defensive stability can only get you so far. You need to have decisive finishers (note the plurality of the word) who you can count on when it matters. If Egypt head to Afcon again relying solely on Salah to carry the goalscoring burden and creativity, then the ending of their story is going to be a familiar one.</p> <p>Egypt’s current starting forward line consists of Salah and Mahmoud Hassan, better known as Trézéguet, on the wings and Nantes’ Mostafa Mohamed in the centre-forward role. All three are in good form for their club sides, but it is another player who could emerge as a formidable goal threat and a potential relief for Salah: Omar Marmoush.</p>    <p>The 24-year-old has thrived since moving to Eintracht Frankfurt last summer, taking the place of the seemingly irreplaceable Randal Kolo Muani. Marmoush is now Eintracht’s top scorer, having already bettered his best full‑season attacking statistics with seven goals and three assists in 14 league games.</p> <p>His most memorable performance of the season so far came against Bayern Munich in Frankfurt’s 5-1 victory with a goal and two assists, but his output is more impressive when considering the variety of goals he offers. Whether outmuscling defenders, scoring with long-range strikes or dribbling through an array of bodies before finding the net, Marmoush is a player transformed.</p> <p>He is a winger by trade but under Dino Toppmöller he has adapted to playing further up the pitch. His new-found versatility in playing as a lone striker or part of a front two has helped to refine his eye for hitting the back of the net. “Omar is a very good player who has now discovered scoring goals a bit,” Toppmöller said after Frankfurt’s 3-0 defeat of Union Berlin, where Marmoush scored the first two goals. “We’re working with him there. The goals that are coming for him at the moment are only a reward for the hard work he puts in for us.</p> <p>“Because of his speed, he always has moments that are uncomfortable for a defender when he makes that deep run. But he now also has a feeling for getting into dangerous areas again and again, and helping us with his footballing technique.”</p>    <p>His improvement this season has not gone unnoticed by the Egypt manager, Rui Vitória, who recently mentioned Marmoush alongside Mohamed as his side’s goal-scoring threat, begging the question of whether we might see him in a new role.</p> <p>Mohamed is more of a traditional No 9 who will give Egypt an aerial threat and work tirelessly to get the better of the centre-backs he comes up against. Nonetheless, he can find himself isolated. Marmoush, who averages per 90 minutes more shots on target, chances created and progressive carries than Mohamed and Trézéguet, can drop in deep, dribble out of tight spaces, and create chances for those around him, such as Salah.</p> <p>Egypt finally have inform options up front, which has not been the case for more than a decade. The hope is that Vitória recognises when the unique strengths of his forward players are needed and acts accordingly.</p> <p>Since the 2010 triumph, Egypt have been in a strange position. They are often tipped as one of the Afcon favourites because of their aura and Salah, but they have not been very good. Teams defend incredibly deep against the Pharaohs, but because they themselves have not had the quality going forward they also play defensive football.</p> <p>The result is, at best, 90 minutes of deep soul boredom that, for Egypt fans, has not been worth it when another team inevitably goes on to lift the trophy. In Ivory Coast, we can still expect the same scrappy Egypt of the past decade, but maybe this time, when the ball ventures into the final third, there will be a bit more of the fluid football that fans came to expect from the golden generation.</p> <p>Salah has long been the Pharaohs’ shining star and will likely remain that way for some time. Constantly in the spotlight since his debut, he has been tasked with carrying a mediocre side. But it has not been enough. Because for every big name, there needs to be a fitting supporting act. Marmoush can be exactly that if given the chance.</p>",

He was raised by an Australian-Irish mother and a father whose Maltese roots went “so far back” that he didn’t know the family’s origin story.</p> <p>So by the time Bajada was researching his cookbook on Malta’s cuisine, he had a lot to discover about family and food.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/04/best-vietnamese-recipes-rice-paper-rolls-grilled-fish-jerry-mai\">‘It’s really well-balanced, there’s a bit of everything’: how to cook and eat like you’re on holiday in Vietnam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We would have these big lunches in Perth where Dad’s side [lived], and there’d be arguments about where things are from because of our connections to southern Europe, and this big community of Maltese-Egyptians we were a part of, because my grandfather was born in Alexandria,” he says.</p>    <p>But when he travelled to Malta, a lot of the culinary puzzle pieces fell into place. “[I] saw the love for Kunserva [a brand of tomato paste] and it all made sense at last,” he says. “My grandma used it like you wouldn’t believe, and we used to lick it on a spoon from the jar.”</p> <p>He also found mint and spices – ingredients he often associated with Middle Eastern and north African cooking – in the local cuisine. But the biggest surprise, he says, was that even in summer on the archipelago, Maltese food tends to be on the heavier side.</p> <p>“It’s surrounded by the sea, so you’d think seafood would be more prominent but it’s not,” he says. “It’s so accessible [that] it’s not considered special. What is considered special is hearty warmer dishes, which is weird because it’s a warm climate.”</p> <h2><strong>A typical Maltese spread</strong></h2> <p>Bajada says stews and big pots of soup “that get tapped into as the week goes on” are the mainstays of Maltese eating. During his travels he noticed one dish might spin off into a few forms: meat might be served as a main but its sauce would be cooked with marrows (large zucchinis) for a starter.</p> <p>Though the table is often piled with smaller dishes: arjoli, tuna tomato dip; bigilla, a dip made of tic beans (similar to broad beans) and garlic; galletti, water crackers; ġbejniet, a sheep or goat’s milk cheese that might be served fresh, slightly dry and chalky, or preserved in vinegar and showered with cracked pepper; and perhaps a salad of white beans (fażola bajda bit-tewm u t-tursin) or cold octopus (qarnit bit-tewm).</p>    <p>His recipe below features tender octopus, plus fresh basil and parsley, red onion, tomatoes and garlic. A couple of tablespoons of white wine vinegar helps tie it together – though he says you could use lemon juice. “It’s essentially a fresh, vibrant zingy salad,” he says.</p> <p>These smaller dishes, he says, are interchangeable, and are often served before a heavier dish such as bragioli (beef steaks stuffed and rolled with mince, speck and breadcrumbs, then braised in a red-wine sauce) or stuffat tal-fenek (rabbit stew).</p> <h2>The essential ingredients</h2> <p>Bajada says tomatoes – either fresh or in paste form – and olive oils are essentials, and broad beans, olives and capers are “everywhere”.</p> <p>“In summer you could pull over to the side of the road and see farmers and old grandmas walking around picking capers,” he says.</p> <p>Maltese cooking, he says, is vegetable-heavy. “To this day a lot of veg is still grown locally … Being an island, they don’t import much, and wherever you go there’s a plot where someone is growing something, or roadside stalls selling local vegetables.”</p>    <p>“Broad beans are so loved. They make a soup with broad beans and a small pasta shape not that different from fregola – a small pellet shape called kusksu.” (In his book, Bajada suggests substituting with fregola, ditalini pasta or pearl couscous.) The soup – also called kusksu – is served with a ball of ġbejna in the bowl.</p> <h2>Qarnit bit-tewm (Octopus salad) – recipe</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddf0dfcdf9e39c74c1c788e367d20d1cf4983a4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddf0dfcdf9e39c74c1c788e367d20d1cf4983a4e/0_0_4873_6822/714.jpg\" alt=\"Topview of a plate of octopus and tomato salad\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qarnit bit-tewm (octopus salad).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Bajada</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This cold salad is perfect for a hot day in the sun or as an appetiser.

A Nazi-appointed appraiser offered $360, paid into a blocked account that the family was unable to access.</p> <p>Cassirer spent years searching for the oil on canvas work, according to her heirs. She accepted reparations from the German government in 1958 but did not waive her right to seek the painting’s return.</p> <p>The painting had changed hands repeatedly before being bought by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. In 1993 it was passed to Spain when a state-backed non-profit foundation paid the baron $338m for much of his collection, to be installed at a museum bearing his name.</p> <p>In 2000, Cassirer’s grandson Claude discovered that the painting was on display at Madrid’s Thyssen-Bornemisza museum. After Spain rebuffed the family’s request for its return, the long-running legal battle was launched. The painting’s value has been estimated at $30m.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the federal appeals court said that Spanish law – which defines ownership as six years of uninterrupted possession – should take precedence when considering the question of ownership.</p> <p>Lawyers for the Cassirer family said in a joint statement that they would seek a review by an 11-judge ninth circuit panel. “The Cassirers believe that, especially in light of the explosion of antisemitism in this country and around the world today, they must challenge Spain’s continuing insistence on harbouring Nazi-looted art.”</p> <p>In Spain, the court’s decision was welcomed by the museum’s managing director. “It is good news,” said Evelio Acevedo, adding: “The good faith acquisition of this work by this institution is something that has been demonstrated from the first moment.”</p>",

Those hoaxes came after letters containing fentanyl were sent to elections office in a handful of states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/10/election-offices-letters-fentanyl-usps\">in November</a>.</p> <p>A recent wave of threats against elections officials and judges foretells a tense presidential election year that’s likely to see ongoing threats of political violence that could turn physical, as the future of US democracy hangs in the balance.</p> <p>“It does seem sort of like it’s a message starting off the year, saying, ‘OK we are in 2024, and this is not going to be easy. Elections are not going to go smoothly, and you better be scared,’” said Lilliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies political violence.</p> <p>The wave comes after several years of sustained threats to and harassment of elections officials, who have seen high turnover in their field as a result. It’s now part of the job to face an onslaught of harassing messages when running an election in the US.</p> <p>While these recent threats haven’t carried physical violence, they aren’t innocent. They disrupt and intimidate the people involved – and they cause chaos, making it difficult for elections officials to do their jobs. Women and people of color are more often the targets of these threats, Mason said, which could drive people out of the jobs, potentially changing the profile of who runs elections.</p> <p>A threat against a building, such as the bomb threats, takes hours to investigate and evacuate to ensure people are safe. Threats like doxing, or posting personal information online, or swatting someone’s home take even longer to unwind, requiring more security, staying in another location and scrubbing online information. It’s not always clear, either, whether a threat is simply designed to sow chaos or will lead to violence.</p> <p>“Today, it could be warnings. Tomorrow, there could be an actual bomb that goes off or there could be an assassination attempt with a rifle,” said Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who directs the Chicago Project on Security and Threats.</p> <p>Beyond the effects on those targeted, violence and intimidation are destabilizing and distract people from thinking more soberly about the country and its future, Mason said.</p> <p>“They focus our energy on who is mad at who and dividing us against each other, rather than focusing on the wellbeing of the nation as a whole,” she said.</p> <p>Shenna Bellows, the Democratic secretary of state in Maine, had her home swatted – with state troopers searching her house summoned by a call about a fake break-in – after her decision on the 14th amendment question that would result in Trump being left off the ballot in the state. Her personal cellphone number and home address were posted online. She knew that her decision would bring strong reactions, but not to this extent.</p> <p>“The ensuing threatening communications, the doxing, the swatting of my home are unacceptable,” she said. “We should be able to agree to disagree on issues that are extraordinarily important and even controversial with respect and civility. We should be able to disagree without threats of violence.”</p> <p>Pape, who has conducted surveys showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey\">increasing support for political violence</a> in the US, said the recent wave of threats shows exactly what he was concerned about.</p> <p>They show that the country is a “tinderbox”, where people increasingly support violence to achieve their political goals as they lose faith in democracy, he said. Pape also pointed out the threats have come in waves since the January 6 insurrection and could increase this year, especially if Trump’s supporters believe he will not win at the ballot box. The increased support for violence gives the people doing threats a “mantle of legitimacy”.</p> <p>“These volatile individuals are often encouraged to take the next step toward actual violence by a perception they’re doing it in a community’s interest,” he said.</p> <p>Trump and his allies have not sought to tamp down their rhetoric or condemn the threats made by supporters, but such a condemnation could make a difference, Mason and Pape both said.</p> <p>Strong bipartisan statements against political violence and threats have a tangible effect, Pape said. Given the reaction politicians often get when standing against their party, particularly Trump, some Republicans have privately said they fear for their safety and their families and have shied away from speaking out against him.</p> <p>“One thing that we found to be pretty effective at reducing regular people’s approval of political violence is just to have their leaders tell them that it’s not OK. It’s pretty simple. And the problem is that Trump is not doing that,” Mason said. “The tragedy is that we have very easy ways to reduce violent tendencies in the electorate, but those ways tend to be based on leadership playing a responsible role.”</p> <p>The incredibly high stakes of the 2024 election, where both sides see an existential battle for the country’s future, are not typical of a normal election.</p> <p>“It’s not supposed to feel that way. If it’s existential, then the bedrock of democracy – which is loser’s consent – is harder to agree to,” Mason said.</p> <p>Bellows, the Maine secretary of state, said she also received messages of support alongside the threats and harassment. One former GOP legislator reached out and asked if she needed a place to stay or firearms, she said.

            "body" : "<p>After a storied career spanning four decades in which she has played Tina Turner, Coretta Scott King, Rosa Parks and Black Panther’s Queen Ramonda, Angela Bassett received her first Academy Award on Tuesday – an honorary Oscar.</p> <p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honoured the actor at its 14th annual Governors awards, an event recognising lifetime achievement in film as well as in humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>The 65-year-old actor was previously nominated for Oscars for her performance as Tina Turner in the biopic What’s Love Got to Do With It? and for her role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/nov/08/black-panther-wakanda-forever-review-chadwick-boseman-letitia-wright-marvel\">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a> – the first actor in a Marvel film and the first woman from a superhero movie to receive such a nod.</p> <p>Mel Brooks, 97, and Carol Littleton, the film editor behind ET and Body Heat, were also recognised with honorary Oscars at the ceremony, which was originally scheduled for November but delayed due to the writers’ and actors’ strikes. The award honours “extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences, or for outstanding service to the Academy”.</p> <p>The Sundance Institute’s Michelle Satter received the Jean Hersholt humanitarian award.</p> <p>The Governors awards serve as an opportunity for the Academy to correct past oversights and honour the careers of beloved Hollywood icons while bringing together some of the biggest names in the industry. Tuesday’s ceremony was hosted by comedian John Mulaney and widely attended by A-listers and Oscar hopefuls, including Margot Robbie, Bradley Cooper, America Ferrera, Cillian Murphy, Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore, among others.</p> <p>The mood was relaxed and celebratory inside of the Dolby theatre with the winners of the evening’s awards announced far in advance.</p>    <p>Regina King, Bassett’s co-star in the 1991 film Boyz n the Hood, introduced the actor, describing her as an incomparable “national treasure”.</p> <p>“She has a perspective and a voice and a beauty that is proudly Black but what she embodies at her core is beyond anything that is skin deep,” King said. “She is artistic excellence embodied in human form.”</p> <p>Bassett appeared on stage to a lengthy applause, offering her thanks to her family, including her husband, the actor Courtney B Vance.</p> <p>“I have considered acting my calling and not just my career. I do this work because I find it meaningful. And I hope in some way that it makes a difference and has an impact,” she said. “To be recognised in this way for what I’m doing is truly wonderful. And I am beyond grateful.”</p> <p>Bassett is just the second Black female actor to receive an honorary Oscar (after Cicely Tyson), she said during her speech, in which she recognised trailblazers who came before her such as Hattie McDaniel. McDaniel, the first Black person to win an Oscar, tore down barriers to allow Black women to receive recognition at the highest levels in the industry, Bassett said.</p> <p>“To my fellow Black actresses, fill your hearts with courage and strength because regardless of what you may think or see or feel your contributions do matter,” she said. “Remember who you are and who our ancestors intended you to be.”</p> <p>“I proudly share this moment with women who stand up when they are told to stand back, who speak up when they are silenced, who remain determined when they are told they are defeated. These women represent those that I’ve had the honour to portray, as well as the everyday women who surround us and inspire us to keep striving.”</p> <p>Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, who starred in the 2005 version of Brooks’ The Producers, presented the honorary Oscar to the comedian, actor and film-maker with a song based on some of his biggest hits.</p> <p>“This is beautiful. I gotta tell you this means a lot to me. It really means a lot. I feel so bad about the Oscar I got for best original screenplay for The Producers. I never should have sold it,” he said to laughs.</p> <p>“When your peers appreciate your work and they salute you with this golden statue it means a great deal. It really does.”</p> <p>Directors Ryan Coogler and Chloé Zhao presented the humanitarian award to Michelle Satter, whose work has “changed the world,” Coogler said. Past recipients of the award include Frank Sinatra, Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey.</p> <p>Satter, the founding director of the Sundance Institute, has worked with countless independent film-makers, including Coogler and Zhao, through the institute’s labs.</p> <p>Glenn Close introduced Littleton, highlighting the role of film editors in crafting cinema. Littleton dedicated her award to all the editors “who toil in the darkness of an editing room, weighing each cut, making infinite choices to create a unique believable world born of imagination.” Littleton reminisced on her experiences editing ET, which she described as “a powerful story about tolerance for the other”.</p> <p>“With a little humility and patience we too can find our common humanity in uncommon places,” she said.</p>",

If the rules are, as many advocates believe, an effort to dissuade Republicans from overriding DeWine’s veto, that effort appears unsuccessful. House Republicans are expected to successfully vote to revive the bill during a highly anticipated special legislative session on Wednesday.</p> <p>Though HB 68 focused on minors, the governor’s new proposal would require all patients seeking gender-affirming care – including adults – to obtain the “care and supervision” of a team of medical providers, including an endocrinologist, bioethicist and a psychiatrist. All trans patients would also be required to undergo “lengthy” mental health counseling.</p> <p>“We’ve seen this playbook before, with abortion,” said Strangio. “You start by focusing the legal restriction on minors’ access to care, then expand those laws to adults later on.”</p> <p>Under the new rules, medical providers would also be required to report data about trans patients every six months, tracking the number of patients who are diagnosed and treated for gender dysphoria. The rules would be enacted and enforced by the Ohio health agencies after a public comment period.</p> <p>“If you’re old enough to register for the draft, to enter a contract, to vote, then you’re old enough to make your own healthcare decisions without the government involving itself,” said Nick Zingarelli, whose 14-year-old daughter is transgender.</p> <p>The Zingarelli family moved to Ohio by way of St Louis in 2022, after the Missouri legislature ramped up efforts to restrict trans minors’ access to gender-affirming care. Born and raised in Cincinnati, Zingarelli thought his home state of Ohio would offer his teenage daughter “a less politicized existence”.</p> <p>“But we came back to Ohio and unfortunately had to continue to fight a lot of the same legislative battles here,” Zingarelli said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/18/trans-americans-upstate-new-york-rochester\">Trans people are finding safe haven in an unexpected place: upstate New York</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the governor blocked HB 68 late last month, Zingarelli breathed a sigh of relief. He and his wife were among the dozens of parents of transgender children who fought against the Ohio bill since its introduction nearly one year ago.</p> <p>Zingarelli and the broader coalition of parents turned advocates anticipated some resistance from the legislature: Republicans hold a supermajority in both the Ohio house and senate, meaning lawmakers could override the governor’s veto. The parents were disappointed, yet unsurprised, when the Republican speaker, Jason Stephens, announced that the Ohio house would reconvene weeks earlier than scheduled in an attempt to revive HB 68.</p> <p>The parents did not anticipate, however, that the governor might use executive authority to affect the lives of trans adults.</p> <p>LGBTQ+ advocates compared DeWine’s proposed rules to the targeted regulation of abortion providers, or Trap laws – legal measures that regulate where abortions may be provided and performed. Major medical organizations oppose Trap laws and have called them clandestine attempts to limit abortion access through costly and medically unnecessary requirements.</p> <p>“It’s a similar strategy here,” said Golski. “They’re telling us, don’t worry, care is still legal, but here are all the new hoops you have to jump through to make sure you’re complying with this vague and confusing rule.”</p> <p>Golski and other LGBTQ+ advocates in Ohio spent the weekend scrambling to decode the proposed rules from DeWine.</p> <p>“Does every single clinic need its own bioethicist, or do you need to assign one to every single patient? What qualifies as the legal definition of a bioethicist?” she said. “Not to mention, there’s already such a shortage of psychiatrists that are trained in caring for trans patients.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/zooey-zephyr-trans-politician-montana-interview\">She was censored over trans rights. But lawmaker Zooey Zephyr won’t be silenced</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ohio, like most states, has suffered from a growing shortage of mental health workers in recent years. According to the US Department of Labor and Statistics, Ohio has approximately <a href=\"https://www.neomed.edu/news/support-for-cmha-bill/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Department,profession%20in%20the%20near%20future.\">one psychiatrist per every 10,000 people in the state.</a></p> <p>Adult trans patients at a Columbus-based clinic told the Guardian this week they were warned by providers that the clinic would likely have to shut down if the governor’s rules took effect.</p> <p>Still, transgender Ohio residents hope that the senate, typically more moderate than the house, will lose its zeal for a veto override. Advocates are also working to alter the language of DeWine’s administrative rules during the public comment period, when Ohio health officials will take into account the public’s concerns about the proposed rules.</p> <p>“We’re really hoping that the state takes the public’s feedback into account,” Golski said. “What the legislature is trying to do with the veto override would be harder to reverse, but the administrative rules could be just as – if not more – devastating for trans people in this state.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In December, Vladimir Putin finally ended any suspense by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/08/vladimir-putin-to-run-for-russian-president-again-in-march-2024\">announcing his candidacy</a> for a fifth term as Russia’s president. With a blend of resignation and cynicism, the world will watch as the country gears up for another presidential “election” – a term I employ with the heaviest of quotation marks.</p> <p>In the lead-up to the election, Russia will undergo a cosmetic transformation. Streets will be cleaned, buildings given a fresh coat of paint and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russians-set-to-approve-radical-overhaul-that-could-keep-putin-in-power-until-2036-11593593621\">pensioners handed their electoral encouragement</a>: a free meal. On the day of the election, students and state employees will be herded to polling stations to perform their most important job: voting in an orchestrated display of fealty to Putin.</p> <p>Putin will feign humility at his landslide victory, in what will probably be touted as a historic turnout. And yet, rigged as it will be, the election is profoundly important, as Putin knows very well – consider why he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/25/alexei-navalny-discovered-in-remote-arctic-penal-colony\">exiled his biggest political opponent</a>, Alexei Navalny, to a remote Arctic colony.</p> <p>Authoritarian elections are more than mere theatrics: they are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.060106.095434\">a critical tool</a> for dictators to maintain power. If conducted effectively, sham elections solidify a ruler’s authority. However, if executed poorly, they can jeopardise an entire regime.</p> <p>Beneath the veneer of absolute power lies a truth known to every tyrant: no ruler governs alone. Every leader only holds power as long as they <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262524407/\">maintain the support of their winning coalition</a> – key decision-makers who have the power to retain or oust them. In democracies, this coalition consists of the majority of voters, but for Putin, it is his inner circle – those friends and confidants who helped him rise to power and whom he repaid with top positions in government and industry.</p> <p>Elections are a time of reckoning for all regimes. In autocratic regimes, the reckoning is informal and takes place behind closed doors. In the lead-up to the election, the autocrat and their inner circle review the deal they struck. The leader must demonstrate strength, as evidence of their continued ability to guarantee the safety and prosperity of the inner circle. In return, the inner circle proves its continued loyalty. Political appointees deliver the votes; economic oligarchs pitch in to pay for the campaign; the security apparatus stands by to foil dissent.</p> <p>The public – the “voters” expected to rubber-stamp the leader’s continued rule – might seem negligible but are in fact a weathervane of the regime’s stability. They reflect whether the regime’s blend of repression and propaganda is effective or in need of recalibration.</p> <p>This highly orchestrated process leaves little room for surprises, making elections a period of vulnerability for the leader and their supporters. In the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/05/russia-election-violence-arrests-moscow\">Russia’s heavily rigged 2011 parliamentary election</a>, protesters took to the streets in Moscow and St Petersburg, leading to the rise of Navalny and his formidable political apparatus. Though those protests were eventually suppressed, this isn’t always the case. In January 2005, five years before he finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/08/viktor-yanukovych-ukraine-president-election\">became Ukraine’s president</a>, Putin’s ally Viktor Yanukovych was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/01/ukraine.nickpatonwalsh\">resign from his post as prime minister</a> after public protests erupted when he claimed victory in a rigged presidential vote.</p> <p>Having learned from these experiences, Putin has constructed an extensive apparatus of repression that obviates any chance of mass protests in Russia. An autocrat-in-chief for a quarter-century, Putin also knows how to leverage elections to <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/structuring-conflict-in-the-arab-world/A503BF2699E19AF1B8C8C283ADFF7E0F\">threaten, divide and co-opt the opposition</a> by allowing some candidates to appear on the ballot and banning others. Then, while those in the first category decide whether <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414008325571\">to partake in the charade</a> and share the spoils, the forbidden opponents bicker over whether to boycott the election or converge behind a single “allowed” opposition candidate.</p> <p>With Russia’s economy seemingly rebounding from the initial shocks of western sanctions, Putin’s case is quite strong. Skewing ideologically conservative and nostalgic for the Soviet Union in its prime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/sanctions-vladimir-putin-kremlin-russian-oligarchy\">none of Putin’s elites</a> have personally lost any sleep over the war in Ukraine. Nevertheless, Putin is not entirely secure. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/05/hand-grenade-explosion-caused-plane-crash-that-killed-wagner-boss-says-putin\">mysterious demise of Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> illustrates the lengths to which Putin will go to avoid embarrassment and maintain order before his election.</p> <p>Unexpected developments that may expose Putin’s weakness to his inner circle right before the re-evaluation of their mutual quid pro quo are a significant concern. Embarrassments such as a significant battlefield loss in Ukraine, a surge in inflation or even a corruption scandal could weaken Putin’s standing with his elites when he needs them most.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/06/from-gaza-to-ukraine-brute-force-threatens-to-triumph-in-2024\">From Gaza to Ukraine, brute force threatens to triumph in 2024</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This presents a strategic opportunity for those aiming to weaken Putin’s grip on power. Ukraine has an instinct for striking symbolic targets at pivotal moments – from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/sinking-moskva-what-we-know-russia-ship-sunk-missile-ukraine#:~:text=It%20attributes%20the%20loss%20to,this%20caused%20it%20to%20sink.\">sinking of the Moskva battleship</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/why-is-the-kerch-bridge-attack-significant-to-the-war-in-ukraine\">bombing the Kerch Bridge</a> that connects Crimea to Russia during peak vacation season. Perhaps it is plotting a pre-election surprise for Putin. If Ukraine’s western partners are ever to get serious about expropriating Russia’s frozen assets, now is the time.</p> <p>To be clear, there is no scenario in which Putin loses this election. The next few months, however, will determine what he does upon the conclusion of the electoral farce. If all goes well for him he will emerge as strong as ever, ready for a new round of domestic repression, mobilisation and escalation in Ukraine. If things go less smoothly, Putin may find himself too busy rebuilding his inner circle to pursue more nefarious goals.</p> <ul> <li><p>Olga Chyzh researches political violence and repressive regimes.

As the subsequent screams and gunshots made clear, their aim was to deliver a message that could not be ignored.</p> \n<p>“We are on air so that you know you don’t mess with the mafia,” said one of the men, who were armed with pistols, shotguns, sticks of dynamite and other explosives.</p> \n<p>Fifteen minutes of live footage showed staff being herded into the studio and forced to lie on the ground as criminal gangs across the country launched a series of seemingly coordinated attacks. It came a day after the president, Daniel Noboa, declared a state of emergency to tackle spiralling criminal violence in the small South American nation.</p> \n<p>“They shot one cameraman in the leg and broke another’s arm,” Rendón later told his own TV channel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/ecuador-map/giv-13425OjnTGmMaUtSm/\" data-alt=\"Map of Ecuador showing Guayaquil\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/ecuador-map/giv-13425OjnTGmMaUtSm/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The attackers then threatened the captives with guns and explosives and placed a stick of dynamite in the breast pocket of one of Rendón’s colleagues, the journalist José Luis Calderón.</p> \n<p>“They put a gun to my head,” Alina Manrique, the head of news for TC Televisión, told the Associated Press. “I was really suffering and panicking. I thought about my whole life and about my two children.”</p> \n<p>As the workers pleaded for their lives and horrified viewers followed the siege from their homes, specialist police units were beginning to arrive at the scene to seal off the building and prepare their entry.</p> \n<p>“The criminals – there were six of them on the scene – said [the police] needed to go or they’d kill us,” said Manrique. “I was just crying with panic.”</p> \n<p>Within minutes, however, the signal had been cut and heavily armed tactical officers had entered the studio, their presence far outnumbering that of the attackers.</p> \n<p>“Eventually, the criminals realised they were outnumbered and surrendered their weapons,” said Manrique. “I hugged a policeman, who gave me his hand and I got up off the floor.”</p> \n<p>No one was killed in the attack. César Zapata, the commander of Ecuador’s Policía Nacional, said later that 13 people had been arrested and weapons, explosives and other pieces of evidence seized.</p> \n<p>“The hostages were freed and the workers attended to,” he said. “The suspects will be brought before justice to face trial for terrorist acts.”</p> \n<p>His comments, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CmdtPoliciaEc/status/1744853625841602707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1744853625841602707%7Ctwgr%5E999c249a4b3a5e464def6c5bfd63f7f7c329dccd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.primicias.ec%2Fnoticias%2Fseguridad%2Fataque-armado-tc-television%2F\">posted in a tweet on X</a>, were accompanied by a video stamped with the word CAPTURADOS (captured) that showed the blurred faces of the attackers, the weapons confiscated and the bound suspects being led from the scene.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CmdtPoliciaEc/status/1744853625841602707\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">El operativo policial en <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tctelevision?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tctelevision</a> dejó 13 aprehendidos, armas, explosivos y otros indicios. <br><br>Se liberaron a los rehenes y se puso a buen recaudo a los trabajadores. <br><br>Los causantes serán puestos ante la justicia para que sean sancionados por los actos terroristas. <a href=\"https://t.co/9KEXWvDfzZ\">pic.twitter.com/9KEXWvDfzZ</a></p>— GraD.

Because believe me, we need peace as Ecuadorians. We need peace to get beyond all this.”</p> \n<p>An equally composed Calderón, still wearing the jacket in whose pocket a stick of dynamite had earlier been deposited, issued a similar plea.</p> \n<p>“This was a totally unprecedented act – and one that leads to a reflection,” he said.</p> \n<p>“As human beings, we’re grateful for the support but we’re grateful above all to God because we’re here to share this experience, which really serves to show how much we need a path that leads to the welfare of each and every one of us.</p> \n<p>“To all of you who have been following this – our families, our friends, our colleagues and people elsewhere in the world – here we are.

            "body" : "<p>Four Daughters, a surreal blend of documentary, memory, meta-fictional re-enactment and therapy now shortlisted for an Oscar, originated years ago: in 2016, when a Tunisian woman named Olfa Hamrouni took to local news to call out her country’s failure to combat the scourge of Isis. And the year before that, when her two radicalized eldest daughters, Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui, fled to join the group in Libya. And the years before that, when Hamrouni struggled to raise her four daughters – the two eldest, rebellious and fiery; the two youngest, keen sponges of conflict – with an iron fist and a housekeeper’s salary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/20/four-daughters-review-fact-and-fiction-mix-in-mothers-heartbreak-over-islamic-state\">Four Daughters review – fact and fiction mix in mother’s heartbreak over Islamic State</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hamrouni first caught the eye of Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania on the news, pleading with authorities to repatriate her daughters from a Libyan prison in which they’ve been detained on suspicion of terrorist activities (and after a US anti-terror strike killed Rahma’s husband in 2016). Ben Hania was impressed by “her ability to tell her story”, she said. Hamrouni and her two younger daughters, Eya and Tayssir, “have the right words to describe their feelings, their story, their evolution of events”.</p> <p>Ben Hania, a feature film-maker with a background in documentary, sought “to dig behind those clips – that factual event – to dig into the past of this family” initially through a straightforward verité documentary. But she found the format insufficient in capturing the complexity of the situation, an emotional understanding of what would motivate Ghofrane and Rahma, teenage goths turned fundamentalists, to leave. The footage wasn’t good enough. (Hamrouni agreed, she said.) Years passed. Ben Hania gained international acclaim for her 2020 Arabic-language feature The Man Who Sold His Skin, nominated for a best international feature Oscar. She had her pick of projects yet returned to Tunisia, to speak again with Hamrouni and her two remaining daughters with a different approach: what if they hired actors to play the missing sisters?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUsu78a5phM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OUsu78a5phM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Four Daughters begins with this strange communion of fact and fiction, memory and performance: Eya and Tayssir, 11 and 8 when their sisters left and now in their late teens, meet actors Ichraq Matar and Nour Karoui, watch them don niqabs as Ghofrane and Rahma; all agree there’s a resemblance. The joyful reassembly of the family unit with Hamrouni quickly shifts to tears; Hamrouni is replaced with her own double, played by the Tunisian-Egyptian actor Hend Sabri, who confers with Hamrouni on how to play her memories. (A single man, Majd Mastoura, plays all the male roles – Hamrouni’s deadbeat husband/the girls’ alcoholic father, Hamrouni’s predatory ex-boyfriend, a Tunisian police officer – a decision of convenience also indicative of men’s disposability to this family.)</p> <p>Ben Hania was not a fan of re-enactment, the convention often used in documentary to frequently cheap, cheesy or distracting effect. “It’s fiction, it’s not documentary,” she said of the practice. Along with Hamrouni, Eya and Tayssir, she imagined something different: the women staging, even directing, re-enactments of their memories to accompany their first-person testimony, a search for catharsis, clarity or just some control through hybrid performance. (It helped that Hamrouni, long accused of faking her story, assumed that, ironically, her words would be more believed if a known actor like Sabri delivered them.) “I thought about hijacking the cliche and using it in another way,” said Ben Hania. “Using it like in theater – we are in the scene, trying to re-enact a memory from the past, so we bring the past to the present but also we question this memory.”</p> <p>The experiment has porous boundaries; on camera, the veil of performance slips on and off, as the participants break rank, character, time, fact. There are occasional news clips of Hamrouni in attack mode. Ben Hania keeps some of the meta scaffolding in – a debate between Sabri and Eya over whether to curse (it wouldn’t be accurate if they didn’t, argues Eya); the actors explaining how in post-revolution Tunisia, the head scarf went from a symbol of resistance to an instrument of control; a conversation between Hamrouni and Sabri over how much to personally engage in a history of pain. “I have learned to protect myself,” says Sabri. “And what if you can’t?” Hamrouni wonders. “If you can’t get the character out of your head? If they unnerve you, because they seem too real?”</p> <p>At times, the sisters appear as one happy, chatty family, the kind with whom you could talk about waxing, as Eya and Tayssir do, or play games imagining food that is not there. Hamrouni observes both from the doorframe, recalling the latter as some of her happiest memories. But the restagings do unearth a lineage of pain – steeped in misogyny, raised poor and forced into marriage, Hamrouni raised her daughters in fear of their sexuality. Beaten by both parents and constricted, Ghofrane and Rahma turned to fundamentalism as a source of freedom. Both Eya and Tayssir allude to sexual abuse by Hamrouni’s boyfriend in a scene where Eya carries a knife. Unnerved by the revelations, Majd, playing the ex-stepfather, walks out; Eya presses for him to return.</p>    <p>“It was an open discussion,” said Ben Hania of the shoot, which lasted for about four weeks at the same location in Tunisia, occasionally requiring off-camera discussions, restarts and redirections. “I have to react quickly to say OK, let’s not go there,” she said. “It was a very emotional shoot.”</p> <p>Hamrouni, in particular, emerges as a complex character, fearless in seeking her daughters, utterly outspoken, and yet fear-bound in raising them, alternatively sweet and withering, a woman of deep faith extremely skeptical of fundamentalism. “She had this contradiction where she is the incarnation and the guardian of the temple of the patriarchy, as an idea, as a concept,” said Ben Hania. “And she needed to do this, in a way, to protect herself and her daughters. But the opposite happens.”</p> <p>Survival tactics, carving out what power one can, the inextricable mark of patriarchy on one’s autonomy – one sees parallels to, say, anti-ERA activists in the US, or women across cultures who fight the things they also embody, or vice versa. “People may think: ‘Ah, they are Muslim,’ or something like this, but when we look close, it’s the manifestation of the same thing in different colors,” said Ben Hania.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are no definitive answers for why Ghofrane and Rahma left, just “keys”, as Ben Hania puts it. Nor is there a reunion, yet, for the family. Ben Hania and her team, along with Hamrouni, have continued to pressure the Tunisian government to repatriate the sisters and Ghofrane’s now eight-year-old daughter Fatma, who has spent her life in captivity. Ghofrane and Rahma have not seen the film, but received descriptions from their sisters via phone. Hamrouni, Eya and Tayssir remain hopeful for their return, according to the film’s coda. Until then, in Four Daughters, they take what healing they can find.</p> <ul> <li><p>Four Daughters is now available to rent digitally in the US and will be out in the UK on 22 March</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>On a chilly morning in Woodstock, New York, frozen dew turns lawns a glistening white as puffs of smoke from chimneys float across the road.</p> <p>“Winter is here,” declares the woodsman, a broad-shouldered man in a black-and-gray checked wool shirt and navy denim Carhartt overalls as he sharpens his orange chainsaw. Hanging from his neck is a medallion that reads “St Christopher protect us”– a gift from a red-carpet-level comedian who once collaborated with him on a theater project.</p> <p>The woodsman, who requested anonymity, is an accomplished director, writer and producer with several popular film and TV credits on his IMDb page. But he now devotes much of his time to supplying his struggling – and sometimes freezing – neighbors with free firewood.</p> <p>Think of him as a cross between Paul Bunyan and Banksy. He delivers seasoned hardwoods like birch, oak and his favorite, maple (“burns hot, burns clean”) often to elderly people, the ill, or both. Though he is quick with a quip, his soft voice hardens when discussing America’s insufficient safety net: “Heat in the winter,” he said. “It’s a human right.”</p>    <p>The Woodstock area is known for its thriving art scene as well as its famous former and current residents, including Bob Dylan, Levon Helm, Uma Thurman and David Bowie. But poverty festers amid the wealth.</p> <p>“Many people are suffering,” said the woodsman. “So many more than I imagined. Quietly, just secretly, really suffering.”</p> <p>The numbers back him up. Almost half of the children in the local public school district are <a href=\"https://wwe1.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/fiscalmonitoring/satfiles/2022/School/Environmental/Onteora_Env_22.pdf\">economically disadvantaged</a>, meaning that they or their families receive government anti-poverty aid such as supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap) or disability funds. Affordable housing is in short supply: there are only a handful of long-term rentals on Zillow in the 12498 zip code with an average price of nearly $4,000 per month.</p> <p>A cord (128 cubic feet) of firewood, about enough fuel for a month or two, costs between $250 and $350 in Ulster county – up from about $200 before Covid. According to the low income home energy assistance program (Liheap), which distributes block grants to the states for heating and cooling subsidies, <a href=\"https://www.liheap.org/white-paper\">18.6% of US households</a> “kept their home at a temperature that felt unsafe or unhealthy for at least one month in the past year”.</p> <p>And in the world’s wealthiest nation, some people freeze to death <a href=\"https://www.cbs42.com/digital-exclusive/midnight-in-mulga-how-an-alabama-man-froze-to-death-inside-his-family-home/\">inside their homes</a>.</p> <p>This year, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Edward Markey and Representative Jamaal Bowman introduced <a href=\"https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/news/press/release/gillibrand-cosponsors-bicameral-legislation-to-transform-liheap-to-provide-families-with-energy-assistance/\">ambitious (some might say doomed) legislation</a> to bolster federal heating programs. The proposal would cap expenditures on energy at 3% of a household’s income, allow applicants for energy aid to “self-attest to eligibility criteria” and ban utilities from shutting off power or charging late fees.</p> <p>For many Americans, warmth is just another unattainable luxury.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>The woodsman has been an active activist for several years, helping refugees in Mexico stay in safe houses, distributing free masks during Covid and organizing voter registration drives with <a href=\"https://thecomedyresistance.com/\">the Comedy Resistance</a>, a non-profit organization.</p> <p>He moved to upstate New York from Los Angeles a few years ago to look after his mother, who had cancer and then Covid. He stocked a paying stand, which operated on the honor system, outside his mother’s house with bundles of wood; she donated the proceeds to local charities. But some of the bundles of wood vanished. The thefts distressed the woodsman, who recalled that a friend “suggested that I put a sign out on the stand that says if you if you need wood to heat your home, but you don’t have the resources, just ask me and I will deliver”.</p> <p>That conversation sparked the free firewood program.</p> <p>Two local librarians, Hollie Ferrara of the Woodstock Library and Elizabeth Potter of the Phoenicia Library, voluntarily spread the word about the grassroots initiative. “Most people who work here can’t afford to live here,” said Ferrara. “But there are still outlying folks who have been in their homes for a long time who basically have just about just enough money to live on and that’s about it.” She acknowledged that librarians like her routinely act as unofficial social workers. “We wear many hats,” she said, quoting the official job description from her library’s HR department: “‘Other duties as assigned’; it’s a library joke.”</p>    <p>Residuals from the woodsman’s entertainment career defray some of his expenses. But Potter solicits donations for the charity from the community. Some benefactors leave gift cards for gasoline and stash them under a rock on her porch, or drop off oil for chainsaws.</p> <p>She first called on the woodsman during a power outage, a regular occurrence in upstate New York, two winters ago. An older couple had burned through their “last stick of wood”. Within hours, the woodsman came to the rescue. “They said they and their spouse were huddled under the blankets upstairs, the fire long gone out, freezing cold, when they saw headlights in their drive and the soul-warming sound of wood being thrown on to the gravel. He got them through until the power was restored.”</p> <p>The woodsman considers his volunteerism a cheap form of therapy. “I’m sort of a quiet guy,” he said. Giving away wood “does draw me out, pushes me out. When you interact with people, and I listen a lot, you do you learn their stories. And I’m moved by every one of them.”</p> <p>He often monitors his client’s firewood reserves and notices that he is receiving requests for help earlier this winter than last, a sign, he believes, of increasing economic struggle.</p> <p>When I visited him, he decided to check in with repeat customers who live about 20 minutes away from his wood lot. When driving on country roads, he eyed passing wood piles and offered reviews at 40 miles per hour. Commentary included “that shit is nowhere near seasoned” and “great logs”.</p>    <p>After arriving at the two-story house with a view of the mountains, he inspected a pile of logs strewn on the land to ensure they were not rotted. We then chatted in the house with Tom and Malley Heinlein, who had asked him to cut and split their wood.</p> <p>Tom, 74, always handled that chore until he nearly died in November 2022. “He’s from a family that did everything; I’ve never had to hire a plumber,” noted Malley as their dog, Nate, greeted visitors with cheerful barks. “I know pretty much all the building trades,” added Tom, a stonemason who became a registered nurse.</p> <p>Tom, the family’s main breadwinner, is gaunt and slowly recovering from <em>Mycobacterium </em><em>chelonae</em>, a severe bacterial infection, that sapped his strength and swelled his body. “We’ve been happily living our independent little quirky life for all this time,” Malley said wistfully. “And then all of a sudden, something trips you up.”</p> <p>Tom’s bed now dominates the living room, since he struggles to make it upstairs, let alone lift logs. “His whole body was inflated like a tick,” said Malley, a singer and former DJ who said Tom’s bloated condition had even shocked doctors.</p> <p>The couple quickly drained their modest savings and were resigned to toughing it out in the cold when a friend introduced them to the woodsman. A slight woman who also struggles with her health, Malley, 67, found applying for a heating subsidy daunting. “I’m taking care of [Tom]. And taking care of the dogs and taking care of the house ... He went from being my partner to being my patient.”</p>    <p>Stigma also fueled her reluctance to seek government heating aid. She recounted a “humiliating” episode when she once applied for financial assistance and her town assigned her a workfare job shoveling gravel, which she viewed as punitive. “I could have done filing,” she said.</p> <p>After a cup of coffee –“it’s important to accept hospitality,” the woodsman explained quietly – he methodically cut the long logs into manageable chunks. For another 15 minutes, he fiddled with the Heinleins’ malfunctioning electric splitter, before giving up and tossing 58 logs into his pickup bed. He owns a new and reliable hydraulic splitter, so he planned to return later in the afternoon with ready-to-burn wood. He hopes to one day boost his output by buying a dump truck and additional wood from other suppliers. There was plenty of demand, he fretted.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>The woodsman grew up in a liberal home in the rust belt. When he was a kid, his mom boycotted grapes to support Cesar Chavez and the strike by the United Farm Workers. “Why can’t we eat grapes, Mom?” he remembered asking. “No more grapes,” she shot back. But he credits a chance encounter with Rosa Parks in 1994 as inspiring his frontline activism. He had been directing a show on the road in Detroit, when his theater company booked him into a large corporate apartment complex.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/30/friends-homeless-nonprofit-miracle-messages-phone-buddy-san-francisco\">One was a tech VC, the other was unhoused. They forged an unlikely friendship in a deeply unequal city</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A mugger had recently <a href=\"https://womensenews.org/2013/02/1994-mugging-reveals-rosa-parks-true-character/\">attacked Parks</a>, then 81, in her home and she had moved into the same complex. The woodsman yearned to meet her, but he doubted that possibility: “She’s rehabilitating. I’m not gonna see her at the laundry.” One day, he noticed a package on his doorstep addressed to Parks. “I could see that [the package] had just spilled over from her door to my door. And I realized at that moment I’m living right nextdoor to Rosa Parks.”</p> <p>The next day, he knocked on the civil rights icon’s door to make sure that she had received the package. Her caretaker answered and asked, “Do you live nextdoor?’”</p> <p>“And I said, ‘Well, I’m here just for another week or so.’” The caretaker then explained that she was considering moving in full-time or expanding the apartment Parks lived in. “Do you think it would be OK,” the caretaker wondered, “if [Parks] came over for tea and looked at [your] place?”</p> <p>At the appointed time, Parks and her caregiver stopped by. “She looked diminutive, elderly,” he said, “with a nice sweater set.” She seemed a bit uncomfortable, though, and asked whether the air conditioning was on. He quickly offered to shut it off, which palpably pleased her. Her fragility touched him.</p> <p>“This is someone I read about in school and textbooks. But when you see someone like that, and the observation is trite, but she’s a real person and she looks like my grandmother or someone’s grandmother, it just inspired me to think that I can’t do what she did.”</p> <p>He chewed on that for a moment. “But anyone can do something, right?”</p>    <p><em>David Wallis is the co-editor of Going for Broke: Living on the Edge in the World’s Richest Nation (Haymarket)</em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>Nasa has postponed its plans to send humans to the moon after delays hit its hugely ambitious Artemis programme, which aims to get spaceboots bouncing again on the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.</p> \n<p>The US space agency has announced the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/artemis-iii/\">Artemis III</a> mission to land four astronauts near the lunar south pole will be delayed a year until September 2026. <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/\">Artemis II</a>, a 10-day expedition to send a crew around the moon and back to test life support systems, will also be pushed back to September 2025.</p> \n<p>Nasa said the delays would allow its teams to work through development challenges associated with the programme, which partners with private companies including Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Lockheed Martin and uses some largely untested spacecraft and technology.</p> \n<p>“We are returning to the moon in a way we never have before, and the safety of our astronauts is Nasa’s top priority as we prepare for future Artemis missions,” said the Nasa administrator Bill Nelson.</p> \n<p>Washington wants to establish a long-term human presence outside Earth’s orbit, including construction of a lunar base camp as well as a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission/gateway/\">space station that circles the moon</a>. Its ultimate plans are to send people to Mars, but it has decided to return to the moon first to learn more about deep space before embarking on what would be a months-long voyage to the red planet.</p> \n<p>Artemis I, the first mission of the programme, went ahead successfully in 2022, with Nasa launching the powerful <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/index.html\">Space Launch System</a> (SLS) rocket from Florida, carrying an uncrewed Lockheed-built Orion capsule on a 25-day, 1.3m-mile journey to the moon and back. It provided vital data for Nasa on what needed fixing, including the heat shield, part of which broke off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5670a6c7-aaa6-4479-a0c3-1b84145b002c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6jBScTfn8R0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The delay for the next missions will also give private companies, such as Axiom Space, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/spacesuit-for-nasas-artemis-iii-moon-surface-mission-debuts/\">which is designing the spacesuits</a>, more time to develop their technology.</p> \n<p>SpaceX is tasked with developing a lunar lander, which will fly to the moon without a crew and then meet astronauts into orbit, before taking them down to the surface. However, the company’s Starship system, the largest and most powerful rocket ever made, remains in early testing phases. Two flights have launched successfully but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/apr/20/elon-musks-spacex-launches-test-flight-for-rocket-that-could-bring-people-to-mars\">blown up at altitude</a>, although SpaceX says “failure” is part of its development process, allowing the profit-making company to take risks that government space agencies seeks to avoid.</p> \n<p>The new Nasa schedule “acknowledges the very real development challenges that have been experienced by our industry partners”, said Amit Kshatriya, the head of Nasa’s moon and Mars exploration strategy.</p> \n<p>Eugene Cernan, who visited the moon in 1972, was the last person to walk on Earth’s nearest neighbour. The Artemis programme seeks to land the first woman and first person of colour on the lunar surface.</p> \n<p>Jeffrey Alan Hoffman, a former Nasa astronaut and professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, said the delay was no surprise as there were still “a lot of things that have to be done”.</p> \n<p>“Space X’s Starship, which is going to ultimately bring the crew … down to the surface of the moon. I mean, Starship is yet to reach orbit,” Hoffman, who made five flights as a space shuttle astronaut, told the BBC.</p> \n<p>The astrophysicist said it was frustrating but not unexpected to see the delays, which he said were due to Nasa’s relatively tiny budget today compared with the space race of the 1960s and 1970s, when Washington sent humans to the moon for the first and last time on the Apollo programme.</p> \n<p>“Nasa’s budget for Apollo was huge. We had 400,000 people working on the Apollo project and Nasa doesn’t have anywhere near that level or resources now,” he said. “They are not going to launch until they are ready because crew safety is paramount.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A former post office operator who was convicted of false accounting as part of the Horizon IT scandal missed saying goodbye to his dying father because of a curfew related to his conviction.</p> <p>Mohammed Rasul, who was convicted of false accounting after an audit showed a shortfall of £12,000, said he became “a recluse” and had to wear a tag for three months after receiving a suspended 12-month sentence. “I have carried the shame ever since. I refuse to carry it any longer,” he said. Rasul said he missed saying goodbye to his dying father because of his curfew.</p> <p>From having a “full social life”, he cancelled his all his engagements, and saw only his children and wife. “Even my parents didn’t know, my siblings didn’t,” said Rasul. “Although I knew I hadn’t done it, it was just the stigma attached. You had to explain if anybody asked, what had happened. I just couldn’t explain that something had happened which was totally out of my control and I had to justify it or defend it.” He said he paid the shortfall. “Out of my savings, what little I had, and some borrowed money so I wouldn’t go to prison,” he said.</p> <p>Rasul was speaking on BBC Breakfast as part of a group of former Post Office staff who were victims of Horizon IT scandal and told of the shame and stigma they carried for years.</p> <p>Eight of those affected, and the son of a ninth, appeared on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, including Janet Skinner, who served three months of a nine-month custodial sentence for false accounting after a shortfall of £59,000.</p> <p>Skinner said: “It’s affected everything of my life going forward for the past 16 years.” Prison was “horrendous, just horrendous”.</p> <p>“I think it was harder, as well, because I had two teenagers,” she said. Newspaper reports of her prosecution saw her “just labelled a thief, anyway”. Thanks to the recent ITV drama, she said, there were “a lot of people out there who now understand what we have been through”.</p> <p>Tom Hedges, who ran a post office for 16 years near Skegness, had his 2010 conviction overturned in 2021. “Frankly it wrecked my life, my family’s lives. It was the most horrendous thing I’ve ever been through”. Over the years he was forced to pay back £60,000.</p> <p>He described how his estate agent daughter, who was selling a house, was forced to listen to the owners, unaware of who she was, berating “this terrible, awful man down at the post office, who’s stolen all the pensioners’ money, he’s a rogue, he only got a suspended, he should have been in prison, and thrown away the key’. It’s worse for your family than it was possibly for me.”</p> <p>He said his lawyer advised him to plead guilty to have a better chance of avoiding a prison sentence. “He said no jury in the land would believe an institution as cherished as the Post Office could possibly have a computer system that is rubbish.” He added of the prison threat: “Believe you me, I was petrified.”</p>    <p>Alison Hall, who ran a post office in Liversedge, West Yorkshire, was suspended after a shortfall of £15,000, and had a false accounting charge overturned three years ago. She said: “I couldn’t tell anybody the truth. It was only my family and close friends who knew the actual truth.” She added it has taken her “a long, long time to talk about it. I switched off.” She added: “It was just horrendous.”</p> <p>Scott Darlington, from Alderley Edge, who was convicted in 2010, said: “I couldn’t afford to pay for my daughter’s school uniform. I suffered awful stigma and embarrassment and financial distress ever since, and I am glad that things have come to a head and we are able to speak about it now.</p> <p>He wanted to plead not guilty but was also advised against it “because the Post Office held all the cards”. As a result “I just presumed everybody believed I had my hands in the till”. He added: “I knew I hadn’t done anything wrong. How am I supposed to get out if this situation? It’s taken all of these years to get to this point.” Darlington said those at fault now needed to be brought to account “otherwise it won’t feel like justice”.</p> <p>Varchas Patel, said his father, Vipin, was wrongfully prosecuted in 2011 over a £75,000 shortfall “and his health is completely shattered”. He had not yet received compensation. “His standing in the community went. There were “wanted, dead or alive posters” circulated in his Oxfordshire village. “At one point they even built a four-foot cross [and] placed a wreath on it on the village green, with RIP Vipin,” his son said. “They effectively saw my father as a Post Office robber.”</p> <p>Tim Brentnall, who ran a post office in Pembrokeshire was forced to pay back £22,500. “I was then prosecuted for false accounting until my conviction was quashed in 2021. My life was left in tatters and my customers and villagers thought I was a fraud.”</p> <p>Sally Stringer, who operated a rural post office for nearly 20 years, said if there was a shortfall, which was contested, “they take it out of your salary”. She added: “They really are beyond redemption, the Post Office, beyond redemption.”</p> <p>Maria, who gave only her first name, from Huddersfield, said: “I’m really happy now that the government say that they are listening.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The estimated cost of the HS2 line from London to Birmingham has ballooned to as much as £66bn, the scheme’s executive chair has told MPs.</p> <p>Jon Thompson told the transport select committee on Wednesday that the current estimate for the first phase of the line could add “between £8bn and £10bn” to the current top-end estimate of £56.6bn.</p> <p>The discrepancy in estimates is because the current £56.6bn price tag the government and HS2 have been quoting is in 2019 prices and does not reflect the jump in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Thompson’s testimony comes only months after Rishi Sunak announced at the Conservative party conference in October that he would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/04/rishi-sunak-conservative-conference-speech-hs2\">axing the planned HS2 line north of Birmingham</a>, citing cost concerns as the driving factor.</p> <p>The cost of the high-speed rail project has risen repeatedly in the last decade, with the line from London to Birmingham forecast to cost £19.4bn in 2013.</p> <p>Since then there have been a number of revisions, including the last one in November, where HS2 revealed that it now estimated the cost of the line to be between £49bn and £57bn.</p> <p>Thompson told MPs: “If you brought the estimate for 2019 prices up to 2023-24 prices, you’d be adding somewhere between £8bn and £10bn further [to the cost]. Construction inflation over the last three years has been 27% … steel has risen by 47%, rebar 53%, concrete 48%, and so on.”</p> <p>The government currently has a policy in which it only updates the prices for big infrastructure projects at spending reviews, meaning the HS2 phase 1 cost has stayed at a level <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/spending-review-2019-the-chancellors-key-points-at-a-glance\">put forward in September 2019</a>, when Sajid Javid was chancellor.</p> <p>Thompson was critical of this process, saying it created hassle for the organisation in converting all invoices and contracts into 2019 prices.</p> <p>“[It] is, to be frank with you, an administrative burden of some significance in the organisation because all of the invoices we get we have to then deflate backwards to 2019 prices even though we’re paying him at 2024 prices,” he said.</p> <p>“Then we have to adjust the accounts to account for that, so it is a significant administrative faff.”</p> <p>The HS2 boss said there were four main reasons for the steep cost increase over the years, including the increase in inflation and revisions to scope of the project since it first received parliamentary approval, with changes including more tunnelling through the Chilterns. He added that poor delivery by HS2 and its contractors on some of the major tunnelling and bridge projects along the line had added to costs.</p> <p>Thompson said the fourth driver of cost increases was down to “systemic problems” with the way the country delivered large infrastructure projects, claiming that budgets were often set before the true scale of the works were known.</p> <p>He said: “The budget needs to be set early on in order for an outline business case to be approved by the government.</p> <p>“The original estimate for phase 1 [of HS2] was £30bn, something that is based on very, very immature data. You don’t have a design; you haven’t procured anything. There is no detail in which you can cost anything.”</p> <p>A DfT spokesperson said: “This government is bearing down on the cost of HS2 and reviewing the scope of phase one to deliver the line at the lowest reasonable price for taxpayers.</p> <p>“We have already taken decisive action by cancelling phase two of HS2, reinvesting every penny of the £36bn saved in local transport projects that will benefit more people in more places, more quickly.”</p>",

The anxiety that can attend this art form falls away, in the company of artists fully in control of the flow of their impulses and off-the-cuff ideas. That’s the case with this Chicago quartet, who arrive boasting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/05/bill-murray-tina-fey-improv-comedy-masterclass-second-city\">Second City</a> credentials, a founding role (alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/10/amy-poehler-parks-and-rec-is-one-of-those-comedies-people-medicate-with\">Amy Poehler</a>) in the Upright Citizens Brigade, and TV credits including Veep, SNL and The Good Place.</p> <p>Their improvising touch is sure, then – even if the format isn’t. They’re here to “bring long-form improv to the UK”, they tell us, but what follows is suspended somewhere between sketch comedy and long-form as usually understood. Expats don’t improvise a full-length story with a beginning, middle and end. They take themes and ideas from the audience, riff on them with recurring characters in loosely connected scenes – then reboot the process and start again.</p> <p>It’s a format that tantalises then withholds the prospect of a narrative satisfaction, a uniting of all the disparate parts. Which – once you accept that’s what you’re getting – is fine. The quality of the performances, the vividness of the characters, the smoothness of the repartee – it’s all so delectable, I still found myself chuckling from start to finish. Tonight, we get a hapless barfly beaten up for his views on the climate crisis, a motorist cruising a posh party seeking sponsors for his purchase of a Bentley, and a ghostly grandpa hijacking a house sale.</p> <p>That spectral visitation (played by first-among-equals Brad Morris) is greeted nonchalantly by the other performers on stage, which feels like a misstep. These grizzled veterans tend towards the sardonic, and, in improv terms, that can sometimes feel like blocking or lowering the stakes. There’s a special guest each night, too, which, for all that Rich Fulcher’s contribution was amusing enough, feels like a gimmicky add-on. No additions are required to this troupe of improv lifers, whose consummate interplay and keen but composed instinct for the funny deliver a substantial comic – if not narrative – payload.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/events/expats/\">Soho theatre, London</a>, until 13 January</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>Congress members who were more supportive of Israel at the start of the Gaza war received over $100,000 more on average from pro-Israel donors during their last election than those who most supported Palestine, a Guardian analysis of campaign data shows.</p> \n<p>Those who took more money most often called for US military support and backed Israel’s response, even as Gaza’s civilian death toll mounted, the findings show. The analysis, which looks at positions taken during the war’s first six weeks, does not prove any particular member changed their position because they received pro-Israel campaign donations. However, some campaign finance experts who viewed the data argue that donor spending helped fuel Congress’s overwhelming support for Israel.</p> \n<p>The analysis compared campaign contributions from pro-Israel groups and individuals to almost every member of the current Congress with each lawmaker’s statements on the war through mid-November.</p> \n<p>About 82% of Congress members were more supportive of Israel, and just 9% more supportive of Palestine during this period. The remainder had “mixed” views. Legislators categorized as supportive of Israel received about $125,000 on average during their last election, while those supportive of Palestine on average took about $18,000.</p> \n<p>The volume and breadth of the donors’ spending is considerable: over $58m went to current Congress members, and all but 33 received donations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/12/archive-zip/giv-134257Zq7PzemzsRN/\" data-alt=\"Three clusters of dots representing members of Congress and their donations received from pro-Israel donors\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/12/archive-zip/giv-134257Zq7PzemzsRN/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The findings have “profound implications for what American policy toward … Israel looks like”, said John Mearsheimer, a University of Chicago political scientist and co-author of the 2006 book The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy. “If there was no lobby pushing Congress in a particular direction in a really forceful way, the position of the US Congress on the war in Gaza would be fundamentally different.”</p> \n<p>The groups’ campaign contributions have varying goals depending on the member. Spending can be “defensive” or “shore up support” in Congress for allies who already share pro-Israel groups’ views, said Sarah Bryner, a spokesperson for Open Secrets, which tracks campaign finance spending and collected the contributions data used in the Guardian’s analysis. Spending can also be “offensive”, or intended to persuade a lawmaker to take a pro-Israel position, campaign finance observers and political strategists who reviewed the data said.</p> \n<p>The donors’ highest profile <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/12/aipac-accused-of-islamophobia-after-attacks-on-ilhan-omar\">battles</a> have involved members of the “<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2023/12/05/aoc-aipac-squad-book/\">The Squad</a>”, like Representatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/10/ilhan-omar-minnesota-primary-victory-progressives\">Ilhan Omar</a> and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/06/10/rashida-tlaib-urban-empowerment-action-pac-bakari-sellers/\">Rashida Tlaib</a>, who are among the most critical of Israel. But statements from Representatives Don Bacon, Dan Kildee and André Carson in the wake of the 7 October attack in which 1,200 Israelis were killed help illustrate varying levels of donations and responses across Congress.</p> \n<p>All three first strongly condemned the assault’s perpetrators and expressed deep sympathy for the victims, but their messaging quickly diverged.</p> \n<p>Bacon, who received about $250,000, offered full-throated <a href=\"https://bacon.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1346\">support</a> for Israel: “Whatever Israel wants … we should be there to help.”</p> \n<p>Carson, who received $3,000, took aim at Israel, <a href=\"https://carson.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-carson-statement-deaths-israel-and-palestine\">denouncing</a> its “unfair, two-tiered rule over the Palestinian people” and demanded a ceasefire.</p> \n<p>Kildee, who received $91,000, fell somewhere in between, <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2023/11/02/israel-hamas-war-gaza-humanitarian-aid-crisis/71395781007/\">underscoring</a> “Israel’s security and its right to respond” and his ”grave concern” over its airstrikes killing thousands of Palestinian civilians.</p> \n<p>Included in the analysis are<strong> </strong>33 pro-Israel groups and a number of individuals<strong> </strong>that work to shore up US political support, secure military assistance and steer national dialogue. Its prominent campaign finance players include the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), Democratic Majority For Israel (DMFI), and J Street.</p> \n<p>The donors are not ideologically monolithic. J Street, which calls itself “pro-Israel and pro-peace” and is considered among the most liberal Pacs, only gave to Democrats, and in some cases backed progressive candidates targeted by more conservative Pacs, like Aipac or DMFI. While donors across the spectrum have <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/j-street-israel-gaza-resolution/\">pressured lawmakers</a> to support Israel following 7 October, J Street has been among the only group <a href=\"https://jstreet.org/press-releases/j-street-calls-on-biden-administration-to-address-humanitarian-crisis-in-gaza-stress-adherence-to-international-law/\">to raise</a> concern about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and express <a href=\"https://jstreet.org/press-releases/j-street-to-lobby-for-van-hollen-arms-accountability-amendment-to-the-supplemental/\">support</a> for conditioning aid to Israel.</p> \n<p>The groups are a powerful force in US politics that draw comparisons to the National Rifle Association (NRA) at the peak of its power, and spent more on the 2022 Congress than other special interests, such as the oil and gas industry.</p> \n<p>The former president Barack Obama, in his 2020 memoir, detailed the threat Aipac presents to Israel’s critics, who risked “being tagged as ‘anti-Israel’ (and possibly anti-Semitic) and confronted with a well-funded opponent in the next election”, he wrote.</p> \n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, an Aipac spokesperson, Marshall Wittmann, said the group is “proud of our engagement in the democratic process – as is our right as Americans – to advance the relationship between the US and Israel”.</p> \n<p>The donors’ success rate is often high: DMFI-backed candidates won over 80% of their 2022 races, the group <a href=\"https://dmfipac.org/who/about/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20DMFI%20PAC%20finished,pro%2DIsrael%20Democrats%20to%20Congress.\">says</a>. Pacs such as DMFI and Aipac’s United Democracy Project, which was launched during the 2022 cycle, have focused attacks on progressive candidates.</p> \n<p>The top six recipients of pro-Israel donor support in 2022 were centrist Democrats who defeated progressives in primaries and collectively accounted for around $25m, or about 42% of the donors’ spending.</p> \n<h2><strong>What we found</strong></h2> \n<p>To determine whether lawmakers were supportive of Israel, Palestine or had a mixed response, the Guardian examined officials’ media statements, X accounts and letters to Joe Biden from 7 October through mid-November.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"96fbd792-3107-4098-9520-2e5f1c6f1e1d\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian developed six broad statement categories that indicated support for Israel or Palestine, including “called for US military support”, “supported Israel’s response”, “acknowledged Israeli civilian victims”, “criticized Israel’s response,” contextualized the war”, and “acknowledged Palestinian civilian victims”.</p>\n    <p>If a lawmaker made more statements that fit into categories that indicated support for Israel, then they were characterized as “supportive of Israel”, and vice versa. If a legislator made the same number of statements supportive of Israel and Palestine, their position was characterized as “mixed”. The Guardian looked at responses through mid-November.</p>\n    <p>An example of a representative who is more supportive of Israel is Representative Don Bacon. On 11 October, he told Military.com: “Whatever Israel wants, they should ask us, and we should be there to help.” He did not close the door on possible US military involvement in the war. In a 7 October tweet, he expressed his sympathy for Israeli civilian victims. In a 15 November tweet, he defended Israel’s attacks on Gaza hospitals, arguing that they were used as bases for Hamas. He has repeatedly stated his opposition to a ceasefire, and highlighted Israel’s “right to defend itself” in the weeks following 7 October.</p>\n    <p>An example of a representative who is more pro-Palestine is Representative Andre Carson. In a 10 October statement, he acknowledged civilian victims on both sides and contextualized the war. He said he mourns “the loss of all innocent lives in Israel and Palestine, and my heart goes out to the families of those who lost loved ones, especially the loss of children\".</p>\n    <p>He added: “This latest escalation of violence painfully demonstrates the urgent need for just and lasting peace. To achieve this, the US must rededicate ourselves and our resources to a real two-state solution, and call for the end of Israel’s unfair, two-tiered rule over the Palestinian people. This includes concrete steps to preserve the future of a Palestinian state.”</p>\n    <p>He later signed on to a resolution calling for a ceasefire. He has not supported Israel’s response or called for military aid.</p>\n    <p>The designation of “more supportive of Palestine” does not imply that the lawmaker is “anti-Israel”, or vice versa.</p>\n    <p>The Guardian used campaign finance data from the nonpartisan, nonprofit Open Secrets. It looked at contributions from the 2022 election cycle. For senators who did not have an election in 2022, the Guardian looked at their most recent election cycle. Members who were elected in special elections following the November 2022 midterm were not included.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The unprecedented moment in US-Israeli relations has helped lay bare the extent of Congress’s support for Israel.</p> \n<p>The analysis of Congress members’ responses in this period<strong> </strong>found:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>93% called for US military or financial support for Israel.</p></li> \n <li><p>81% supported Israel’s response.</p></li> \n <li><p>17% criticized Israel or called for a ceasefire.</p></li> \n <li><p>17% contextualized the war, meaning they raised issues like Israeli settlement expansion or human rights violations in Gaza that preceded the 7 October attack.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Some legislators’ positions have shifted as a humanitarian crisis deepened and Israeli attacks caused mass civilian casualties.

Over recent decades, Israel likely would have been unable to carry out many of its inflammatory policies, like settlement expansion, without a “pro-Israel lobby” to help secure US arms and political support, he said.</p> \n<p>Ideas such as US sanctions, withholding military aid or the US sponsoring a critical United Nations Security Council resolution are “complete science fiction” in large part because of the groups’ influence, Walt added.</p> \n<p>Many of the pro-Israel groups have opposed Palestinian statehood, and played a significant role in derailing peace processes, Mearsheimer said.</p> \n<p>“If the lobby had worked with any administrations to allow presidents to pressure Israel to produce an agreement that led to a Palestinian state, then we probably would not be in this disastrous situation,” he said.</p> \n<p>Some groups mobilized against representatives who supported Palestinian statehood. In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/haley-stevens/summary?cid=N00040915\">Aipac</a> supported the ouster of the former representative Andy Levin, a Jewish progressive and self-described Zionist, in part<strong> </strong>over his proposed bill calling for a two-state solution and “an end to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories”.</p> \n<p>Ahead of Levin’s primary, Aipac’s former president <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-head-of-aipac-calls-jewish-michigan-congressman-corrosive-to-us-israel-ties/\">sent out</a> a fundraising pitch calling Levin’s race against centrist Representative Haley Stevens a “rare opportunity to defeat arguably the most corrosive member of Congress to the US-Israel relationship”.</p> \n<p>The race turned into a battle between conservative and liberal donor groups: donors poured nearly $5.4m into backing Stevens. She easily beat Levin, who was backed with about $700,000 in J Street support. The Guardian analysis found Stevens to be among the staunchest supporters of Israel’s response – she was one of just <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4291422-these-12-democrats-bucked-their-party-to-support-gops-israel-aid-bill/\">12 Democrats</a> who broke with the party to vote for a GOP Israel assistance bill that did not include humanitarian aid for Gaza.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/archive-zip/giv-13425BbFjKIhUmn4x/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/archive-zip/giv-13425BbFjKIhUmn4x/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Congress members who were more supportive of Palestinian causes or more neutral prior to being elected, like Senator John Fetterman, Representative <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/10/16/democratic-party-progressive-israel-aipac-dmfi\">Maxwell Frost</a> and Senator <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/01/01/warnock-israel-dmfi-senate\">Raphael Warnock</a>, shifted to take more pro-Israel positions after pro-Israel groups made donations, or threatened to get involved in a race. The Guardian found Fetterman and Warnock to be more supportive of Israel following the 7 October attacks, while Frost had a mixed response and has signed onto a resolution calling for a ceasefire.</p> \n<p>The DMFI president, Mark Mellman, said the analysis does not prove that pro-Israel donor contributions influenced Congress’s position or caused any lawmaker to change their views on Israel. Anyone who posits that is “an advocate, not an analyst”, he said.</p> \n<p>“I’m in favor of changing how it works, but it works that way for every issue, for every progressive issue, for every conservative issue, so there is absolutely nothing unique about pro-Israel community in this respect,” he said. “Not acknowledging that would be antisemitic.”</p> \n<p>Campaign finance experts noted that some congressional donations are given to members because they already share a position, raising a “chicken or egg” question about the role of the money in members’ views. Bacon, a former Air Force colonel, said Israel has strategic value to the US and noted he is an evangelical with a “spiritual connection” to Israel.</p> \n<p>Dozens of evangelicals serve in Congress, and Bacon said the question of supporting Israel “is a matter of the heart” for many people like him.</p> \n<p>“My support comes from the time I was five years old and my dad said ‘Those who bless Israel will be blessed’ which is right out of the Old Testament,” Bacon told the Guardian.</p> \n<h2><strong>At odds with the public</strong></h2> \n<p>The analysis also highlights how most of Congress is in line with conservative pro-Israel positions – but not with those of the US public. While the Guardian found just 17% of Congress was critical of Israel or called for a ceasefire in the first six weeks of the war, US polls <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-public-support-israel-drops-majority-backs-ceasefire-reutersipsos-2023-11-15/#:~:text=Some%2032%25%20of%20respondents%20in,conducted%20Oct.%2012%2D13.\">show</a> up to 68% of Americans <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2023/10/19/voters-agree-the-us-should-call-for-a-ceasefire-and-de-escalation-of-violence-in-gaza\">support a ceasefire</a>, and around 80% of Democrats.</p> \n<p>“There is no question” pro-Israel donor contributions spread across Congress drive the disparity, said James Zogby, a pollster and founder of the Arab American Institute. But he believes this is not a matter of more robust public debate because “if you raise the issue of money then you run the risk of being called an antisemite,” he added.</p> \n<p>The Guardian identified 132 legislators who received less than $10,000 in backing, including 33 who received $0, but are still supportive of Israel. While that includes some Republicans who are ideologically aligned with groups like Aipac, some experts who reviewed the data believe it points to the donors’ strength.</p> \n<p>Their vast spending instills fear across Congress, and Aipac is the “elephant in the room” in Democratic campaigns, said Waleed Shahid, a progressive strategist who said consultants have advised candidates to publicly take pro-Israel positions to placate pro-Israel donors.</p> \n<p>“There aren’t that many lobbies that are willing to spend millions of dollars to unseat you in a primary,” Shahid added.</p> \n<p>Moreover, most lawmakers represent districts with very few Jewish or Arab American constituents to pressure them on votes, and there is virtually no pro-Palestine lobby to counterweight, Mearsheimer noted. That makes it easier and safer for lawmakers to take pro-Israel positions, he added.</p> \n<p>The 2022 primary in North Carolina’s first congressional district encapsulated those issues. Relatively few Jews or Arab Americans live in the area, and the Democratic representative Don Davis, armed with about $2.8m in donor support, defeated a more progressive candidate before winning in the general election.</p> \n<p>Davis, fresh off a junket trip to Israel funded by Aipac in August, was one of 10 Democrats who in November broke with the party to vote to censure Tlaib and support the GOP Israel funding bill that did not include humanitarian aid for Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Other Congress members have shifted positions or “been silenced on Palestine only because they were afraid of the wrath of Aipac,” said Usamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, which backs progressive candidates.</p> \n<p>Democrats on average received more money than Republicans. Those who the Guardian found were supportive of Israel on average received about $243,000 compared with $52,000 for their GOP counterparts.</p> \n<p>The next election promises more of the same. A pro-Israel donor has allegedly already offered $20m in backing for someone to run against Tlaib, the nation’s only Palestinian American lawmaker. Representative Jamaal Bowman, who is backed by J Street, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/bowman-primary-latimer-00130279\">faces</a> a challenger who will likely receive support from more conservative pro-Israel groups.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Representative Summer Lee, who, with around $38,000 in J Street support, defeated a candidate backed with millions in funding from more conservative pro-Israel groups, is again facing a challenge from a more pro-Israel candidate.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most vocal critic of Aipac has been Representative Mark Pocan, who received $5,500 in pro-Israel funding, and in November <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/11/aipac-israel-gaza-netanyahu-mark-pocan.html\">said</a> he did not “give a fuck about Aipac”, labelling it a “cancer” in US politics.</p> \n<p>The group took GOP dark money and spent it in Democratic primaries, often at levels exceeding candidate spending, and across a high number of races, Pocan said. As the strategy pays dividends on the war, he fears it will be copied by other powerful lobbies, which he said could be a “deathblow to democracy”.</p> \n<p>“If outside groups – especially in primaries where so much less money is spent – decide to purchase elections and make them auctions, that really will change the character of Congress in a very negative way,” Pocan said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Alan Turing’s life was without doubt dramatic, from the cracking of the Enigma code and breakthroughs in computing to his prosecution for homosexuality. The 2014 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/13/the-imitation-game-review-cumberbatch-turing\">The Imitation Game</a> is proof that his life makes for thrilling storytelling.</p> <p>The decision to set it to music in this two-hander is harder to fathom and the raison d’etre for Joel Goodman and Jan Osborne’s musical, as a whole, remains a mystery. The production is an emotionless survey of a life with weak songs, a thin book by Joan Greening and glacial pacing from director Jane Miles. Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that its words were originally extracted from Turing’s letters and academic papers.</p> <p>It is puzzling too that the show has played, in different incarnations, since 2022 yet has the halting quality of a rehearsal. Joe Bishop is a too-understated Turing, pausing and mumbling so some lines are difficult to catch. Zara Cooke puts more energy into playing every other character, from Turing’s mother to his (brief) fiancee Joan Clarke.</p>    <p>The script skims through his life, from Cambridge to Princeton to Bletchley Park, but leaves holes. We hear that the young Turing is “slow” in class, but in the next scene he is graduating with a first. His best friend at school, Christopher, dies of TB and a song suggests Turing was sexually attracted to him, but it teems with opaque lyrics: “The exponential way I feel is the paradox of loving him.”</p> <p>The songs are at first forgettable, then dreary and finally whiny, the awkward lyrics laden with mathematics. The voices are thin, sometimes alarmingly out of tune, and the glut of songs gives the singers nowhere to hide. Although Bishop and Cooke wear microphones, they are still difficult to hear at times.</p> <p>We get to Turing’s sexuality in the latter part of the production, when he is convicted of gross indecency and chemically castrated. His suicide is dramatised through a letter, written by Turing’s brother and read out by his mother, but all the drama is leeched from it. Even at 80 minutes, the production drags and the only enigma here is how Turing’s life could be turned so dull.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://riversidestudios.co.uk/see-and-do/alan-turing-a-musical-biography-95097/\">Riverside Studios, London</a>, until 27 January</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>Boca Juniors is undoubtably one of the most iconic clubs in South American football, whether on the men’s or the women’s side. Based in Buenos Aires, the women’s team have dominated domestically in the semi-professional era and won their fourth consecutive Argentinian end-of-year title in December.</p> <p>However, all is not rosy. There are many challenges for women’s football in Argentina and that ends up having an effect on Boca’s results internationally. “Boca have made history, especially recently,” the Argentinian journalist Sofia Jaimez Bertazzo points out. “The level they have achieved individually and collectively is incredible and is not only reflected in the titles won but also in the players that go abroad from them.” One such example is Yamila Rodríguez, who was signed by the Brazilian side Palmeiras after the two clubs had played in the Libertadores final in 2022.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2024/jan/09/the-100-best-female-footballers-in-the-world-2023\">The 100 best female footballers in the world 2023 – Nos 100-41</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Argentinians are passionate about football it has taken decades for the women’s game reached some level of professionalism. It was not until 2019 that the country’s FA and the players’ union made the “professionalisation of the women’s game” official. Almost five years later, according to a report by Argentinian fact-checking agency Chequeado, more than 40% of players in the top division are still amateur. In fact, in 2023 none of the first division clubs had a 100% professional squad. Boca are one of five clubs to have over 20 professional players but the overall picture means that the level of the league, although improving, is still lower than the one in Brazil, for example.</p> <p>Things are changing slowly and there has been an increase in interest in the women’s game among the public and the media. “Lately in Argentina the audience has changed and we see more fans in the stadiums when there are women’s games,” says Bertazzo. “And the last Women’s World Cup had a lot of attention in the media and a lot of journalists travelled to New Zealand and Australia to report on what was happening. This gives a lot of people an opportunity to get closer to the game.”</p> <p>Argentina featuring in another Women’s World Cup this year was fundamental – and the public TV broadcaster, Televisión Pública, saw record-breaking audiences for Argentina’s group stage games at the tournament. Over the past few years, clubs in South America have increased their investment in women’s football. For national sides to improve though, as Bertazzo says, the decision-making process needs to change. “Basically, these are the leadership decisions that can see us do better internationally. It is a long process, but it is happening.”</p> <p>It is clear that Boca are ahead of the curve at the moment – and they hope that the recent change in leadership may consolidate that success. In December, the former player Juan Román Riquelme won the elections to become president of the<em> Xeneize</em>. Days before the polls opened he attended Boca Women’s 2-0 win over Belgrano in which the club secured their second title of the year. Having a legend of the men’s team supporting the women’s team should be a good sign for the future of the <em>Gladiadoras</em>.</p> <p>“Of course, he is such as strong icon in the club and in people’s hearts as a player but now we have to see how the leader Riquelme works. But expectations are high,” says Bertazzo. However, she prefers not to predict how Riquelme’s leadership will affect the women’s side. “I just can say that, as a Boca idol, he should continue to support his female players and to improve their conditions.”</p>    <p>And there is work to do. Boca’s Argentinian dominance is still not reflected on the international scene. An Argentinian side have never won the Copa Libertadores Femenina, the club competition for women’s sides in South America. In 2022, Boca reached the final against Palmeiras but lost the final 4-0. Of the 15 editions of the Libertadores, 12 have been won by a Brazilian club with Colombia, Paraguay and Chile claiming a title each. In 2023, Boca failed to reach the knockout stage, finishing third in their group.</p> <p>“Having these international experiences gives Boca another perspective compared to other teams in Argentina. This increased international challenge demands that they improve to get results they want,” says Bertazzo. “The women’s game in Argentina needs better infrastructure, better salaries, sponsors for the national women’s team and more frequent camps and matches.”</p> <p>The challenges are not only external. Boca have faced major changes over the past year and in April 2023, the former coach Jorge Daniel Martínez was accused of sexual abuse by a club employee. He denies the accusations but was replaced by the former player Florencia Quiñones, who went on to win the two national tournaments of the year. They were the team’s 27th and 28th national titles.</p> <p>“We live in a region where football is still really ingrained into the masculine, but this has been changing,” says Bertazzo. “There are clubs, such as Boca, who decided to invest in their women, give them better conditions and have more professional players in the squad. That raises the bar.”</p> <h2><strong>Get in touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters, please email <a href=\"mailto:moving.goalposts@theguardian.com\">moving.goalposts@theguardian.com</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

But the latest update on Paquetá, who is seeing a specialist, will force them into the market for attacking additions. They are tracking the Ajax winger Steven Bergwijn and the Sunderland winger Jack Clarke and have a longstanding interest in the Paris Saint-Germain forward Hugo Ekitike. Sporting’s Marcus Edwards is another player of interest.</p> <p>The most pressing issue, though, is that West Ham have been telling industry insiders they do not have much money available. They have spent heavily in recent windows and although they sold Declan Rice to Arsenal for £105m last summer they are close to their financial fair play limit.</p> <p>Another issue is whether West Ham, who are sixth in the Premier League and in the last 16 of the Europa League, can bring in a player capable of making an immediate impact. Sunderland will not want to sell Clarke, who is vital to their promotion hopes, and the 23-year-old could find making the step up from the Championship difficult. Bergwijn disappointed at Tottenham before joining Ajax.</p> <p>There will be pressure on Tim Steidten, West Ham’s technical director, to attack the toughest situation he has faced since joining the club last summer. There is not a lack of depth in attack. Instead the issue is that the players in reserve offer nowhere near the same quality as the favoured front three of Paquetá, Bowen and Kudus.</p> <p>Moyes can choose from Saïd Benrahma, Maxwel Cornet, Danny Ings, Divin Mubama and Pablo Fornals. Benrahma, Ings and Fornals are up for sale. Any outgoings would bolster West Ham’s spending power.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>James Meadway is an economist who is not at all impressed with economics. Formerly an adviser to John McDonnell when he was Labour shadow chancellor, Meadway has plenty to say about what mainstream economics gets wrong. But one of his central gripes is the way it treats the environment. “We cannot simply pretend that … the entire ecological crisis is a separate and distinct thing from what’s happening in the economy,” says Meadway, who now works on climate finance. And yet that is precisely what happens.</p> <p>This critique informs the podcast, Macrodose, which Meadway presents and which has recently turned one year old. Its tagline is “Your weekly fix of climate economics”. Every Wednesday, in 15 minutes or so, Meadway analyses the key economic stories of the week. Part of the aim is to make economics more accessible because, he says, it is often thought of as something so difficult that “you have to be really clever to do it”. </p> <p>Macrodose also grew out of Meadway’s increasing frustration with how the environment was either neglected altogether or mishandled by economists. What you have is reporting on these extreme weather events, he says, gesturing to one side, and then separately, motioning “over here”, the discussion around what’s going on in the economy.</p>    <p>Meadway has a matter-of-fact tone that makes him sound pretty convincing, and the podcast has had close to 200,000 listens across more than 60 countries, with an average audience of roughly 7,000 a week. So suited is his voice for the disembodied world of podcasting that it’s a little odd to sit in the offices of Planet B – the company that produces the podcast – and listen to him speak in person.</p> <p>Meadway gives numerous examples of the disconnect between economics and the environment in popular discourse. For example, a large part of the recent surge in inflation was the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he says, but it was also “pretty insistently, certainly over the last summer, things like various major water transport riverways in Europe drying up because it was so hot”. He points to the Panama Canal, where a drought means fewer ships can use it, so they either have to wait or go all the way round South America. This drives up the cost of transporting goods and this has a knock-on effect on prices in the shops. We can expect more of this, he warns.</p> <p>In one episode, he explains that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecbs-lagarde-climate-change-has-clear-impact-inflation-2022-08-25/\">some financial institutions are starting to catch up</a> to this but that their response is still lacklustre. He laments the fact that most of the discussion is focused on putting up interest rates to deal with inflation – Meadway thinks this is a “disastrous” idea that will make no difference “to how much water there is in the Rhine”, one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/12/germany-drought-rhine-water-levels-new-low\">Europe’s rivers that dried up</a> over the summer.</p>    <p>Meadway started thinking about the climate because it was unavoidable; it was everywhere he looked. And he thought it unsatisfactory that economics was not addressing it enough or in the right way.</p> <p>But this hardly came as a surprise. As a student, he arrived at the London School of Economics eager to understand why some people are incredibly rich and others are not, but instead his undergraduate economics degree was three years of “relatively difficult maths” that had “absolutely no immediate reference to a whole list of real-world problems you might face”.</p> <p>Others agree. In 2014, economics students around the world wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/university-economics-teaching-lobotomy-non-mainstream\">manifesto criticising the narrow way economics was taught</a>, pinpointing a “lack of intellectual diversity”. Beyond universities, the <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/economists-urge-bbc-rethink-inappropriate-reporting-uk-economy\">BBC was criticised by a group of economists</a> in 2020 for inappropriately describing the country’s economy like that of a household. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64453200\">subsequent report found</a> “too many journalists lack understanding of basic economics or lack confidence reporting”.</p> <p>​​After the 2008 financial crisis, Meadway says that the economics curriculum has improved. Still, aside from ecological economists – he mentions EF Schumacher – as a discipline, he says, it remains “kind of useless on things like climate change”. Most likely you’ll still be taught that the environment is an externality to the economy.</p> <p>What exactly does that mean for the way many economists understand the ecological crisis? Meadway gives the example of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: if you accept they are harmful, you might increase the price of carbon, believing this will change how the economy operates and in turn affect the environment. Carbon pricing, as it’s known, has been roundly criticised by certain academics and economists for, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/putting-a-price-on-nature-is-wrong\">failing to work</a> and failing to meet the scale of the challenge. The problem, Meadway explains, is that it treats the environment as subordinate to humanity’s actions; as if it’s at “our beck and call” to be “exploited” at will. “Once you have floods and wildfires,” he says, “that is the environment imposing itself on us, it’s not intellectually credible to start to think only that we have a problem to deal with. In fact, the problem is dealing with us.”</p> <p>Meadway is not just telling listeners that industrial capitalism is responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/21/what-is-climate-change#:~:text=Any%20process%20that%20causes%20adjustments,climate%20change%20caused%20by%20humans.\">anthropogenic climate breakdown</a> – he describes this as accepted by “pretty much everyone” – but on focusing on the feedback this produces. What happens after we’ve “merrily burned” huge amounts of coal and oil and polluted every river and sea on the planet, he asks.</p> <p>This doesn’t just puncture economic orthodoxy – Meadway’s critique is also aimed at parts of the left that are committed to maintaining current levels of consumption, just in a supposedly environmentally sound way.</p> <p>The idea that we can all have an electric car is, according to him, just not possible: “There is not enough copper on the planet … We can’t get the lithium to produce the batteries, these things can’t actually happen.”</p>    <p>Or consider semiconductors – the focus of one Macrodose episode. Semiconductors are essential to almost all electronics on the planet but producing them requires huge amounts of water, he explains. When there was a drought in Taiwan, where one of the factories that produces 90% of the world’s semiconductors is based, it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/04/19/1170425349/epic-drought-in-taiwan-pits-farmers-against-high-tech-factories-for-water\">had to restrict production</a>. There is not an “endless bounty that we can magically exploit”, Meadway says.</p> <p>Radicals as well as the mainstream need to accept “the relationship of humanity to nature isn’t a simple hierarchy”, he says. What we are seeing is “the effects of environmental crisis” being “mediated through the structures of capitalism”.</p> <p>This certainly feels a long way away from how most UK politicians talk about the subject. Given this is a world he used to inhabit, I wonder what he would now say to Labour, the party he used to work for. His number one piece of advice: “Stop talking about growth”. They do it to sound “economicsy”, he says, but it’s “totally unspecific” and that growth is actually quite hard to achieve. Growth cannot be relied on to “produce the goods it used to produce for all of us”, he says, so “you have to start having an argument about redistribution” instead.</p> <p>“We’re just not going to have so much growth in the future because of the climate crisis,” he says. If we run out of food and there are extreme water shortages, where is the growth going to come from, he asks. “There isn’t some technology we can invent that can make that happen.” </p> <p>Meadway wants Labour to “get the basics right”, such as explaining who they’re going to tax to fund public spending and detail what they are going to spend the money on.</p> <p>Does he, then, think degrowth, which argues for reducing and changing current forms of production and consumption in a way that lessens environmental destruction and minimises inequality, is the way forward? Almost before I’ve finished asking the question, he wryly replies that it needs a rebrand – it’s a “terrible name”, he says – but he does think the movement and the people around it are thinking in the “right way”.</p> <p>“We actually have to deal with this now,” he says, adding that we have to do that in a way that is just and protects most people from the worst effects of what is happening. That is what we should all be focused on.</p>",

Bonus fact: Diane’s other son is actor Kerr Logan, best known as Matthew, Robin’s fiance, in Strike, and Matthos Seaworth in Game of Thrones.</p> <p>Might more hidden connections come to light? Don’t rule it out. Remember magician Tom and actor Alex being a secret couple last series? Maybe Zack and the owl are an item.</p> <h2>3 ‘Silence please!’</h2> <p>We love it when La Winkle is mean and masterful. Our host often seems exasperated by roundtable idiocy. She was clearly cheesed off when the brilliant Sonja became the first voted out. “You just banished a really, really smart faithful,” she told the gutted guessers. Her face during Brian’s wobble was also a picture.</p> <p>After disability model Mollie voted to banish Anthony, he smoothly reassured her: “You’re being brave. That’s what this roundtable is for.” Claudia basically told him to shut up and stop interrupting the ballot. Even the edited scene was 20 minutes, so strewth knows how long it took to film. She probably wanted a nap.</p>    <h2>4 Traitors turn on each other</h2> <p>Well, that didn’t take long. During the revote, Paul raised a sly eyebrow at Harry. Both promptly voted to boot out their fellow traitor Ash. Paul coldly reasoned that she’d let the cloaked side down. Only veterinary nurse Miles stayed loyal. If Ash survives by the skin of her teeth, the next nocturnal gathering in the traitors’ turret will be deliciously awkward. Bring it on.</p> <h2>5 Brian’s brainstorm</h2> <p>“What the hell was that reaction?” asked Charlotte, speaking for the nation. Glaswegian photographer Brian was rattled by being voted the most likely to be a “sheep”. The harder he insisted it didn’t bother him, the more it did. By the tense roundtable, the thin-skinned Harry Potter-alike admitted he was “crumbling”.</p> <p>In a show all about maintaining a poker face, gibbering mess Brian wouldn’t have won a game of snap. He just didn’t know when to shush, digging himself into a deepening hole. “Is there anyone else here that is verging towards I am or amn’t?” he blurted nonsensically. “I would like to hear maybe more towards the I amn’t.” Cut to confused faces all round.</p> <p>“Is it nerves or suppressed guilt?” asked ex-soldier Jonny. It was excruciating but somehow relatable to watch him unravel under pressure. Not everyone can be Logan Roy. Someone needs to be Cousin Greg. If it is to be said, so it be, so it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/local_celebrity/status/1743358751736824295\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hamlet: To be or not to be. <br><br>Brian from Traitors: I am or amn’t.</p>&mdash; local_celebrity (@local_celebrity) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/local_celebrity/status/1743358751736824295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <h2>6 Barry the scene-stealing owl</h2> <p>The series began in splendidly camp style, with Claudia writing a scroll by candlelight while chatting to a Hedwig-style messenger owl. The scene-stealing raptor continued to pop up in cutaways, looking wise on the battlements. Claudia joked that its name was Barry, but it’s actually an Indian eagle owl called Sage. He usually gets hired out for weddings to fly up the aisle and deliver the rings. Twit twoo, I do.</p> <h2>7 Your money or your life</h2> <p>The Apprentice-style tasks remain the least interesting element of the show, but adding that immunity shield twist has helped keep this second series unpredictable. Three shields are up for grabs per mission, protecting against murder but not banishment. Zack, Jaz, Andrew and Anthony have already rubbed their fellow faithfuls up the wrong way by nabbing them.</p> <p>Word is, there’s another big twist coming this week. As Claudia said before they entered the castle: “You think you know how this game works. You don’t.”</p> <h2>8 Harry: lip-lickingly good</h2> <p>Army engineer Harry – who admits he has “a face you either want to kiss or punch” – was desperate to be a traitor. He duly got his wish and has proved decent value. An evil Padawan to Darth Paul’s fully fledged Jedi.</p> <p>However, social media erupted with “Ewws!” when Claudia touched blindfolded Harry’s shoulder in the selection meeting and he ostentatiously licked his lips, like Heath Ledger’s Joker meets Hannibal Lecter.

Dapper Aubrey, 67 – proud owner of a cat called Luther Vandross (never too much) – boasted about his astute observation skills once too often and was first to be murdered. Sonja, 66, planned to knit her way to the final but her mischievous humour led to a reputation for stirring the pot and she was banished.</p> <p>This meant the two oldest contestants were culled first. Any accusations of ageism were thankfully avoided by the joint youngest, outspoken 21-year-old apprentice economist Kyra, being murdered next. In this game, age ain’t nothing but a number.</p> <h2>Scores on the castle doors</h2> <p><strong>Best </strong><strong>traitor: </strong>Paul has elected himself leader of the pack, but it’s recruit Miles who’s flying furthest under the radar.</p> <p><strong>Best </strong><strong>faithful:</strong> Early days, but I’m partial to Jasmine and Jonny.

            "body" : "<p>In 2010, Kevin Younger began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/gallery/2010/jul/27/british-character-actors\" title=\"\">an article</a> in the Guardian with the words: “Recognise the faces but can’t place the names?” Among the list of Britain’s top 10 great unsung television character actors that followed was Georgina Hale. “This slinky, adenoidal, estuarine glamour-puss oozed naughtiness in some interesting films and some classic television in the 70s,” he wrote. “She has latterly cornered the market in nouveau riche languor and middle-aged decadence.”</p> <p>Although most of her screen roles were on television, Hale, who has died aged 80, was a favourite of the flamboyant film director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/28/ken-russell\" title=\"\">Ken Russell</a>, who once said she was “an actress of such sensitivity that she can make the hair rise on your arms”.</p> <p>She was at her best for Russell in his fictionalised musical biopic Mahler (1974), portraying the wife of the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler, played by Robert Powell. “It is Georgina Hale’s playing of Alma which gives the film most of its vitality,” observed the Daily Mirror critic Arthur Thirkell.</p> <p>Alma, Mahler’s musically ambitious wife, joins him on a train journey through Austria, which is punctuated by flashbacks to key events in his life. This stifling of her creativity is symbolised in the opening scene, as Gustav dreams of his wife rolling around on rocks, naked and trying to set herself free from the translucent cocoon that surrounds her. Later, he dreams of his death and burial, with Alma leading the funeral procession, then stripping for a Nazi lover.</p>    <p>Hale’s performance was rewarded with a Bafta film award as most promising newcomer. She had previously appeared in Russell’s two 1971 pictures: The Devils, as the pregnant, abandoned conquest of a philandering Roman Catholic priest accused of witchcraft (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/03/features1\" title=\"\">Oliver Reed</a>); and The Boy Friend, as Fay, one of the fictional company singing and dancing alongside Twiggy in the director’s screen version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/27/sandy-wilson\" title=\"\">Sandy Wilson</a>’s stage musical pastiche.</p> <p>She made uncredited cameo appearances in two more Russell films, Lisztomania (1975) and Valentino (1977), and played the young Jim Hawkins’s flirtatious bingo-calling mother in Russell’s bizarre take on Treasure Island, a 1995 TV movie that replaced Long John Silver with Long Jane Silver.</p> <p>In between, Hale was kept busy on television with roles such as the murderer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/ruth-ellis-files-bbc-documentary-murder-case-cant-let-go\" title=\"\">Ruth Ellis</a>, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, in ITV’s series Ladykillers (1980) and Moya Lexington, an amalgam of the pioneering aviator Amy Johnson and the actor Sarah Churchill, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/04/terrence-rattigan-memorial-plays-london\" title=\"\">Terence Rattigan</a>’s play After the Dance (1992) for the BBC. “She’s on the drink, on the drugs and she flies her own aeroplane,” said Hale.</p> <p>She also found a new audience as the witch Tabatha Bag in the later runs of the ITV children’s series T-Bag, beginning with T-Bag and the Pearls of Wisdom (1990) and ending with Take Off With T-Bag (1992). She took over from Elizabeth Estensen, who had played Tabatha’s sister, Tallulah Bag, since the programme’s first episode in 1985.</p> <p>But Hale then saw screen roles begin to dry up. “Once I reached 51, my life changed,” she said in 2002. “Four years ago, I tried to change my agent, and 11 turned me down. One told me they didn’t take actresses over 45 because it was too depressing to talk to them on the telephone.” There was even a two-year spell spent washing dishes in a restaurant, but stage work kept her career going.</p>    <p>She was born in Ilford, Essex, to Elsie (nee Fordham) and George Hole, who ran a pub. She said she grew up overweight and shy, and kept changing school as her parents moved around different pubs – something she believed damaged her education. “I couldn’t write, spell or read,” she told the Glasgow <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12136567.opposites-attract-as-chekhovs-the-cherry-orchard-and-sarah-kanes-blasted-prepare-to-open-at-glasgows-citizens-theatre-this-week-neil-cooper-examines-two-very-different-plays-from-two-very-different-times-still-so-in-love-with-the/\" title=\"\">Herald</a> in 2002. “There was a real shame in it, and you were the dunce of the class, always getting whacked around the head.” </p> <p>Her mother died when she was 18, followed by her father four years later. At the age of 19, having never visited a theatre, she was given tickets to see West Side Story, which, she said, “blew my mind”. </p> <p>She was working in London, as a junior with a Knightsbridge hairdresser, when she spotted an actors’ workshop in Chelsea teaching the Stanislavski technique of method acting. This led her to train at Rada, graduating in 1965. Tweaking her professional name to Hale, she began her career with the Royal Shakespeare Company in walk-on roles at both Stratford-upon-Avon and the Aldwych theatre, London (1965-66).</p> <p>Her West End debut came in The Seagull, by Chekhov, at the Duke of York’s theatre in 1976 as, according to the Stage’s critic, “a tender, thoughtful, charming” Nina. She then starred as Bobbi Michele, alongside Lee Montague, in the British premiere of Neil Simon’s play Last of the Red Hot Lovers at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester (1979), which transferred to the Criterion theatre in London (1979-80).</p> <p>Hale was back in the West End – earning an Olivier award nomination – as Josie in Nell Dunn’s play Steaming (Comedy theatre, 1981-82), set in a Turkish bath. Even though she appeared naked for Russell on film – and was seen wearing nothing but an apron as she cooked breakfast for Roger Daltrey in the 1980 crime movie McVicar – she told the Liverpool Daily Post: “I don’t <em>mind</em> having to take my clothes off. It’s a slice of life, after all. But I don’t really <em>enjoy</em> it.” </p> <p>Her later stage roles included Gwen in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/07/simongray.theatre\" title=\"\">Simon Gray</a>’s black comedy Life Support at the Aldwych theatre in 1997 and Greta Scacchi’s adoptive mother in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2000/oct/13/theatre.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">The Guardsman</a>, by Ferenc Molnar at the Albery, now Noel Coward, theatre, in 2000.</p>    <p>On television, she first made an impression as Adam Faith’s wife, Jean Bird, in Budgie (1971-72), and appeared in drama, comedy and soaps. In the 1972 film Eagle in a Cage, about Napoleon’s imprisonment on St Helena, she played the fallen emperor’s friend Betsy Balcombe.</p> <p>Hale’s 1964 marriage to the actor John Forgeham ended in divorce. She is survived by a nephew, Paul.</p> <p> • Georgina Hale, actor, born 4 August 1943; died 4 January 2024</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 January 2024 to change a picture that did not show Georgina Hale.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Plans to introduce a ban on conversion practices in Scotland should send “a strong message” to LGBTQ+ people that “the Scottish government is still with them”, according to Holyrood’s equalities minister.</p> <p>Emma Roddick was speaking to the Guardian after launching a public consultation on the proposed ban on practices that aim to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.</p> <p>She agreed it amounted to a significant restatement of political intent for a community dispirited by the UK government-imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/20/gender-recognition-reform-bill-scottish-ministers-drop-legal-action-westminster-veto\">block on Holyrood’s gender recognition reform bill</a>, as well as escalating culture war rhetoric around transgender rights.</p> <p>“I’m minister for equalities and I’m also a member of the LGBTQ+ community, so it’s really important to me that we’re working on that relationship,” she said.</p> <p>“I understand why folk might look at current politics and feel a bit lost and like nobody’s sticking up for them and I want them to know that the Scottish government is.”</p> <p>Campaigners are frustrated that the UK government left a similar ban – first promised by Theresa May in 2018 – out of the king’s speech. There is also alarm that the UK equalities minister Kemi Badenoch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/06/gender-affirming-care-for-children-form-of-conversion-therapy-says-badenoch\">suggested last month</a> that gender-affirming care for young people could be considered “a new form of conversion therapy”.</p> <p>Roddick said there was “real unanimity” on the subject in Scotland, with every party including the Scottish Tories committing in their 2021 Holyrood manifestos to at least consult on a ban.</p> <p>YouGov polling for the LGBT+ anti-abuse charity Galop <a href=\"https://galop.org.uk/resource/there-was-nothing-to-fix-lgbt-survivors-experiences-of-conversion-practices/\">published last January</a> revealed that 18% of LGBT+ people in the UK had been subjected to someone trying to change, cure or suppress their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p> <p>The Scottish consultation, which is open until 2 April, was launched alongside an 86-page proposal document that suggests creating a new criminal offence of engaging in conversion practice. It is intended to include scenarios such as therapies that require a person to change their same-sex attraction, or continuing coercive behaviour such as controlling an individual’s activities and appearance.</p> <p>Within minutes of Tuesday’s launch, the Catholic church in Scotland said the “worrying lack of clarity” in the proposals could create a “chilling effect”, while the Christian Institute has already announced it is preparing grounds for legal action.</p> <p>The proposals state that any new offences would not include “non-directive and ethical guidance and support … whether that is provided by a healthcare practitioner, a family member or a religious leader”.</p> <p>The document also distinguishes between the expression of “general statements of belief or opinion” and conversion practices. Proof of intent and the actual causing of physical or psychological harm would be required in order to successfully prosecute.</p> <p>Roddick said she wanted faith groups to consider this “a genuine consultation”, pointing to the draft clauses included in the document as informing stakeholders “what we’re trying to do, what we’re not trying to do and how we want to approach it”.</p> <p>Campaigners believe the Scottish government has learned from the deeply fraught experience of passing the gender recognition reform bill, although the general election makes it pointless to speculate on potential Westminster intervention, as ultimately occurred with the gender bill.</p> <p>The proposals also explicitly exclude the provision of healthcare by a healthcare professional, including “medical treatment intended to align a person’s physical characteristics with their gender identity”, suggested that gender-affirming care would not be included in the ban, counter to Badenoch’s suggestion for the rest of the UK.</p>",

          "fields" : {
            "body" : "<p>Over the past two decades, election results in western Europe have been framed within the narrative of a crisis of the left. Think of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/no-chance-socialist-party-heading-for-implosion-in-french-elections\">near-implosion of the French Socialist party</a> as a case in point. In 2022 the Socialist presidential candidate received less than 2% of the first-round vote, the worst presidential election result in the party’s history.</p> <p>Beyond the ups and downs of specific elections, the performance of social democratic parties has, on average, been marked by a tremendous decline across western European democracies, from a vote share of <a href=\"https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/a-p-b/18074.pdf\">nearly 40% to below 20%</a>.</p> <p>But fixating on the fate of social democratic parties alone is misleading: it overlooks the broader fate of progressive politics that prioritises the core principles of egalitarianism, inclusion and sustainability. While mainstream parties on the left are declining, progressive politics is transforming, renewing and in some instances even thriving.</p> <p>Many of the diagnoses of the left’s challenges rely on assumptions that are at odds with recent research (which we draw on in <a href=\"https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/progressive-politics-research-network/research-briefs/\">six new briefs</a>).</p> <p>One of these flawed claims is the supposed decline of working-class support for the left, which obscures the massive voter gains that progressive parties have made beyond their traditional constituencies. This misinterpretation is rooted in outdated notions about the social composition of progressive party electorates. True, the socioeconomic structure in western Europe today is very different from that which underpinned the golden age of social democracy in the postwar years of the 20th century. The traditional left electorate – industrial workers – has become a minority in most western European democracies, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0268580906061379\">representing 10-20%</a> of the workforce only. However, the decline of the industrial workforce does not signal the demise of progressive politics, for two reasons.</p> <p>The working class has changed: workers in the service sector, particularly in care, personal and recreational services, are today the most disadvantaged. They differ from the industrial working class in that they <a href=\"https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/media/xqueyoh2/ares.pdf\">tend to be younger, female and often have a migration background</a>. Second, voters from the educated middle classes, often employed in services or the public sector, have become the largest and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0958928714556970\">most loyal electorate of progressive parties</a>, whether social democratic, socialist, green or left-libertarian. Progressive parties today engage with a diverse range of voters, from people in precarious or insecure work, women and migrants, to the expanding middle classes. Any analysis that keeps insisting on the declining blue-collar working class as the sole viable electoral constituency of the left underestimates the electoral base of progressive parties overall.</p> <p>To wield political influence, progressive politicians and parties need to consolidate support from beyond the industrial working class. Broadening their electoral base to middle-class voters does not need to weaken the redistributive message. On the contrary, research shows that even the newer segments of the left electorate <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/osf/fehzr\">strongly favour progressive, redistributive economic and social policies</a> – beyond their support for social inclusion and sustainability.</p> <p>Another false assumption that often skews analysis of the crisis of the left is that the middle-class voters induce a rightward shift on such topics as income redistribution and egalitarianism. Such assumptions are often made about professionals supporting green and left-libertarian parties in the progressive bloc. These left voters tend to have higher levels of income and education than average, and, at first glance, seem to prioritise demands for cultural liberalism, liberal migration policy or environmental measures over questions of social justice. However, attracting the support of these voters will not cost progressive parties their redistributive agenda, as middle-class voters are drawn to parties advocating both economic redistribution and socio-cultural inclusion.</p> <p>The belief that these voters prioritise one over the other is not supported by the findings of our <a href=\"https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/go/pprn\">survey research.</a> On welfare state intervention and income redistribution, green voters do not differ from social-democratic voters at all. Both groups are consistently leftwing in their economic considerations. These voters’ commitment to egalitarian redistributive policy is also manifest in their clear opposition to welfare chauvinism. More than two-thirds of social democratic, green or radical left voters <a href=\"https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/media/3dzlcl2k/enggist.pdf\">reject restrictions on migrants’ access to social assistance</a>. Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402382.2019.1702792\">redistributive issues are high on green parties’ agendas</a>. Since the 2010s, in particular, they have emphasised these topics to an even greater extent than social democratic parties.</p> <p>Overall, the left has transformed profoundly since the heyday of social democracy: progressive politics responds to and relies on a society with new social groups, new demands and broadened priorities. While these shifts are irrevocable and it is unlikely that one leftwing party can encompass the entire progressive field of politics, we do not see much reason to project a grim future for progressive policies. The decline of the industrial working class does not mark the end of the left; instead, it requires the formation of new alliances across diverse social groups and political movements that support the progressive agenda.</p> <ul> <li><p>Macarena Ares is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Barcelona.

            "body" : "<p>Sainsbury’s won shoppers from all its major grocery rivals this Christmas but sales at its Argos chain dived, in a worrying sign for high street rivals.</p> <p>The UK’s second-biggest supermarket reported an 8.6% rise in grocery sales in the six weeks to 6 January but Argos sales fell 4.2% in the same period as shoppers reined in spending on electrical goods and furniture.</p> <p>Demand for energy-saving gadgets such as electric blankets and air fryers was down after a surge in 2022 when fears about bills were at a peak, while shoppers bought fewer expensive items such as furniture because of cost of living pressures.</p> <p>Argos sales were strong over the Black Friday discount period in November but weakened in December when it was trading against a strong period a year earlier, when sales were helped by the Royal Mail strikes, which affected home deliveries by online specialists.</p> <p>In another sign of a tough non-food market, Sainsbury’s clothing sales were down 6% in the run-up to Christmas as the company said there had been lots of discounting in the market amid “big chunks” of mild weather.</p> <p>Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, credited the group’s Nectar loyalty scheme discounts and price matching with Aldi on key items, as well as product innovation, with helping the chain take market share from the discounters and all its traditional rivals.</p> <p>Asda lost out the most to Sainsbury’s, followed by Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons, according to data from the market analysts Nielsen.</p> <p>“It was our first purple Christmas,” Roberts said, referring to the colour of its loyalty card. Responding to criticism that the scheme’s discounts, such as Nectar Prices – which Roberts said could save £18 on an £80 shop – were counteracted by charging other shoppers more, he said: “The evidence speaks for itself. Customers really bought into Nectar Prices with 18 million users last year.”</p> <p>Roberts said Sainsbury’s had increased the number of items sold because it had trimmed prices as inflation on food had eased, and claimed Sainsbury’s had increased the number of items sold faster than Aldi for the first time.</p> <p>“We have come a long way on our value position and that is why we have so many more shoppers coming to us,” the chief executive said.</p> <p>He said inflation on food would continue to ease but he did not expect deflation any time soon because – although some commodities had reduced in price – wage inflation would continue to mean higher costs on many items.</p> <p>Roberts said Sainsbury’s was working with the government to help reduce the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade\">problems in the Red Sea</a> caused by attacks by Houthi rebels on cargo ships. He said most shipments via the area were taking at least 10 days longer, as they could not go via the Suez Canal, and Sainsbury’s was carefully planning shipments to try to maintain availability and keep costs down.</p> <p>The company, which before Christmas promised it would hit the top end of market expectations on annual profits, maintained that guidance on Wednesday. However, the poor performance at Argos and lack of an upgrade led to an almost 5% fall in Sainsbury’s share price on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Charlie Huggins at the investment firm Wealth Club, said: <strong>“</strong>Sainsbury’s cannot afford to rest on its laurels. The supermarket sector remains intensely competitive and the UK consumer is far from being out of the woods, with the weaker clothing and general merchandise sales pointing to an element of caution in consumer behaviour.”</p>",

Sometimes you need an editor to tell you that while it’s OK for you to be weirdly obsessed about something, it might be best if you didn’t go down a rabbit hole on the opinion pages of a national newspaper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/08/taylor-swift-nyt-opinion-sexuality\">New York Times faces backlash for essay speculating on Taylor Swift’s sexuality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So I mean this in the nicest possible way when I say that perhaps Anna Marks’s editor at the New York Times should have done her a similar favour. Perhaps someone should have told her that it might not be advisable to write a 5,000-word opinion piece advancing the theory that Taylor Swift – who is currently in a relationship with the NFL player <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-timeline\">Travis Kelce</a> – is secretly a lesbian or bisexual and communicating this fact to the LGBTQ+ community via coded messages in her music. These codes range from the in-your-face (rainbow artwork on albums) to rather more esoteric references to midcentury lesbian magazines in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lhowXIpDAo\">Eras Tour visuals</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, it’s too late for warnings now, isn’t it? The piece (titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/opinion/taylor-swift-queer.html\">Look What We Made Taylor Swift Do</a>) has come out and it’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/jan/08/taylor-swift-nyt-opinion-sexuality\">causing all the backlash</a> and uproar and clicks and conversation that I imagine whoever greenlit it anticipated it would.</p> <p>To be clear: the uproar isn’t because this is the first time in history that someone has suggested that Swift might be gay. On the contrary: theories that the pop star might not be 100% straight have been circulating for years, and there are Reddit forums where people obsess over the idea, scrutinizing every song lyric and social media post for shades of gay. (These Swifties are called “Gaylors”, because of course they are.)</p> <p>Last year there was even a festival, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/postcard-camp-gaylore-cosmopolitan-184300994.html\">Camp Gaylor</a>, dedicated to all things Swiftie and queer. Still, while the theory isn’t new, this is the first time – as far as I can tell – that it has been advanced to such a detailed degree in a serious newspaper.</p> <p>Swift, for her part, has said she isn’t part of the LGBTQ+ community and asked people not to sexualise her female friendships. Was the Times unethical to gloss over all of this and give rumours about her sexuality so much airtime? Swift’s inner circle reportedly thinks so. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/business/taylor-swift-new-york-times/index.html\">CNN</a>, Swift’s <em>associates</em> (a vague term which could mean anyone from Swift’s PR person to someone who once sat in the same restaurant as her) were disgusted by the article, and accused the Times of sexism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Outing someone against their wishes is clearly morally wrong, but that’s very different from overanalysing a bunch of song lyrics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Because of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people’s ethics,” a source told the outlet in response to the Times piece. “This article wouldn’t have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans.”</p> <p>Let’s not go overboard here, eh? Yes, much of the discourse surrounding Swift is steeped in sexism and double standards. But I’m not sure that charge can be levelled at this particular piece. Marks has, after all, written a similar sort of article (albeit much shorter) about Harry Styles – who has been accused of queerbaiting and whose sexuality is constantly being questioned by fans.</p> <p>Further, while I think Marks’s piece was highly inadvisable, I wouldn’t go as far as to say it was unethical. Outing someone against their wishes is clearly morally wrong, but that’s very different from overanalysing a bunch of song lyrics. Particularly when those lyrics are set up to be overanalysed in the first place. As Marks notes in her piece, “Swift <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3YGh73XQU8\">has explicitly encouraged</a> her fans to read into the coded messages (which she calls ‘Easter eggs’) she leaves in music videos, social media posts and interviews with traditional media outlets.”</p> <p>It’s a genius marketing move, encouraging fans to engage deeply with her content and get them speculating about what deeper meaning the megastar might be weaving into her songs. Is it any wonder that some fans go down rabbit holes?</p> <p>Speculating about a celebrity’s sexuality on online forums is one thing, but there’s a case that speculation in serious media outlets is completely different. Certainly, Chely Wright, a queer country singer whose struggles to come out in the early 2000s kicked off Marks’s piece, thinks so. “I think it was awful of [the New York Times] to publish,” she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chelywright/status/1744120916714373230\">wrote</a>. “Triggering for me to read – not because the writer mentioned my nearly ending my life – but seeing a public person’s sexuality being discussed is upsetting.”</p> <p>I can understand why Wright would feel upset about the article, but – and I say this as a gay woman – I take umbrage with the idea that it is upsetting to see a public person’s sexuality being discussed in 2024. I mean, come on now: celebrities have their sexuality discussed all the time. Newsflash: talking about a celebrity dating someone of the opposite sex is <em>discussing a public person’s sexuality</em>.</p> <p>It is unfortunate, I think, that Wright’s criticism accidentally plays into homophobic ideas that only queer people have <em>sexualities </em>while heterosexual love lives are just the default. And quite a lot of the outrage over the Times piece, I should note, does seem to be tinged with homophobia. Certainly all the outraged op-eds in the likes of the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/01/08/entertainment/nyt-should-be-ashamed-of-gross-taylor-swift-op-ed-speculating-shes-a-lesbian/\">New York Post</a> seem disgusted with the very idea that anyone might suspect Swift to be gay. “What’s so wrong about her being a straight white woman who makes great music?”<em> </em>an irate Post article demanded.</p> <p>I’m not entirely sure what Marks set out to achieve with her piece (which, again, was ill-advised), but I do think she has achieved something. She has shown us that the entertainment industry is perfectly fine with its biggest stars flirting with LGBTQ+ imagery. It’s fine with its biggest stars draping themselves in rainbow flags and making statements about allyship. Dare to suggest that those stars might actually be gay, though, and you’ll see quite a lot of old-fashioned homophobia coming out.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Do doctors have an obligation to prevent maiming – or irreversible organ damage, or other kinds of serious bodily harm – and if so, does that obligation extend even to women? Do women have a right to access medically necessary care even if they are pregnant? No, according to the US fifth circuit court.</p> <p>That’s the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.212720/gov.uscourts.ca5.212720.134.1.pdf\">conclusion</a> reached by a three-judge panel recently in Texas v Becerra, a case in which Texas sued the Biden administration over guidance that directed all hospitals receiving federal funds to perform “necessary stabilizing treatment” on patients – including abortions on pregnant patients undergoing medical emergencies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/12/kate-cox-emergency-abortion-texas\">Kate Cox begged Texas to let her end a dangerous pregnancy. She won’t be the last | Moira Donegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The federal guidance, the Biden administration argued, trumped state laws under the supremacy clause. But Texas said that the guidance conflicted with its own total abortion ban, which provides only a vague and effectively inaccessible medical exemption in cases where the life (not merely the health) of the pregnant woman is in danger. The appellate court sided with Texas, freeing the state to force women to the brink of death – if not past it – before they are allowed to access medically necessary abortion treatment. It effectively greenlights the state to enforce injury and illness on women whom it deems insufficiently endangered.</p> <p>The matter is not abstract: those whose pregnancies are causing them serious physical harm are already being forced to endure pain and danger – or to flee their states – due to abortion bans. The fifth circuit ruling comes just weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/12/kate-cox-emergency-abortion-texas\">Kate Cox</a>, a Texas woman with a health-endangering and medically futile pregnancy, was forced to flee the state after the Texas department of justice intervened to prevent her from accessing care.</p> <p>The ruling means that Texas, and other anti-abortion states, have been endowed with a morbid power over the lives and health of pregnant women. They can force them to endure ruptures of the uterus, organ prolapse, massive blood loss and sepsis. They can force them to lose their fertility. And even in cases where – through luck and grace – none of this comes to pass, they can force these women to wait, in fear and humiliation, for what fate has in store for them.</p> <p>Pregnant women in these states can thereby be robbed of their health, of their self-determination, of their dignity and their peace of mind and of quite a lot of money in medical costs – all without recourse or due process to contest the fate that the law has chosen for them. And Republican states can do all this in a sadistic theater of misogynist domination, as a public demonstration of how dearly they supposedly value the lives of fetuses and how cheap they find the lives of women.</p> <p>The legal analyst <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/01/supreme-court-abortion-case-texas-dobbs.html\">Mark Joseph Stern</a>, in a piece for Slate, described the role that the post-Roe courts have been assigned in the wake of Dobbs as one of “death panels”. The judiciary, he says, “holds the power to elevate the potential life of a fetus over the actual life of a patient”.</p> <p>The issue will now be taken up by the US supreme court, which will be tasked with parsing just how much needless suffering states may impose. In the meantime, being pregnant in a conservative state has become a macabre game of chance, with infertility, dismemberment or death always around the corner, waiting to be forced on women by the state should anything go wrong.</p> <p>Over the past few years, it has become popular in the abortion-rights movement to refer to abortion as healthcare. And this is true, in the broadest sense: all abortions are medical interventions meant to preserve and enhance quality of life. But relying too much on this framing risks obscuring just how far we have gone down the anti-abortion road in the year and a half since Dobbs. Because abortion, of course, is not only healthcare: it is a means by which women and others capable of becoming pregnant, enact their intrinsic human right to shape their own lives, control their own bodily functions, dictate their own priorities and live their own values.</p> <p>Abortion is not always necessary to protect a patient’s health, or preserve her bare life: sometimes, it is necessary to allow her to do the things that make her life worth living. But this is not how the anti-abortion side sees it, and it is not the issue being debated in Texas v Becerra: the issue there is not about whether women can determine the course of their own lives, but about whether the state of being pregnant means that a woman forfeits her claim on any life at all.</p> <p>Who, exactly, is endowed with what the anti-abortion movement has for so long called the “right to life”? Who, exactly, is thought to have unalienable claims to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Not women, at least not in the anti-abortion worldview that now carries the force of law in places like Texas. The vision of the law being advanced in Texas v Becerra is one in which medical providers may not intervene to save a woman’s life, may not presume that that life has value and may not treat that life as having dignity – it is one in which they are forced to make her endure unnecessary pain, unnecessary indignity and unnecessary risk, while her life hangs in the balance.</p> <p>We are accustomed to considering abortion bans as compelling <em>in</em>action – as stopping a planned intervention and forcing the maintenance of the status quo; that is, of the pregnancy. But this version of an abortion ban, one that places a wall between a woman in a medical emergency and the care that would save her health, cannot be considered passive. The refusal to provide an abortion in these emergency circumstances is a distinctly active choice, one that will, sooner or later, result in a patient’s death.</p> <p>Any realistic assessment of the fifth circuit’s opinion compels us to see that Texas’s choice is a homicidal one. The anti-abortion movement does not appear to see the irony: it is still us, the feminists, whom they call “murderers”.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Particular favourites were the voice-activated bidet (I have always believed in water over wiping – better yet, both – and have a theory that we are being brainwashed by “big tissue”); a pillow that adjusts the sleeper if they snore; and a robot mop-vacuum hybrid that claims to seek out stains.</p> <p>I will admit that there is something of the last days of Rome about CES. Here it is, the culmination of efforts from some of the greatest tech minds of our generation, solving problems that were … not really problems to begin with. Like this year’s much-lauded reveal of the see-through TV. That’s right, it looks like glass when it’s off, finally addressing the issue of a television looking like a television.</p> <p>Such upgrades are usually just marketing ploys – new ways to sell old things. But I have nearly been had. A few years ago, I sat through a demonstration of a washing machine I couldn’t afford because of its “cutting-edge” gymwear setting.

For starters Boyle’s throw is a yard shy of the endzone coming to a stop in the arms of Holland. It gets worse as the safety shifts across the turf, around two would-be tacklers in Miami’s half. At midfield the killer blow is dealt. Holland sticks his foot in the turf, going inside two defenders after Bradley Chubb and Christian Wilkins’ exquisite tandem blocks.

Fortunately Higgins is a part-time contortionist: he starts to fall out of bounds, palming the ball into his right hand while whipping it backwards to brush its tip over the pylon for the score.

All you learn is that there’s a way of looking at the world that doesn’t belong to you,” says&nbsp;twentysomething protagonist Sofie Lakmaker, who shares a surname and major biographical details with her author. She is recalling a trip around Europe she made at 18, with the possibility of danger at every corner: “At every hostel I stayed in I&nbsp;made sure to get a top bunk just so I&nbsp;could keep a lookout.” There’s the abjection that comes with having less power. “There were a lot of men who tried to kiss me on that trip. It was nuts.” As for the prospect of finding deliverance? Forget it. “You can race around the world searching for meaning and look for words that capture that meaning. But you won’t find anything.”</p> <p>For Sofie, such passivity is a constant feature of being alive. Growing up in the well-heeled Oud-Zuid district of Amsterdam, things seem to happen <em>to&nbsp;</em>her, rather than <em>by </em>her. She is an aspiring writer who wishes to be one of “the Greats”, but one problem with trying to be a genius <em>as a girl</em>, she discovers, is that people spend a lot of time telling you how much nicer you would look if you grew your hair long.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The self-aware millennial sex novel has become a mini-industry within the publishing world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The History of My Sexuality, translated from Dutch by Kristen Gehrman, charts Sofie’s coming of age. Divided into three parts, the novel regales with funny and affecting intimacy tales of failed relationships, failed academic pursuits, and friendships that sputter to a halt. The first part describes how Sofie was “first into men, and later into women, but really always into women”, with each chapter devoted to an ex. There is Walter, a conservative (“I tried to focus on that, to channel the weird connection between horniness and hate”); Jennifer, an actor; and Kyra, an art director who cries during sex. The second part recalls Sofie’s life studying philosophy, with pithy summaries of Theodor Adorno, Simone de Beauvoir and Ludwig Wittgenstein, though the narrative keeps “straying from the intellectual to the sexual. In that sense, I’m a lot more like Sigmund Freud than I thought.”</p> <p>The self-aware millennial sex novel has become a mini-industry within the publishing world. Many features of this type of narrative are found in The History of My Sexuality. There is a protagonist who is established as clever (“the teacher kept telling me that I should sign up for the honours programme”) but holds the world at a&nbsp;gently disgusted distance (“the honours programme is for students with an inferiority complex”). Sex is void of pleasure and relationships a story of self-sabotage. The writerly voice is wry and detached, full of excoriating observations about others.</p> <p>In a genre that renders the external world and other people distant and patchy against an anxious internal psyche, a reader may find themselves wondering what is really at stake besides the ego: what lies behind the barrier of shame. When the usually assured voice of the novel falters – a&nbsp;section on Sofie’s time learning Russian meanders – there is a feeling of being in a standup comedy set. You wonder where it is all heading. What distinguishes the book is the boldness of Sofie’s voice, as when she recalls run-ins with real-life Amsterdam celebrities, some of them howlingly rude. There is also a sweetness in the way Lakmaker describes human folly, how people can be gently ridiculous. Take Bennie, a former colleague who is prone to whispering “God, I really want to have a threesome”. “Usually men say that when they want to have a&nbsp;threesome with you, but Bennie wasn’t like that,” Sofie recalls. “He’d always follow up with, ‘but I’m just not ready yet, Sof, I’m not ready yet.’”</p> <p>The final section discusses a death that has been hanging over “this <em>entire </em>story” like an “artificial mosquito buzzing sound”. There is no grand lesson to be discovered in loss; just the wreckage, the questions, and not knowing “how sad I actually am”. While concluding “there’s so little I know for sure”, Sofie does feel more sure of a desire to “make an appointment at the VU Medical Centre, where you can become less of a girl and more of a boy. That’s how I like to put it, you know? <em>More </em>boy.” This is mentioned lightly, cutting against the heavy scrutiny common in gender identity conversations today, and that is the point. In an era that demands people trade in absolutes – affirm exactly who they are, what they feel and believe, while shoring up the boundaries of what a person can be – the phrase “less girl, more boy” is fitting for a novel that depicts life as a process of change, questioning and discovery; and by doing so, touches on something closer to the truth.</p> <p>• The History of My Sexuality by Tobi Lakmaker, translated by Kristen Gehrman, is published by Granta (£14.99).

Some people even hate their phones, but still struggle to reduce use. In 2021, US adults spent on average eight hours with digital media each day. A growing body of evidence shows that the more time a person spends consuming digital media each day, the more likely they are to struggle with depression and anxiety. We see clinically that when depressed and anxious patients spend less time online, mood and anxiety improve without our having done any other intervention.</p> \n<p><strong>Gloria Mark:</strong> Yes. We know empirically that people’s attention spans have shortened over the last 20 years. We also know anecdotally, from what people report, that they’re more distracted.</p> \n<p><strong>Amy Orben:</strong> It’s a very human trait to worry about new technologies: people were concerned about the printing press corrupting society. So that’s a major part of it. But also the technologies are different now, they’re more personalized. I think the concern about phones as a singular entity are overblown. Phones are tools. And like all other technologies, their impact really depends on who uses them and how. There are valuable concerns about specific types of phone use, and specific ways technologies are designed that I think we should discuss as a society.</p> \n<p><strong>Laurence Steinberg:</strong> I think people worry when they feel they can’t control their use, especially if they’ve tried to stop or cut back and failed, or if they believe their use is interfering with other aspects of life.</p> \n<p><strong>Zoetanya Sujon:</strong> Every new technology, when it comes out – from the landline phone to the television – brings to the surface concerns about what is real, what is mediated, what is performative? In that sense, people are right to be concerned, because they have lots of uncertainty ahead. The smartphone is also one of the most intimate technologies. It’s in our pockets. We put it on our faces, it’s close to our bodies. It also has such a wide nexus of uses – work, social, private, very private. When someone’s looking at their phone, you don’t know what they’re doing. But there are also a lot of things that are very pro-social, beneficial and positive. So yes, people are right to worry, but they’re also right to think about things that are more positive.</p> \n<h2><strong>How does smartphone use affect children and teens differently than adults?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lembke:</strong> Children’s brains are going through a rapid process of development where the circuits they use least are pruned [cut back] and the circuits they use most often made more efficient through a process called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelinogenesis\">myelination</a>. Hence, childhood and adolescence is a critical time of building neural circuits that will provide the scaffolding for the adult brain.</p> \n<p>If children are spending all their time online, they will have a complex and elaborated neural scaffolding for that but not for other important activities, like learning delayed gratification, frustration tolerance, in-person socialization, mind-body connection, etc. Also, adolescents are exquisitely sensitive to social cues and so are more likely to be influenced by the social contagion effect of the internet.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Children have developing minds, and there’s a part of the mind that’s called executive function, and this doesn’t really mature until children become teenagers. It’s a really important part of the brain because it helps us filter out distractions. But for kids, this part of the brain isn’t developed completely, so they don’t have as great an ability to control distractions as people who are older.</p> \n<p>Kids also develop habitual behaviors. With using their phones, once they have these habits developed, they’re really hard to break. If, instead of spending their time playing outside with other kids, they develop a habit of spending time on your phone, they lose a proprioceptive sense of behavior – an understanding of their body moving through space. It’s important for kids to get outside, run around, play and develop coordination, but being on their phones and computers doesn’t give them the chance to develop that.</p> \n<p><strong>Orben:</strong> A key part of these “moral panics” [surrounding new technologies] is that, historically, they’re often about people who are not power holders in society. Largely women and kids. But I do think there are reasons why we might be more concerned about young people. They are the canaries in the coalmine. They use technologies early, and they often adopt them the fastest. So by studying them, we might be able to predict what will happen in other groups. They’re also in a period of development where their brains are still developing their social skills. And if you’re a teenager, that’s an inherently social time where you really care about what other people think, and where the social parts of the online world can have a heightened impact.</p> \n<p><strong>Steinberg:</strong> The literature on teenagers is inconclusive, and few studies have the ability to determine causality. Some studies find very small correlations between social media use and mental health problems, but most research can’t distinguish between cause and effect, and there are studies that show that kids who are depressed tend to use social media more than non-depressed kids, so that depression is “causing” the social media use, rather than the reverse. Very few studies have adequate controls for confounding variables.</p> \n<p><strong>Sujon:</strong> There’s huge debate here. There’s probably as much evidence about the harmful effects of media, including smartphones, as there is about the positive effects. One of the big concerns is that children are still developing, and have less capacity to navigate things like advertising, and the wild and startling worlds that phones give access to.</p> \n<h2><strong>What do we know about how phones affect our day-to-day social interactions?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lembke:</strong> Social media invites comparisons between ourselves and other people, leaving many of us feeling that we can never measure up to the illusory standards of achievement, beauty or happiness that are portrayed online. This is turn can contribute to learned helplessness, depression and anxiety. The AI algorithms that track us push to more extreme content which can contribute to polarization and consumption of more extreme content, neither of which is good for fostering civil discourse or for emotional and mental wellbeing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Social media can maintain relationships, but it’s not going to enable people to develop meaningful, deep relationship</p> \n  <footer> <cite>Dr Gloria Mark</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> It’s decreasing the amount of social interaction people have with each other. People, in my view, are losing the ability to develop deep relationships with other people, because where is their attention? It’s on social media. And social media can maintain relationships, but it’s not going to enable people to develop meaningful, deep relationships.</p> \n<p><strong>Orben:</strong> We shouldn’t be surprised that many things can have both a positive and a negative impact. For example, a group that people are very interested in is LGBTQ+ teenagers, because they often say that being online is a crucial part of their wellbeing because it allows them to connect with similar people and explore their identity. But they’re also a group that are much more bullied online and can have much more negative experiences. It’s a complex space, and we need to acknowledge that. </p> \n<p><strong>Steinberg:</strong> With respect to teenagers, the research suggests that if teens use social media mainly to stay in touch with friends whom they also see face to face on a regular basis, it isn’t problematic. But when using phones replaces face-to-face interaction, it can be. So it’s the absence of face-to-face interaction, not the presence of phone use, that’s the problem.</p> \n<p><strong>Sujon:</strong> It’s very contradictory. You get things in the media like “phubbing”, when people are snubbing [ignoring] other people to be on their phones. But there are ways in which it’s pro-social. People can create beautiful things with photos, film and videos. YouTube, for example, is one of the important streaming services where people can be creative and find community. That’s really powerful. I would say that phones are absolutely not a luxury. If you don’t have one, you’re excluded from many important social, professional and everyday institutions. If you need to make a hospital appointment on a mobile website, you will be physically at risk if you can’t do that.</p> \n<h2><strong>Should smartphone use be more regulated?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lembke:</strong> Yes. This is a communal problem. All branches of societies, from individuals to families to schools to corporations to governments, need to come together to help solve this problem, especially when it comes to exposing children to harmful use. Schools should top-down ban smartphones from schools, not just the classroom but from use at any point during school hours so that kids will be freer to learn and to socialize. If there are safety concerns, the child can have a dumb phone that has calling capacity for emergencies. We need to build an infrastructure inside of medicine to help those who become addicted to the internet, from pornography to sports betting to video games to social media.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I am a big proponent of Right to Disconnect laws. <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/08/telework-and-the-french-right-to-disconnect/\">France has one</a>, Ontario, Canada, has a policy, and Ireland has a policy. I will say, there was a study done in France to look at how well the law worked, and they found it to be a mixed bag. Employees liked it, but the employers didn’t. So, employers didn’t always follow it, and it wasn’t necessarily enforced. That tells me there really needs to be a cultural change along with policies and laws.</p> \n<p><strong>Orben:</strong> When we design public infrastructure, we consider the design, and we have regulations in place and decision-making processes that are inherently public. The issue with technology is that we’re dealing with private – but kind of public – infrastructure, where those decisions are made behind closed doors by people who have different motivations, including profit. Just because I acknowledge the complexities of impact doesn’t mean that I don’t believe we should do better in ensuring that our public infrastructure around how we interact online is safe, environmentally appropriate.</p> \n<p><strong>Steinberg:</strong> I think parents should regulate their kids’ use. I don’t think the evidence is strong enough or conclusive enough to warrant government intervention, though. I also think that social media companies should provide guidance and advice for parents and teenagers on healthy versus unhealthy use.</p> \n<p><strong>Sujon:</strong> This is tricky. You look at schools and even some universities saying ‘no phones’, and I think, in the environment we live in, that’s a little bit dangerous. If someone needs to talk to a family member, and they can’t, or they’ll be punished, I don’t think that’s necessarily healthy. Where we need regulation is around content providers and streaming services. Between YouTube’s recommendation systems, which often feed negative content to keep people there and in this state of excitement, and things like TikTok, it’s really difficult to regulate content that’s age-appropriate for kids, teens and adults. Those platforms need to be more regulated, and that will have an impact on how and where smartphones are used, because they are conduits towards those systems.</p> \n<h2><strong>How do we get people to step back from their smartphones when it can feel like one’s entire life – social, professional, personal – is on there?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lembke:</strong> It’s very hard. Encourage teens to come together in friendship circles and together take a break from their phones for four weeks. Doing it together makes it easier: less Fomo, more support. Many people who take a break from their phones for that period of time feel so much better, they are determined to use them differently, and less. By making a detailed plan of what that will look like, they often succeed.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> There are things that individuals can do, but managers and organizations really need to step up and play a role. We need to see a change in culture. Managers need to communicate to teams that it’s not permissible to send electronic communications after work hours. There needs to be a collective solution.</p> \n<p><strong>Orben:</strong> The addiction metaphor is often quite difficult to work with, because our phones aren’t like heroin. We have to use them. And they don’t have that severe brain impact. Phones are more like food. We all need to eat, but the way our food system is set up isn’t great. It has ways in which it’s designed and shaped by corporations, and even though we’re all experiencing the same ecosystem, different people experience it in different ways. Similarly with phones, it’s about our motivations, and it’s about reflection and what works for us and what doesn’t.</p> \n<p><strong>Steinberg:</strong> It’s very hard because the devices serve multiple purposes. One suggestion many experts make is to not use these devices after one retires for the evening or when having meals with others. But I think that to be effective, parents need to do this as well as teens.</p> \n<p><strong>Sujon:</strong> It’s a complicated question, because it’s not just about smartphone use, it’s about what are you doing in your life and where your focus is. It’s about stepping back and making sure that there’s a balance across the needs you have in your life, whether those are social, creative or professional. Also, these technologies are designed to be sticky. So [overuse] is not just a personal failing, it’s not because you, or I, or our children, are incapable of regulating ourselves. They’re designed to pull us in.</p> \n<p><strong>Twenge:</strong> Groups have to get together to change the norms. That’s already happened to an extent. People recognize that 24/7 accessibility is not a good way to live.Gen Z fully recognizes mental health and wellness, and are at the forefront of that issue, and I think this is one of the things we’re going to start hearing more about.</p> \n<h2><strong>How would you describe your own relationship to your phone?</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p> In 2021, US adults spent on average eight hours with digital media each day</p> \n  <footer> <cite>Anna Lembke</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Lembke:</strong> I didn’t have a smartphone until about five years ago when I was required by the hospital to get one in order to prescribe medications. I was one of the only people I knew not to have a phone. In the first two decades or so of this century, I didn’t build my life around my phone, so today, I remain independent of it. I carry it with me for work, but it is turned off in my bag most of the time. I don’t give out the number. I use it when I travel for rideshare. That’s about it.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> I don’t use my smartphone as much as other people. I have a colleague who’s younger than I am, and I told him that when I walk into another room, I don’t carry my phone with me. And he was shocked. I use my phone when I go running every day, and I use my phone to listen to audiobooks. </p> \n<p><strong>Orben:</strong> It’s a core part of my life. I went into this research area because I was part of the first generation to use social media. In my school years, it shaped me like any other part of my life did. It’s been crucial to my career. It’s also been stressful and harmful in other ways. I have mixed emotions. I think something needs to change, but also I wouldn’t want to go back to a life where I can’t FaceTime my grandma.</p> \n<p><strong>Steinberg:</strong> I’ve stopped using social media (I used Twitter when I was promoting a book, but that was the only use, and I’ve stopped because it wasn’t effective). I use it mainly to do email for work and the occasional text with family members. But because so much of my work is done through these media, I spend a lot of time using my phone. I will admit that my email use has become compulsive at times, mainly because I love the feeling of having an empty inbox and I don’t want to miss any email from the Nobel committee.</p> \n<p><strong>Sujon:</strong> I am absolutely one of those people who probably overuses it. I use it for work. I joke with my kids that I’m the mamarazzi – it’s my job to take pictures and document family life. I enjoy that. I don’t share very much information on social media. So I use my phone quite intensively, but I keep that separate from my public profiles. I also put measures in place where I try to take small, regular breaks, as well as during family time and social interactions.</p> \n<h2><strong>What do you think the most important thing is that people need to understand about smartphones?</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Lembke:</strong> Smartphones are powerful tools and potent drugs. Using them as a tool is smart. As a drug, not so much.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> That it’s not a replacement for human, in-person contact.</p> \n<p><strong>Orben:</strong> They’re not a monolith. They are very complex technologies that combine a lot of different activities, a lot of different apps and designs. And if we talk about it as one thing, we’re inherently going to get it wrong.</p> \n<p><strong>Steinberg:</strong> They are tools, and they can be put to good use and bad use. I also think that what we are seeing is a pretty familiar story: whenever kids start using a new technology or form of entertainment, adults point the finger at it as the root of all things evil. It happened with dime-store novels, radio, comic books, television, rock’n’ roll, hip-hop, the internet, and so forth. Each time, critics of the technology or medium would say “this time is different”. And each time, it turned out that people were worrying with little cause for concern. So stay tuned.</p> \n<p><strong>Sujon:</strong> Smartphones are part of a much greater media ecosystem. They’re the interface to that media system, so it’s hard to separate the two. Being aware of that is really important.</p> \n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/14/sign-up-to-reclaim-your-brain-our-free-email-to-help-you-scroll-less-and-live-more\">Sign up to our free coaching newsletter to help you spend less time on your phone</a></p>",

Warner made his Test debut in December 2011 by which time (the now 41-year-old) Jimmy Anderson was already into his third or fourth iteration of international fast bowler, a coiled-spring colossus who had dominated the Australian summer before Warner’s arrival, pocketing 24 wickets and leading England towards their first Ashes series win in Australia in 24 years … <em>or</em> five-eighths of a (current) “Jimmy”.</p> <p>For Warner, a few years of lucrative Twenty20 franchise tournaments await, a cash-injected climbdown into full retirement some day in the not too distant future. For Anderson it is a case of more lonesome loops of the running track in an attempt to leave his body behind, or keep it at bay a bit longer, at least. More indoor sessions bowling at a stump as singular as his mindset, tinkering, tightening, Benjamin Button-ing his frame with the addition of multivitamins and boyish haircuts. For Anderson, India lies in wait. Five Tests in only seven weeks.</p> <p>India is no place for a medium-pace swing bowler, not really, especially not a 41-year-old one. The heat and the bone-grinding nature of the pitches are enough to strike fear into the guts of the most battle-hardened quick, even those who can rely on searing pace to exploit and unsettle. And yet Anderson defies logic, curls a collagen lip at it and carries on regardless. Take his last visit to India, in 2021, when on the verge of turning 40, he took eight wickets at an impressively parsimonious average of 15.87, holding the line like a gnarled sentinel in the three Tests he played. Yet even Anderson at his most miserly couldn’t prevent England’s 3-1 series defeat.</p> <p>During England’s landmark series win in India in 2012, Anderson was 30 and played all four Tests under the captain, Alastair Cook. His wickets column and average were higher (12 wickets at 30.25) but the seamer used all his accumulated wiles to jag and cut the ball off the Indian clay, ably supporting the spin of Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, to secure England’s first Test series win in India since 1984-85 (or 28 years; seven-tenths of a Jimmy).</p>    <p>In 13 Tests in India Anderson has an exemplary record, taking 34 wickets at 29.32, only three runs higher than his overall average across 183 Tests. Despite this, he heads to the subcontinent under something of a cloud, not gunmetal in hue as of yet but pointedly urn-shaped.</p> <p>During the Ashes series last summer Anderson cut an increasingly subdued figure, the seamer going as far as to describe the English pitches as “like kryptonite” while Mark Wood, Chris Woakes and most notably his bandana-clad comrade-in-arms over the past decade, Stuart Broad, did the business and prevented Australia from winning the series outright. Broad swapped the bails and bent the narrative towards a rousing and remarkable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/02/stuart-broad-careers-ending-david-beckham-retirement\">send-off at the Oval</a> but Anderson dismissed any talk of his own retirement, saying Broad’s decision to call it a day spurred him on to keep going, despite a chastening summer. A return of five wickets in four Tests and – perhaps more pertinent – a summer-long inability to garner any meaningful movement on the same English pitches that have served him so well for nearly two decades.</p> <p>Anderson rankles when asked about “the R-word” and is clearly putting the hard yards in, as he always has, for another stint in England’s attack. He’s also on record saying he would like to decide when the time is right to go, and plenty will say he has earned at least that. But sport doesn’t really work that way; its central tenets are spontaneity and unpredictability. You risk being burnt if you start to think it owes you something, even if, like Anderson, you have given it nearly everything you have.</p> <p>In his desire to continue playing Test cricket Anderson, despite his longevity and unparalleled service, has put himself at the mercy of the selectors with a bruising Test series in India imminent. Broad and Warner have recently had their day in the sun, Cook and plenty more before them, too. Anderson, for the time being, is marching on, leaving his body behind yet moving forward once again, head bowed against the gathering clouds.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>His off-colour jokes, provocative streak and relative lack of political experience make Ko Wen-je the wildcard choice for this weekend’s closely watched presidential elections in Taiwan. But with an impressive turnout at recent rallies and a huge following on social media, there are signs that the outsider may have been underestimated.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/taiwan-election-who-candidates-what-stake\">The vote</a> on Saturday, in which 19 million Taiwanese will choose their next president, is one of the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-taiwans-elections-applaud-democracy-in-action\">closely contested races</a> since the self-governing island first held elections in 1996. Legislative elections, which are looking just as uncertain, will be held on the same day.</p> <p>The frontrunners for the presidency are the Democratic Progressive party’s (DPP) Lai Ching-te and the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Hou You-yi. But the campaign has been disrupted by Ko and his Taiwan People’s party (TPP), which he founded in 2019.</p> <p>Known as “Ko P” or “Professor Ko” to his supporters, Ko, a former surgeon, has built a huge following online. On Instagram, he has 1.1 million followers. The DPP’s Lai has 171,000 while the KMT’s Hou has just over 97,000. Only the outgoing president, Tsai Ing-wen, comes close to matching Ko’s online popularity, with 979,000 Instagram followers. It is a similar story on YouTube, where Ko has more than 1 million subscribers, compared with Tsai’s 466,000. While the DPP frames the vote as a choice between “democracy and autocracy”, and the KMT says it is a matter of “war or peace”, Ko says that the election is a competition between “new politics and old forces”.</p> <p>Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said that, given the “fairly fluid situation” in Taiwan, Ko could be a significant force in the election.</p> <p>Depending on who is asked, Ko is a flexible pragmatist or a superficial populist who lacks core values. He positions himself as a “third way” technocrat between the DPP and the KMT. Although he entered politics in 2014 as an independent backed by the DPP, and had supported the Sunflower movement, which protested against a trade deal with China, as mayor of Taipei between 2014 and 2022 he pursued closer economic ties.</p> <p>But the particulars of his policies seem to be less important than the fact that to many voters, particularly younger people, he feels like a breath of fresh air. Although the more socially conservative KMT is associated with Taiwan’s elite, the more progressive DPP, having been in power for eight years, is also seen by some as being the establishment, rather than a force for change. A quarter of voters are under 40, so Ko’s younger base could be influential.</p> <p>We have “taken people by surprise”, said Cynthia Wu, a businesswoman turned legislator who is running to be Ko’s vice-president. She said part of his appeal was that “he is not so fussed [about] ideological rhetoric”.</p> <p>Matt, a 21-year-old computer science student in the southern city of Chiayi, is using his first ever vote to support Ko. Ko “cares more about younger people, so we prefer to give him a chance to be the president”, Matt said, citing Ko’s housing policies.</p> <p>Although a Taiwanese factchecking centre recently <a href=\"https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/10107\">rebuked</a> Ko for claiming to have built “most of” the 21,528 social housing rental units available in Taipei as of August 2023, as mayor of the capital he did oversee the building of more than 6,300 social housing units.</p> <p>“I want to give this third party a try,” said Matt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/taiwan-election-who-candidates-what-stake\">Taiwan election: who are the candidates and what is at stake?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many other voters are TPP-curious. On Sunday, the party estimated that 60,000 people turned out at Ko’s rally in Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second city, in the south. Although the party’s estimate may be overblown, the pictures of hordes of crowds spilling through the streets surprised analysts.</p>    <p>Ko’s traditional support base is in the north, from his time as a popular independent mayor of Taipei for eight years. “But he has shown in recent days his ability to mobilise in the south,” said Yang. “That could be an indication that he could be a more significant player rather than just flaming out.”</p> <p>His popularity comes despite his frequent gaffes. In October, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/taiwan-election-who-candidates-what-stake\">likened</a> cross-strait relations to prostate cancer in a metaphor about the need to co-exist with one’s enemies. He has been criticised for several misogynistic comments during his time in politics, including in 2018 when he said that Taiwanese women who left the house without wearing makeup would scare people. Such comments showed that he was “authentic”, said Wu. “He is willing to admit his mistakes.”</p> <p>Ko is unlikely to beat Lai or Hou to the presidency. But TPP seats in the legislature could tip the balance of power in any potential coalition. And the oxygen that the raucous campaign has given to his brand is clear. “He will come out of the election with his influence strengthened,” Yang said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Additional research by Chi Hui Lin</em></p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>The right to wild camp on Dartmoor could be under threat again after the supreme court granted permission for a wealthy landowner to bring a case against it.</p> <p>Last year, the Dartmoor National Park Authority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/wild-camping-dartmoor-court-appeal\">won an appeal against a decision to ban wild camping</a> on the moors.</p> <p>Camping had been assumed to be allowed under the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1985/37/contents/enacted\">Dartmoor Commons Act</a> since 1985, until a judge ruled otherwise last January. It was the only place in England that such an activity was allowed without requiring permission from a landowner.</p> <p>The case hinged on whether wild camping counted as open-air recreation, leading to a long debate in the court of appeal. Lawyers acting for Alexander Darwall, the landowner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/18/camping-not-recreation-because-you-are-just-asleep-dartmoor-appeal-told\">argued it was not, because when camping one was only sleeping</a> rather than enjoying a particular activity.</p> <p>After the court of appeal decision, lawyers acting for Darwall, a hedge funder and Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, asked the supreme court to hear the case.</p> <p>Darwall bought the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor in 2013. He offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.</p> <p>His attempts to ban wild campers from using his estate without his permission sparked a large protest movement, with thousands going to Dartmoor to assert their right to camp. It awakened a land rights debate in the UK, with the Labour party weighing in. The party previously said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/04/labour-would-extend-right-to-wild-camp-to-all-english-national-parks\">legislate for a right to wild camp</a> in all national parks. However, it since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/25/labour-u-turns-on-promise-of-scottish-style-right-to-roam-in-england\">appears to have U-turned on its land rights policy</a>.</p> <p>Lewis Winks, from the Stars Are For Everyone campaign, said: “The loss of our cherished right to sleep under the stars on Dartmoor ignited a passionate and broad movement for greater land rights in England. This news is confirmation that reform is both needed and inevitable, and will act as a clarion call to all those who wish for generations to come to enjoy these fundamental freedoms.</p> <p>“As ever, the right to wild camp is emblematic of the fragility of our wider rights in the English countryside, and Darwall’s latest egregious move illustrates the need for greater legal protections for access to nature.</p> <p>“We hope that the court sees sense and returns a favourable verdict, enabling wild camping to continue on the commons of Dartmoor.”</p> <p>Darwall’s legal team at Landmark Chambers said that the high court held that the words in the act “unambiguously <em>excluded</em> a right to camp on Dartmoor” and found in favour of the landowners. The court of appeal held that it “unambiguously <em>included </em>a right to camp” and allowed the Dartmoor National Park Authority’s appeal. “The appeal to the supreme court will determine once and for all this important issue, namely whether members of the public enjoy a right to camp on the Dartmoor commons,” it said.</p> <p>“The supreme court will be asked to consider a number of principles applicable to statutory interpretation which will be of interest to practitioners. In particular, it will be invited to consider whether the court of appeal took sufficient account of admissible ‘background’ materials (i) in identifying the ‘mischief’ at which the legislation was aimed and (ii) in considering whether the statutory language was ambiguous.”</p>",

Carlo Ciampi, his Italian counterpart, was even more fulsome. “It may seem utopian, but here we are, and today I feel I am a European who was born in Italy. Money, the manifestation and token of sovereignty, is no longer national but European.” Fine words, but then “project Europe” has never lacked noble apologists to follow in the footsteps of Jean Monnet, the French technocrat and one-time cognac salesman who dreamed up the 1950 Schuman plan which created the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor to the European Union.</p> <p>For most, however, the reality falls somewhat short of Mr Ciampi’s utopia.

Promotional materials describe it as “an origin story, signalling a wider cinematic universe which will centre on our anti-hero character, Tribal Mark, and his role within the undercover Black Secret Service – with more to be revealed later this year”. The film features a 90% global majority cast and crew.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The R&amp;A has surprisingly announced Martin Slumbers is to leave his role as the chief executive. Slumbers, 63, has been in position since succeeding Peter Dawson in 2015. He will depart golf’s ruling body by the end of this year, with a recruitment team already having been appointed to find a new chief executive.</p> <p>Sources at the organisation insist Slumbers always intended to stay in post for between five and 10 years but there had been no indication the Englishmanhe was about to depart St Andrews. Slumbers will exit with his sport still trying to plot a path towards a successful future involving existing tours and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p> <p>Slumbers said: “It has been a privilege to serve golf at the highest level. It is a role that I have been proud to carry out on behalf of the R&amp;A’s employees, the members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club and all our global partners. In any career, there is a time to allow the next generation to have its turn. I am grateful to have had the honour, for nearly a decade, to have been the custodian of all that the R&amp;A and the game of golf more broadly represents.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/08/tiger-woods-and-nike-bring-500m-27-year-partnership-to-an-end\">Tiger Woods and Nike bring $500m, 27-year partnership to an end</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The R&amp;A broke with their own tradition by turning to Slumbers, a fine amateur player who had a career background in banking rather than golf administration or the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club. The R&amp;A’s chief executive also serves as the secretary of the golf club. </p> <p>Key successes during his tenure include the sharp growth of both the Open Championship and Women’s British Open in commercial terms. Slumbers has also been at the forefront of plans to limit driving distances for elite players, with new regulations aimed at “rolling back” the golf ball due to come into operation later this decade. Slumbers has made sustainability, both of golf courses and the sport in financial terms, a theme of his time in office. He has been a highly popular figure within the R&amp;A, where he is viewed as an innovator.</p> <p>Recently, Slumbers’ willingness to court Saudi Arabia has raised eyebrows. At last summer’s Open Championship, he refused to rule out commercial partnerships between the R&amp;A and the Saudis. He later held a series of meetings with Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of the PIF, with the duo playing partners during the autumn’s Dunhill Links Championship. The R&amp;A later confirmed it is in talks over supporting “development projects” in the kingdom. Saudi’s march into golf, primarily through the LIV tour, has proved hugely controversial. With alliances between the R&amp;A and the Saudis strengthening all the time, the new chief executive will have to pick up the baton.</p> <p>Niall Farquharson, chairman of the R&amp;A, said: “In Martin, we have been fortunate to have a CEO who has steered the organisation through a period of growth and enhanced the profile and reputation of our sport to make it more accessible, appealing and inclusive. Through his stature and influence in the world of golf and sport more widely, and in growing the proceeds of the Open to invest back into the game, he has been true to the R&amp;A’s purpose of golf thriving 50 years from now and has shown transformational leadership. He speaks often of reflecting history in a modern way and that will be his legacy to the R&amp;A and to the club.”</p>",

While Murray was 22 years old then, Cilic was even younger and less experienced. After a nerveless start from the Croat, Murray methodically reeled in his challenger to reach his first of five Melbourne finals in seven years.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday at the Kooyong Classic in the suburbs of the city, the pair resumed their decades‑long rivalry under less intense circumstances. Now 36 and 35 years old respectively, both players grand slam title winners, they are in the twilight of their careers and desperately trying to hold on. As Murray fights against the odds after his career-altering hip injuries, Cilic is returning after undergoing knee surgery last January.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/jan/09/emma-raducanu-pulls-out-of-pre-australian-open-charity-match-after-feeling-sore-tennis\">Raducanu pulls out of pre-Australian Open charity match after feeling ‘sore’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Their practice match in Kooyong, held in the handsome club that previously hosted the Australian Open, ended with a 6-3, 7-5 victory for Cilic as his far more consistent serving and clean, unrelenting aggression from the baseline awarded him the victory. Two poor service games from Murray, one in each set, proved the difference. </p> \n<p>Murray offered a nonchalant shrug to the result as their preparations continued. “It was all right,” he said. “I didn’t serve that well at the beginning of the match but got a bit better as it went on and had a few chances and the second set. Didn’t get them but obviously it’s always good to get some matches in and it’s always a little bit different than playing practice sets.”</p> \n<p>For Murray, the first few months of the season will be significant after his dire end to 2023. In his final match of the season, he led Alex de Minaur 5-2 in the third set at the Paris Masters, reaching match point on his serve before his lead crumbled to dust. Murray finished the season having endured five defeats in his final six matches and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/30/frustrated-andy-murray-not-enjoying-tennis-after-alex-de-minaur-loss\" title=\"\">admitted he was not enjoying himself</a>.</p> \n<p>To his credit, though, Murray immediately responded. This has been a hard off-season for the Scot as he managed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/18/andy-murray-pulls-out-of-davis-cup-tie-with-season-ending-injury\" title=\"\">the shoulder injury that forced him to end his season</a> before the Davis Cup Final 8 stage, a knee injury and illness before his December training block in Dubai. </p> \n<p>Murray was motivated enough to put in work each day. He was ever‑present at the National Tennis Centre, searching for ways to improve. He particularly identified his first serve as a weakness, with the stroke failing to offer him sufficient free points and easy second balls. Despite his physical limitations stopping him from training at full intensity throughout the off-season, he worked hard to find solutions.</p> \n<p>“If I put myself in those situations, it’s always been one of the better parts of my game,” he said of his difficulties to close out matches last year. “I never had an issue with that in my career, and last year I felt like, because I was not serving well, when it came serving for matches I was not getting many free points, ending up in long rallies. Just not feeling comfortable on the court.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully, with some improved serving and feeling a bit better about my game, when I put myself in those situations it goes well.”</p> \n<p>But the reality for Murray is clear. If he can make further progress with his game, he may remain motivated to continue pushing himself to his limits. If his form from 2023 continues, though, there will be serious questions about his future and whether his career should endure beyond this year. With the possibility of competing in one final Olympic Games on the horizon this year, 2024 offers the two-time gold medallist a clear opportunity to finally move on. For the time being, he remains positive that this will not be necessary.</p> \n<p>“I hope that I do better than last year,” he said. “I didn’t feel like I played well last year. I certainly lost a number of matches that I could have won and I know that I’ve made improvements in the off‑season and I want to put that on the match court because if I do that … I was pushing a lot of guys like De Minaur, had close matches with Fritz, Tsitsipas … I really didn’t feel good on the court at all last year so with a few improvements and feeling a bit better, I can certainly challenge the top players.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4bbca7df-b6a0-4174-a43e-6468ed784a26\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dan Evans was beaten in the last 16 of the Adelaide International as Alexander Bublik came from behind to defeat the British No 2.</p>\n    <p>After starting well to claim the first set, Evans was then broken to go 4-2 down in the second and he would secure only one of the games that followed as Kazakhstan's Bublik surged to a 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 win.</p>\n    <p>Evans, returning to action at this tournament after his 2023 campaign was ended prematurely by a calf injury, had beaten Australian Rinky Hijikata in straight sets in the previous round.

As has been the case with other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/new-orleans-catholic-church-priests-sexual-abuse-protect-children\">charged or convicted</a> clerical child rapists, Hecker has never faced expulsion from the priesthood, and there is no indication the church has ever put pressure on him to seek laicization on his own.</p> <p>One other south-eastern US priest whose laicization was sought by Catholic officials was Travis Clark, who <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/northshore/convicted-of-obscenity-former-priest-jailed-for-contempt/article_4155228a-7d5f-11ed-a6a9-db4d5dd29cf7.html\">pleaded guilty</a> in November 2022 to a criminal charge of obscenity after a passerby reported him for filming a consensual sexual encounter with two professional dominatrices atop the altar of his Pearl River, Louisiana, church.</p> <p>In regard to Crow, an expert in the theological study of demons and exorcism, the Mobile archdiocese suspended him from his clerical duties in late July after he went to Italy with an 18-year-old former student of the McGill-Toolen Catholic high school.</p> <p>Crow, 30, had said he did not intend to return to the US, and the archdiocese charged him with both abandoning his assignment as well as demonstrating behavior “totally unbecoming of a priest”.</p> <p>Catholic priests make a promise to be celibate. Amid a global, decades-old clerical molestation scandal, the church has also ostensibly sought to implement guidelines meant to establish boundaries between clergymen and their congregants.</p> <p>The parents of the teen whom Crow met when he volunteered at McGill-Toolen had been unaware she was traveling to Italy with him.</p> <p>Local sheriff’s office deputies then reviewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/18/alabama-priest-groomed-young-girls-before-fleeing-italy-teen\">allegations</a> that Crow groomed and engaged in sexual misconduct with multiple girls at McGill-Toolen. They found a love letter Crow sent to the young woman he eventually married on Valentine’s Day 2023, when she was 17.</p> <p>However, authorities later said the local district attorney would not pursue criminal charges, in part citing a lack of cooperation from the young woman who traveled to Italy with Crow.</p> <p>The pair ultimately returned to Mobile and were married through the civil court system there in November.</p> <p>Mobile archdiocesan officials said in their 5 January statement that Rodi could have moved to laicize Crow after six months of absence. Crow successfully sought laicization on his own before that period lapsed, and he does not have the option of appealing his subsequent permanent removal from the priesthood, according to the archdiocese’s statement.</p> <p>Rodi has repeatedly rebuffed suggestions that his archdiocese may have reacted slowly or reluctantly during the investigation of Crow. In its 5 January statement, the archdiocese reiterated it “had no reason to suspect Crow of any crime” but nonetheless “saw no way back to the priesthood for [him], considering his scandalous behavior”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>I am a British tourist, and I spend my holidays searching for species that are believed to be extinct. On my last trip to Papua New Guinea in 2022, I found a Louisiade pitta bird, which had been the focus of failed professional expeditions for years. It hadn’t been seen alive since 1898.</p> <p>We went around playing recordings of a related pitta, which sounds a bit like a <a href=\"https://xeno-canto.org/species/Erythropitta-meeki\">chicken being strangled</a>, until we received a reply. Imagine if you went around a haunted house rattling chains and then you heard a ghost rattling them back – that is what it was like.</p>    <p>On another trip to Papua New Guinea, I went looking for a little possum called <em>Telefomin </em><em>cuscus</em>, which was believed to have gone extinct after extensive forest fires in 1997.</p> <p>I found one, but unfortunately it was being barbecued by a local family. I really wished they had found another source of protein, but you can’t blame people for needing food.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I found one of the rare possums, but unfortunately it was being barbecued by a local family</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In total, I have found a couple of dozen of these species, most of which are plants. My favourite discovery was the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo, which looks a bit like a cuddly toy, while looking for rhododendrons in West Papua four years ago. It had only been seen once – by the guy who shot it in 1928, and that specimen is now in the Natural History Museum in London.</p> <p>It took two expeditions to find it, and a lot of machete work through thorns and bamboo thickets that become overgrown almost as soon as you cut them. It was the last day and we saw the animal just before we needed to pack up. I was relieved – I would have had quite a lot of explaining to do to my wife if I came back empty-handed.</p>    <p>My wife is very patient and supportive, but she might think it’s a bit of crazy thing to do. She never comes with me on these trips – the furthest she’s ever gone with me is Devon, and that was a trip enough for her.</p> <p>I studied zoology at the University of Oxford, and ended up working in medical communications. I do a lot of computer modelling in my day job, and now I’m creating computer models of lost species, trying to work out the best place to look for them. You have to be fairly determined.</p>    <p>I want these animals to be the poster children for seriously threatened and ancient habitats. I’m trying to get evidence of something interesting – and in terms of getting people involved and excited about conservation, it seems to be effective. I appreciate not everybody gets excited even about the most amazing plants, but they do like cuddly animals and beautiful exotic birds. If you are trying to find alternative jobs for hunters, you’ve got to think “what will tourists want to see?”, and that is what I set out to find.</p> <p>It’s a race against time to get people involved in conservation and ecotourism, as they don’t have many other options. I try to build connections between traditional landowners and organisations elsewhere to set up ecotourism facilities. That’s a way of putting food on people’s tables, and paying them to conserve their forests, which is what most people want to do.</p>    <p>It’s hard to know if things will change fast enough for there to be anything left. In the 1990s, Papua New Guinea was just a big forest, with a few people. Now it’s still 80% or 90% forest, but there is huge pressure from people and investors who want to make palm oil. That’s a form of development which brings money to the region, but also builds major roads going up into the mountains.</p> <p>My tips for people who want to get into this are all very basic: keep fit, travel light, study the terrain and brush up your languages. Look after your porters and never try to rush discussions with local leaders.</p>    <p>I can move fast with a small team of people with local knowledge, and try to avoid unwanted attention. I’ve had misadventures in the past with everyone from gorilla poachers in Cameroon to secret policemen in Burma, so I don’t want a “travelling circus”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/04/i-discovered-ekwoge-abwe-cameroon-chimpanzees-aoe\">I discovered … a group of chimps that were using tools to crack open nuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for the future, I don’t know. I’m self-funded so I’m always short of cash.

            "body" : "<p>The first place that Max Schranz moved into after leaving his family home is the kind that many young professionals dream of inhabiting at the peak of their career. At only 26, he lives in a bright fifth-floor apartment with high ceilings overlooking a European capital city, 10 minutes from the central station and within walking distance of cinemas, theatres and bars.</p> <p>No lottery win or parental trust fund was needed to make that dream a reality: Schranz, who is a master’s student, pays €596 (£512) a month for his 54 sq metre two-bedroom apartment – a fraction of typical rents for similarly sized and similarly located apartments in other major European cities. What’s more, he didn’t have to put down a deposit and his rental contract is unlimited – in theory, he’s allowed to pass it on to his children or a sibling when he eventually decides to move on. “I’m aware it’s a pretty stress-free existence,” Schranz says. “My friends in other European cities are a bit jealous.”</p> <p>Welcome to Vienna, the city that may have cracked the code of how to keep inner-city housing affordable. As other cities battle spiralling rental prices, partly fuelled by inner-city apartments being used as short-term holiday rentals or being kept strategically vacant by property speculators, the Austrian capital bucks the trend. In the place that last year retained its crown as the world’s most livable city in the Economist’s annual index, Vienna’s renters on average pay roughly a third of their counterparts in London, Paris or Dublin, according to a <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/at/Documents/presse/at-deloitte-property-index-2023.pdf\">recent study by the accounting firm Deloitte</a>.</p> <p>Part of the reason Schranz’s apartment is so affordable is simple: it’s owned by the city. In Vienna, that is (almost) the norm. The landlord of approximately 220,000 socially rented apartments, it is the largest home-owning city in Europe (in London, which has more than 800,000 socially rented apartments, they are owned by the local councils). A quarter of the people who live in Vienna are social tenants – if you also include the approximately 200,000 co-operative dwellings built with municipal subsidies, it’s more than half the population.</p> <p>Many of these apartments came into being a century ago, as part of an enormously ambitious building programme after the end of the first world war, when Vienna was awash with people uprooted by the collapse of the Habsburg empire. Funded primarily through a hypothecated tax on<strong> </strong>luxuries such as champagne or horse-riding, the inaugural phase of socialist-governed “Red Vienna” saw 65,000 socially rented apartments shoot up within the city by the time of the Nazi coup attempt in 1934.</p> <p>These “superblocks” from the 20s and 30s don’t look like ordinary social housing. With the modernist ideals of the contemporaneous Bauhaus school yet to capture the imagination of Austrian architects, for one, they haven’t got flat roofs. The most famous examples of Red Vienna social housing, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/27/vienna-karl-marx-hof-architecture-politics-ideology-history-cities-50-buildings\">Karl Marx-Hof in the 19th district</a> or the estates dotted along the “Ring Road of the Proletariat” on Margaretengürtel, look more like castles or monasteries, with art deco flourishes on their facades. As the historian Eve Blau has put it: “If you’re planning something radical, it’s not a bad idea to come across as conservative as possible.”</p>    <p>The majority of Vienna’s council estates were built after the second world and look more familiar, but even they don’t tend to have the stigma of poverty and crime associated with similar developments in the US or Europe. Schranz’s apartment is inside the Theodor Körner-Hof, a 50s-built group of 14 housing blocks in the Margareten district that are far from fancy, yet still well-maintained enough that Schranz likes to hang out in the green inner courtyards on summer evenings to read his books.</p> <p>The Viennese term for estates like these is <em>Gemeindebauten</em>, “communal buildings”, which hints at their underlying philosophy. “One of the key concepts to understanding Vienna’s approach to housing is social sustainability,” says Maik Novotny, an architecture critic for the Austrian newspaper Der Standard. “In order to avoid the creation of ghettoes and the costly social conflicts that come with them, the city actively strives for a mixing of people from different backgrounds and on different incomes in the same estates. Social housing isn’t just for the poor.”</p> <p>As a student without a disability or any dependants, Schranz would have no hope of applying for social housing in countries such as the UK, but in Vienna the city courted him via a programme for first-time tenants under 30.</p>    <p>“Keeping a mix of people from different paths of life in social housing is key, and yes, it isn’t always easy,” says Kathrin Gaal, Vienna’s deputy mayor and executive councillor for housing. One tactic is an income maximum for applicants of €57,600 a year for single people and €85,830 for two-person households. But “once you’ve moved into a <em>Gemeindebau</em> as a young student, if you start earning more once your career progresses, we don’t check in on you, because your situation could also worsen again,” says Gaal.</p> <p>Vienna’s social housing programme is more than a policy – in the city it is a foundational ideal that is a source of immense pride. And as with similar progressive achievements that command a political consensus – the UK’s National Health Service, say, or Norway’s oil fund – that can create blindspots in the national debate. Talk to <em>Gemeindebau </em>residents such as 76-year-old Heinz Barnerth, a retired mechanical engineer who has lived for the past seven decades in the Reumannhof estate in Margareten, and he will be unswerving in his praise of the idea that brought his block into existence in the 1920s. “Vienna’s model is more timely than ever, because rental prices are hard to contain,” he says.</p> <p>But the reality doesn’t always live up to the ideal, and Barnerth is even more animated when complaining about the time it takes the city to carry out repairs in his estate. The light by the stairs leading to the basement hasn’t been working for three weeks, and when a door lock breaks, the residents usually don’t bother waiting for central management to fix it. “If you don’t sort a handyman to repair the lock overnight, the junkies try to break in,” he says. One of the downsides of having a single large company, Wiener Wohnen, in charge of managing and maintaining so much housing stock in the city is that logging and commissioning caretakers’ tasks can lead to bottlenecks.</p> <p>The other downside of the Vienna model is that while 60% of the city’s residents have hit the jackpot by getting into a <em>Gemeindebau</em> or subsidised co-op, that still excludes<strong> </strong>a large chunk of the population of a city in which 80% are renters. Only those who have resided permanently in Vienna for two years can apply for social housing, and those who stay in private rentals face problems more familiar from other European cities.</p>    <p>“Twenty years ago, private rentals in Vienna were mostly low quality and low price,” says Justin Kadi, an assistant professor in planning and housing at University of Cambridge. “But in recent years, private rentals have transformed into a segment of Vienna’s housing market that is in many cases not just high quality, but also quite expensive.”</p> <p>This, he explains, was largely due to deregulation in the mid-90s, which allowed landlords to charge tenants not just for size and equipment standards, but also for location, often leading to<strong> </strong>arbitrary mark-ups. As part of the same reforms, it became easier for landlords to limit contracts, putting private renters in Vienna in a less secure position.</p> <p>“The only thing that other European cities can learn from Vienna is their marketing,” says Harald Simons, a Berlin-based economist and researcher who published a scathing analysis of the Viennese housing market in 2020. Vienna, Europe’s second-largest German-speaking city, has “an income structure that is more like Berlin’s but average new rental prices similar to those of a high-income city like Hamburg”, Simon says. He criticises Wiener Wohnen for its opaque accounting, suggesting its finances are in direr straits than the Vienna’s senate admits, and that the city’s underspending on maintenance is driving the middle-income earners so desired for the social mix into private rentals.</p> <p>And yet, there are good reasons why Vienna’s social housing model has attracted renewed attention and regular visits from international policymakers recently.</p>    <p>The crucial difference is in the trend. While the number of homes in London’s socially rented sector has stayed broadly stable, at about 800,000, for example, its share of the city’s housing stock <a href=\"https://centreforlondon.org/reader/londons-homes-today/chapter-1/\">continues to fall</a>, partly due to them being converted into privately owned homes via the right-to-buy scheme, and in part because of the lack of new homes being built while the UK capital continues to grow. Figures released just before Christmas show that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66296333\">105,000 households in the UK are trapped in temporary accommodation</a> because of a shortage of social housing. Many cities in continental Europe battle with similar problems: Berlin, for example, having missed its target for 20,000 new homes in 2022, only managed to build about 16,000 last year.</p> <p>Vienna, by contrast, has the advantage of being in a monopoly position that it has never relinquished. “We never succumbed to the temptation of selling off our municipal or subsidised apartments in the way many other European cities did to plug holes in their budgets,” Gaal says. “It means our stock of housing is still vast.”</p> <p>About 40 years ago, Vienna started a “land procurement and urban renewal fund” that reserves land in the city exclusively for social housing: it currently has 3m sq metres of space, including farm or fallow land, disused rail tracks and empty<strong> </strong>hospitals, that it can exclusively put out to tender to social developers. “That kind of systemic stockpiling might be something that other countries could get started on too,” Gaal says.</p> <p>In 2019, Vienna introduced <a href=\"https://socialhousing.wien/tools/urban-development-and-land-policy\">a new zoning rule</a> that means that in developments with more than 5,000 sq metres of living space, two-thirds must be subsidised housing. “For cities, the question is always whether they have a good bargaining position with land owners,” even Vienna-sceptic Simons concedes. “And Vienna has a good bargaining position.” The city’s land procurement fund coordinates closely with the department that hands out planning permissions, and can strike deals accordingly.</p> <p>Whether Vienna will reach its target of building 5,500 new <em>Gemeindebau </em>apartments by 2025 remains to be seen, and whether that will be enough if the city is expected to return to its 1910 population levels by 2038 is another question entirely. But it is taking tangible steps. After an 11-year freeze on new social housing developments, the city resumed building new <em>Gemeindebau </em>blocks in 2015, and has earmarked €557m for new developments in 2024. One of the most recent to be completed, by the local architecture firm WUP, lies about 7km east of the city centre in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/14/city-with-a-female-face-how-modern-vienna-was-shaped-by-women\">Seestadt Aspern, a new urban centre</a> growing on the site of a former airfield.</p>    <p>Margarete Stoklassa, 73, and her husband moved into one of the 74 apartments from an estate in the city centre last April because they needed barrier-free access, and seem more than pleased. At 50 sq metres their new home is not huge, but a circular floorplan and several sliding walls mean that “I sometimes end up playing hide-and-seek with my husband,” says Stoklassa. “I am very happy; everything I need is here.” The couple pay €520 in rent a month.</p> <p>The facades of the new-era <em>Gemeindebau </em>are painted in chalky reds, blues and greens that reference the mighty fortresses of the Red Vienna period, although with prices of building materials peaking during the construction phase, there is plenty of bare concrete and galvanised steel. “The rise in the cost of raw materials forced us to concentrate on what social housing is really about,” says the architect Bernhard Weinberger. Having prevailed for more than a century, Vienna’s ideals of communal living have shown they can stand the test of time. “This building should still be standing in 200 years,” he says.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 January 2024 to correct a caption reference for the date when Matteotti-Hof was built.</p> <p><em><strong>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>The names just keep rolling in for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/inter-miami\">Inter Miami</a>.</p> <p>When Lionel Messi joined the club midway through the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/mls\">MLS</a> season, Miami quickly added Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba – two of Messi’s teammates from his time at Barcelona. Then, just before the new year, Inter Miami added another former Barcelona player to their squad in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/24/the-messi-effect-luis-suarez-is-inter-miamis-latest-landmark-signing\">striker Luis Suárez</a>.</p> <p>The La Liga exiles are congregating in south Florida, but they’re not the only ones heading for Miami. Wide playmaker Julian Gressel, who has made a handful of appearances for the US men’s national team and is a two-time MLS Cup winner, is also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InterMiamiCF/status/1744767603673858552\">heading to Inter Miami</a>. The club also appears to be after talent from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1740471788063043735\">Boca Juniors</a> and other big clubs in South America.</p> <p>Many are feeling optimistic about Miami ahead of the new MLS season. After Tata Martino’s team lifted the Leagues Cup in 2023, why shouldn’t they be? They’ll clearly be among the league’s top teams in 2024, with a double or even a treble within reach. But while a successful 2024, involving more hardware than last year, is possible, it’s also not guaranteed for Inter Miami.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/24/the-messi-effect-luis-suarez-is-inter-miamis-latest-landmark-signing\">The Messi effect: Luis Suárez is Inter Miami’s latest landmark signing | Ryan Baldi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It doesn’t matter if you’re Inter Miami or any other club vying to dominate their region, you’re always forced to contend with a sort of push-and-pull when you try to build a super team: the world’s most valuable attacking players love, well, to attack … and so rarely want to defend.</p> <p>It’s no surprise that when Messi and Friends moved to Florida, Miami struggled without the ball.</p> <p>Now, they weren’t awful defensively. Super teams – and Inter Miami are no exception here – do just about everything they can to keep the ball and avoid having to sit deep inside their own half. That way, their superstars have as many chances as possible to, well, <em>be superstars</em>. But even the best teams in the world relative to their competition don’t have possession for anything close to 100% of every game.</p> <p>So what happens when they lose it?</p> <p>This is where the biggest teams in Europe have a big advantage over their competition that Miami lack over theirs. Teams like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/parisstgermain\">PSG</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid\">Real Madrid</a>, ones that play with a bunch of uber-talented attackers, also tend to have uber-talented defenders.</p> <p>During his time at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona\">Barcelona</a> and PSG, Messi played with a collection of the best defenders of all time. He, and the rest of Inter Miami’s upper-class attackers, don’t have that luxury in MLS. With the league’s rules designed to promote competitive balance by capping spending on most roster spots, Miami can only allocate so many resources to defensive positions while shelling out for Messi, Suárez and others.</p>    <p>So Inter Miami’s roster includes a handful of players who are too good to defend. It also includes many other lesser players in key positions who will be exposed against high-level opposing attackers.</p> <p>Looking back to last year, they were a below average defensive team during the final stretch of the regular season with Messi and Co in the squad. According to American Soccer Analysis, Miami were ranked 19th out of MLS’s 29 teams in expected goals allowed a game (1.43) and 16th in goals allowed a game (1.42) over their final 12 matches.</p> <p>In 2024, they’ll continue to have defensive issues. And they’ll have them at both ends.</p> <p>Starting at the front – the great Johan Cruyff referred to his striker as his “first defender” – Inter Miami’s defensive shape was often broken towards the end of last year. Messi doesn’t tend to engage outside of a quick push immediately after losing the ball. Adding Suárez, who will be 37 by the time the new season kicks off, into their frontline won’t help shore up their defensive work. For much of this year, Miami will be playing without a first defender (or a second).</p> <p>It’s easy to imagine big moments in 2024 where opposing teams brush past the top of Inter Miami’s defensive shape, overload the remaining outfield players, and break towards goal. It’s easy to imagine because it happened plenty in 2023.</p> <p>Here’s just one example from last year’s Leagues Cup, a competition between MLS and Liga MX teams, when Miami played Cruz Azul:</p>    <p>Cruz Azul were able to move the ball between seamlessly between Miami’s defensive line while Inter’s forward partnership, including Messi, stood around and watched:</p>    <p>Shifting to the backline, Miami’s current first-choice defense is entirely built of players who are either older than 30 or younger than 20. Gressel and DeAndre Yedlin, who will both likely see time at right back, are 30. At left back, Jordi Alba is 34. At center back, Ukrainian Serhiy Kryvtsov is 32, while Tomás Avilés is just 19. Toss in Busquets, a 35-year-old defensive midfielder, and you’ve got a lot of miles on those legs. Or, in the case of Avilés, not enough.</p> <p>Inter Miami already know they’ll struggle without the ball in 2024. They accepted that the moment they landed Messi. The implicit bet the club is making this year, though, is that their defensive issues<em> just won’t matter</em>. Their attack will be so good, the bet dictates, that they’ll score two goals for every one they allow.</p> <p>Somewhat curiously, Inter Miami’s attack wasn’t elite last year after the reinforcements arrived. They were 10th in goals a game (1.58) and 12th in xG a game (1.47) in the regular season after their roster overhaul, per ASA. To be fair, half of those games were without Messi, though there was no major distinction with our without him in the lineup. A full preseason and an even stronger attacking group should turn a good attack into a great one.</p> <p>With a roster full of young, healthy elite players competing without a Copá America-sized gap squarely in the middle of the season, betting on the attack to make up for their own defensive vulnerabilities would seem safe enough. But Inter Miami don’t have that roster, nor do they have the luxury of playing in a league that aligns itself with the calendar of the international game.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/messi-in-new-jersey-fourteen-host-cities-selected-for-2024-copa-america\">Copá America</a>, which runs from 20 June to 14 July, will probably see Miami play without Messi for more than <em>a fifth</em> of their regular season schedule if Argentina make a run to the final. Inter Miami have seven games either in or right around those tournament dates. The Paris Olympics, with its men’s soccer tournament running from 24 July to 10 August, could also see Miami lose multiple players during the Leagues Cup.</p> <p>Between those two international tournaments, Inter Miami’s chances to win the Supporters’ Shield as the best regular season team in MLS and their hopes of repeating their Leagues Cup title drop. They don’t drop nearly to zero. But they do drop.</p> <p>Miami’s margin for error is more narrow than many think, despite assembling top players in a region where it’s easy to stand out. It seems foolish to pick against them to win <em>a</em> trophy this year, especially not with five there for the taking – if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/20/us-soccer-rejects-mlss-plan-to-pull-teams-from-open-cup\">MLS teams do indeed play in the US Open Cup</a>. But collecting a few trophies to match sky-high expectations? With obvious defensive frailties and real player availability issues lurking in the background, that’s no simple task.</p> <p>Even the biggest club in MLS isn’t immune to disappointment.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Fourteen seconds. That’s how close the Detroit Pistons were to a championship in Game 6 of the 1988 NBA finals. Leading by one point over the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, Detroit had possession. Then momentum shifted: A referee made a much-discussed foul call on the Pistons’ controversial center, Bill Laimbeer. The decision put Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at the line; he made both free throws. LA went on to win, then prevailed in a similarly dramatic Game 7 for the title.</p> <p>This is a pivotal moment from a new book by Rich Cohen called When the Game Was War: The NBA’s Greatest Season. The book argues that the excitement, excellence and revolutionary star play of the 1987-88 season set an unparalleled standard.</p> <p>“One of the reasons I love that season,” Cohen says, “is that I think it had the most Hall of Famers who were not just Hall of Famers but at the top of Hall of Famers, the top 20 of all time, the greatest players of the era.”</p> <p>The book focuses on the four top teams of that memorable season, and their respective leaders. The Showtime Lakers of Magic Johnson captured their second consecutive championship. Thomas’s Pistons fell just short, but went on to win the next two titles. The up-and-coming Chicago Bulls of Michael Jordan still had to wait for their incredible run of six championships in eight years during the following decade, while the Boston Celtics of Larry Bird saw their dynasty crumble, largely due to age and injury.</p> <p>Appropriately, that season’s finals featured plenty of drama, including between Johnson and Thomas. Despite playing on rival teams, they were longtime friends, and before each game of the championship series, they kissed each other at center court. Then, according to the book, Lakers coach Pat Riley challenged Johnson to choose between his friend and his team.</p> <p>“He made that choice,” Cohen says. “He laid out Isiah, knocked him down coming in the lane. It escalated from there.”</p> <p>Both stars delivered clutch performances in the series. Despite a crushing ankle injury, Thomas nearly led the Pistons to a title. In Game 7, Johnson started a key sequence with a 360-degree spin move. Beyond the team leaders, there was plenty of talent on both squads. Although Johnson’s spin was a catalyst, it was his teammate James Worthy who eventually scored, while in the final seconds, AC Green closed things out with a layup.</p> <p>As for the oldest player featured in the book, Cohen says, “Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, you can argue, was the No 1 player of all time – the top three or four, for sure.”</p> <p>The book is written in an engaging style, occasionally referencing history and culture, even as it chronicles the hard-nosed, expletive-filled narrative on the court and in the locker room.</p>    <p>“It’s just the way that I experience the world,” Cohen says. “I always look for things that transcend the game.” Yet, he adds, he wrote the book out of admiration for “the game, the players”, an admiration that includes those who made unconventional choices in retirement. On that list is Detroit standout Adrian Dantley, who later became a school crossing guard.</p> <p>As for Dantley’s teammate Dennis Rodman, the book notes his colorful post-Pistons career, from joining the Bulls dynasty to relationships with Madonna and Carmen Electra to visiting North Korea. “You probably know what happened to Dennis Rodman,” Cohen writes, “because it’s still happening.” He adds, “Of all the great players of his era, Dennis has lived the weirdest and most uniquely American life.”</p> <p>In addition to the talent at the championship level, there were many other brilliant players in the league that season. Atlanta Hawks star Dominique Wilkins engaged in an epic playoff duel with the Celtics’ Bird. The Utah Jazz boasted the duo of Karl Malone and John Stockton at the onset of the historic partnership. Patrick Ewing, Clyde Drexler and Akeem (later Hakeem) Olajuwon were making impacts on the New York Knicks, Portland Trail Blazers and Houston Rockets, respectively.</p> <p>“All were playing at the same time,” Cohen marvels. “There was an incredible variety of talent out there.”</p> <p>As you might guess, the author is an NBA fan. Raised in the Chicago area, he and his siblings grew up playing basketball with their father as the hometown Bulls blossomed into a contender. In 1987-88, when Cohen was 19, the sensational Jordan averaged 35 points per game. Yet the era was about more than scoring: Cohen could also appreciate the defensive approach the Pistons used to shut down the Bulls star: the Jordan Rules.</p> <p>Cohen explains that this unorthodox strategy meant letting Jordan score for the first three-plus quarters of a game. Late in the third quarter, the tactics would shift: When Jordan got the ball and approached the basket, Detroit would clobber him. According to the author, the benefits were multiple – Jordan might get angry and lose his composure, or he might pass to a teammate who was open but hadn’t shot much by that point.</p> <p>“It was not only a strategy about Jordan but his teammates,” Cohen says.</p> <p>Depth, by contrast, wasn’t a problem for Detroit. In addition to stars such as Thomas, Laimbeer, Dantley and Joe Dumars, the Pistons featured a strong supporting cast that included Rodman, Vinnie Johnson, Rick Mahorn and James “Buddha” Edwards.</p> <p>“One of the things that made [the Pistons] so great – and why they’re not ranked as high as they should be – is that their strength was depth,” Cohen says. “I think they would be very proud to say that nobody on the team that won a championship the next year averaged more than 20 points a night. They spread it out.”</p> <p>As the book explains, the Pistons were ideally positioned to wear down not only the Bulls, but also the Celtics. The rough play epitomized by Laimbeer was part of Detroit’s strategy for toppling Boston, the 1981, 1984 and 1986 NBA champions who were themselves a notoriously physical team.</p> <p>Cohen paraphrases a quote from Sam Vincent, who played for both the Celtics and Bulls that season, on the Pistons’ plan: “We have to build an even nastier team than the Celtics, we have to out-bully the bullies.”</p> <p>In general, Cohen reflects, “a team is built for a specific task – to beat another team.” The four teams profiled in the book “kind of produced each other”, he says, and that season, they were “all good at the same time”.</p> <p>The book also chronicles a series of controversies relating to the players, including between Johnson and Thomas following Magic’s 1991 diagnosis of HIV. According to the book, the diagnosis ruptured their friendship – “word came back that Zeke had not called because Zeke believed that Magic was gay … Isiah denies this, but it doesn’t matter. This was the last nail.” The book also notes that some of its subjects had checkered personal lives, including the Celtics’ Robert Parish and Dennis Johnson, both of whom were accused of domestic abuse, with Johnson jailed for it. Thomas’ post-Pistons years also come in for scrutiny, such as his disastrous tenure as the Knicks’ head of basketball operations, during which he was accused of sexual harassment and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/11/isiah-thomass-revisionist-history-proves-nothings-changed-at-msg\">the team paid over $11m in a settlement</a>.</p> <p>While Cohen acknowledges these controversies, he also writes that the action on the court that season provided him with a respite from the era’s geopolitical tensions – and with a level of basketball excellence he maintains is the best ever. Emphasizing that latter point is a memento on his desk: a brick from the long-destroyed Chicago Stadium, where Jordan made so many great plays. As Cohen puts it: “It conjures a time when the game was better than it had ever been, or will be.”</p>",

Voters were likely to be targeted by hostile states and domestic actors, she added.</p> <p>In the longer term, the five top risks are identified as extreme weather events; critical change to earth systems; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; natural resource shortages; and misinformation and disinformation.</p> <p>Two-thirds of those polled were worried about extreme weather events in 2024, but there were differing views on the urgency of the risks posed. The report said private sector respondents believed that most environmental risks would materialise over a longer timeframe than civil society or government, pointing to the growing risk of getting past a point of no return.</p> <p>Zahidi said: “This is a very gloomy outlook but it is not a prediction of the future. The future is very much in our hands.”</p>",

The court heard Hamburger had had two recent cataract operations.</p> <p>In a victim impact statement read to the court, the couple’s son, Robin Barton, said: “As well as what we lost that day, I’m struck by what my parents lost – 2023 would have been their 50th wedding anniversary and they should have enjoyed many more years together. The privilege of driving should be more tightly regulated with more regular retests.”</p> <p>His sister, Georgina Abbott, said: “I think we should all be retested at a certain age. Relying on a driver to declare their incapacity just isn’t a robust system and endangers the lives of themselves and others.”</p> <p>Russell Pyne, prosecuting, told the court the crash took place on the afternoon of 7 January on a B road between Alton and Selborne in Hampshire. He said the conditions were clear and dry.</p> <p>Pyne said Hamburger pulled out in his VW Golf into the path of the Bartons. “He either didn’t see their approach at all, or wholly failed to judge how soon they would reach that junction.”</p> <p>In mitigation, Rupert Hallowes said Hamburger could offer no explanation as to why it had happened. He said: “He had been passed as fit to drive – and has complied in every conceivable way with the law of the land.”</p> <p>Judge Angela Morris said: “The VW Tiguan should have been clearly visible if you had been exercising all due regard to the road.

What on earth is going on here? Being relegated used to be a punishment, not a way to just do a deep clean of the squad, which by the way is already looking healthy enough. In their most recent victory over Millwall, Leicester had on their bench: Wales No 1 Danny Ward, England internationals James Justin and Harry Winks, Belgium international Wout Faes (who arrived on Premier League wages for £15m), Denmark international Jannik Vestergaard, Stephy Mavididi (signed for £7.5m in the summer), Fatawu Issahaku (on loan from Sporting Lisbon), Tawanda Maswanhise and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (easily a Premier League player).

            "body" : "<p>Realistically, there are only two reasons anyone would ever want to listen to a podcast named The Queen’s Reading Room. The first is that they really like reading. The second – and I can tell you’re already way ahead of me here – is that they really like the Queen. So it brings me nothing but dismay to inform you that a full 50% of The Queen’s Reading Room listeners are doomed to come away from the endeavour feeling bitterly disappointed.</p> <p>The Queen’s Reading Room is the podcast offshoot of <a href=\"https://thequeensreadingroom.co.uk/\">Queen Camilla’s charity-slash-bookclub</a> where she recommends books for her loyal subjects to read (titles thus far have included Frankenstein, Lessons in Chemistry – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/01/monarchy.features\">The Year of Eating Dangerously</a> by an obscure young up-and-comer by the name of Tom Parker Bowles). The thought of expanding this pursuit into podcasts seems like a natural one, since hearing the Queen discuss her favourite books at length – perhaps with people whose backgrounds would help to challenge her interpretations – would surely be the ideal way to humanise an aloof and out-of-touch monarchy.</p> <p>Well, tough luck. That isn’t what The Queen’s Reading Room is at all. Instead, it is a deeply generic author interview podcast where Camilla sort of pops up at the end to tersely announce that she quite likes Harry Potter but refuses to do the voices, before rapidly retreating in a cloud of cigarette smoke and gin fumes. In other words, this isn’t the sort of thing you’d listen to if you wanted to learn anything about the Queen at all.</p> <p>The first episode belongs to Sir Ian Rankin, who gamely spends 20 minutes answering a number of slightly nondescript questions about his favourite books. The podcast’s weird format means that all the actual questions have been edited out of the audio, which gives the impression that Rankin has been forced to directionlessly free-associate about himself under literal pain of death. He was on the <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/booked/ian-rankin\">You’re Booked podcast</a> in October with an actual, flesh and blood interviewer, and was infinitely more engaged and charming.</p> <p>The second episode is a little fizzier, by dint of the fact that its subject is Joanna Lumley. Less celebrated an author than Rankin (her published work includes three memoirs, two travel books and a “celebration of Queen Elizabeth II”), she nevertheless comes across as excitable and conspiratorial, and often addresses the listeners directly during her entertainingly scatty sermons about the joys of reading for pleasure. Lumley is so good, in fact, that you find yourself wanting to stage a republican revolution to install her as the leader, so that she’ll get to do this podcast instead of Camilla.</p> <p>What a waste of a potentially winning premise this is. Had Camilla gone in with both feet, the podcast still could have been a disaster, but at least it would have been an interesting one. Maybe if she could have recorded the opening introduction herself, rather than foisting it off on a lackey, the enterprise would have had a bit of personality. If she’d have gone one better, and fully committed to the genre by doing intermittent blank-eyed sponsored ad reads for vitamin supplements and Amazon Prime Video, I might have been inclined to listen regularly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-sMeYs9RH4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4-sMeYs9RH4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>At least they have personality … Sarah Ferguson’s YouTube video content.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>We’re left with an immensely hollow feeling. There are already enough podcasts in the world, so the last thing we need is one by a woman who can’t even be bothered to show up properly. And it’s not like there was even a high bar to clear here. Before The Queen’s Reading Room, the only member of the royal family putting literary content online was Sarah Ferguson, who liked to dress up and read children’s books on YouTube. Her videos are like something filmed by a hostage to send coded messages to their family, but at least they have some personality. On the basis of its first two episodes, this is something that The Queen’s Reading Room is never likely to achieve.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Plate-sized mushrooms have been sprouting from the living room wall in Natasha La’Bow’s council flat in Lewisham, south London. She and her son have lived with mould for years but the problem is getting worse. One day last week, she stood in the damp-reeking room and wept. “I have considered putting my kid into care but I just can’t,” she said as tears rolled down her cheeks.</p> <p>Her six-year-old son has recently been diagnosed with breathing difficulties and prescribed inhalers. He runs around in a superhero costume but she will not let him in the living room without a surgical mask.</p> <p>The family GP suspected his symptoms were “to do with living with the mould”, La’Bow said, adding: “He is not quite at the stage where he can’t breathe.”</p> <p>It is a terrifying prospect for any parent living with a child in a mouldy home. Awareness of the serious risks soared after a coroner found mould had caused the death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak in a Rochdale social housing flat. In November, his father <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/16/father-of-boy-killed-by-mould-in-flat-urges-tenants-with-similar-issue-to-get-out\">urged</a> families in mouldy homes to simply “get out”. But it is not that easy amid a chronic shortage of social housing.</p> <p>Doctors warn that people who regularly breathe in air that smells of fungus are likely to be inhaling mycotoxins that can lead to ill health.</p> <p>The problem La’Bow, 45, is experiencing appears to be getting worse nationally. In the 10 months since March, the housing ombudsman for England, Richard Blakeway, made 721 findings related to damp, mould and leaks, more than for the previous 12 months and several times more than in 2020-01.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/2023/12/12/special-investigation-into-three-london-landlords/\">Last month</a>, Blakeway launched special investigations into Camden council, Hackney council and Hyde Group, one of the country’s biggest social landlords, after casework showed all three were struggling with damp and mould, repairs and complaint handling. In recent months, councils in <a href=\"https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/2023/08/15/vulnerable-children-left-in-damp-and-mould-after-complaint-handling-failures-by-stoke-on-trent-city-council/\">Stoke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/2023/08/22/newham-council-to-pay-5400-after-failing-to-resolve-damp-and-mould-issues-for-over-three-years/\">Newham</a>, <a href=\"https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/2023/08/01/barking-and-dagenham-council-ordered-to-pay-6000-after-property-condition-forced-family-to-share-one-bedroom/\">Barking and Dagenham</a> have been found guilty of severe maladministration over handling mould.</p>    <p>In her home, La’Bow insists on wearing a mask “because I have been hospitalised twice with pneumonia – in March and May last year”. One bout led to sepsis, a potentially fatal illness. She said she had fungal skin conditions and problems with her sinuses that may also be related to the mould.</p> <p>The floppy brown fungus is possibly <em>Peziza domiciliana</em><em>,</em> or domicile cup fungus, which is known to live on very damp wood and plaster but also in caves.

Last year, the housing ombudsman “found severe maladministration by the landlord in handling a resident’s damp and mould complaint”, <a href=\"https://councilmeetings.lewisham.gov.uk/documents/g8044/Public%20reports%20pack%2028th-Nov-2023%2019.00%20Housing%20Select%20Committee.pdf?T=10\">council papers</a> show.</p> <p>Lewisham council said Regenter B3’s repairs contractor had previously carried out works to address damp and mould at La’Bow’s flat, including repairing a gutter leak and more work would take place this week.</p> <p>A spokesperson said it would follow up “to ensure the works are completed to the tenant’s satisfaction”.</p> <p>La’Bow’s teenage daughter recently moved out to stay with her grandmother. One room in the flat is uninhabitable and she sleeps in the same bed as her son.</p> <p>More than anything, the family needs a non-toxic home. After this reporter left the property last week, there was heavy rain and La’Bow texted: “More rain pounding down. More damp, more mould, more stink, more illness.”</p> <p>The social housing regulator believes about 88,000 households are living with serious damp and mould problems. The situation is worse in the private rented sector but the conditions in social housing have received greater attention from the government as a result of the death of Awaab from respiratory failure caused by mould in December 2020.</p> <p>In September, the department of levelling up, housing and communities issued <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damp-and-mould-understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-for-rented-housing-providers/understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-of-damp-and-mould-in-the-home--2#identifying-and-addressing-damp-and-mould-in-your-property\">guidance</a> to landlords that stated they “should always respond promptly and address this issue as a matter of urgency when there is significant damp and mould and/or when there is a significant concern for tenant health”.</p> <p>But while the government has promised to introduce Awaab’s law, giving strict deadlines for social landlords to tackle mould, it has yet to bring it into effect, saying it will do so only when parliamentary time allows.</p> <p>Meanwhile, last month the Nottingham coroner warned of “a risk that future deaths could occur” when it ordered Mansfield district council to take action to tackle mould across its 6,500 council homes. The move came after a tenant, Jane Bennett, 52, died last year from respiratory failure that doctors said may have been caused by exposure to mould.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 January 2024. A coroner found mould had caused the death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak in a Rochdale social housing flat, not in a Rochdale council flat as an earlier version said. The flat in question was managed by Rochdale Boroughwide Housing.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Here’s a documentary about a vanished woman that is not true crime (unless crimes against feminism count). It is about trailblazing American sex researcher Shere Hite, exploring how she disappeared from the who’s who of 20th-century feminists. In 1976, Hite became famous almost overnight with the publication of her groundbreaking book The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality. Based on an anonymous survey of 3,000 women about their sex lives, it sold 48m copies. Hite’s big finding was that 70% of women didn’t orgasm from penetrative sex – breaking news in the late 1970s.</p> <p>Hite had been working as a model to pay her way as a PhD student when she joined New York’s feminist movement. The tipping point came when she appeared in a sexist typewriter advert (caption: “The typewriter so smart she doesn’t have to be”). Archive footage offers a vivid picture of the energy and revolutionary spirit of 70s feminism. Director Nicole Newnham gets brilliant interviews, too: funny and intelligent, with activists, academics and psychologists who knew Hite. And then there is Hite herself, magnetic presence from the archive: fragile-looking beauty with an intellect as sharp as nails, who could debate any politician under the table. Dakota Johnson does a wonderful voiceover reading her diary entries.</p> <p>The Hite Report sparked something in women who had felt guilty or inadequate about sex for years. Some men felt threatened, accusing Hite of being a man-hater (for them, the message of the book was: women don’t need a man). Appearing alongside Hite on a chatshow is David Hasselhoff who, sniggering like a schoolboy, says he’s never had any complaints about good old-fashioned sex-sex. Hite arches an eyebrow, amused. Right, Hoff.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ZbAzd77aA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y6ZbAzd77aA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>However, Hite was ridiculed for having posed in Playboy as a young model and her methodology was discredited. (Frustratingly, whether or not these attacks on her research credibility were valid isn’t discussed.) The backlash gained momentum in the 80s, with the rise of the religious right. There’s a clip of Hite on The Oprah Winfrey Show in front of an all-male audience; the hostility is almost unwatchable. She left the US, living in self-imposed exile in Europe, finally settling in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/15/shere-hite-obituary\">where she died in 2020</a>.</p> <p>What a fascinating film about a fascinating woman this is. It’s beautifully filmed, too. Hite loved working with photographers and understood the power of images. The portraits she collaborated on with the German photographer Iris Brosch are astonishing: Hite poses in water, a pre-Raphaelite beauty like Millais’ Ophelia, but she is no victim. This is a woman in control, holding a pen, not flowers, with a steady gaze at the lens. If this documentary doesn’t make Hite a household name among a new generation of feminists, the biopic that should really follow it certainly will.</p> <p>• The Disappearance of Shere Hite is released on 12 January in UK cinemas.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>There are myriad plays about marriage. Far fewer about the wedding ceremony itself. But this month London theatregoers are invited to attend a couple of them. In the case of Sam Holcroft’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/24/a-mirror-review-pirandellian-wedding-drama-throws-a-bouquet-of-unrealities\">A Mirror</a>, transferring from the Almeida to the Trafalgar theatre, we are quite literally among the guests. Beth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Down, at the Dorfman, makes us witnesses of working-class Sylvia’s wedding to her Polish groom: an event that reveals the rancour lurking beneath the surface of a boisterous family get-together. When one of the characters says “It wouldn’t be much of a wedding without a punch-up” it set me thinking how rarely, in the theatre, people get happily spliced. I have come up with five plays that suggest that the wedding day itself is something to be endured rather than enjoyed.</p> <p>I am astonished that Arnold Wesker’s <strong>The Wedding Feast</strong> is virtually unknown. It premiered in Sweden in 1974, had British productions in Leeds and Birmingham in 1977 and 1980 – the latter with David Suchet – and has since disappeared. Based on a Dostoevsky short story, it is one of Wesker’s finest works and, not unlike Steel’s play, raises big issues about class and race. It’s the story of a rich Jewish shoe manufacturer who drops in uninvited on the wedding of one of his workers: a decision that leads to social embarrassment and personal humiliation. No one gains from the experience. The boss sees the limits of his capitalist paternalism, the wedding guests reveal their boozy boorishness and the married couple confront a joyless future.</p> <p>If Wesker’s play raises social and political issues, Lorca’s <strong>Blood Wedding</strong> (1933) reminds us of the power of ancestral hatreds. This brooding, brilliant piece of poetic realism shows a bride being abducted, at the height of the marriage ceremony, by a former lover with whom the groom’s family have a bitter feud. Part of what makes the play so gripping is Lorca’s ability to contrast the celebratory wedding-feast songs and dances with the emotional chill of the bridal couple. Reviewing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/may/13/theatre\">Rufus Norris’s inventive Almeida production</a> in 2005, I found myself wondering whether the play defied translation. One answer same in 2019 when the Young Vic staged a version by Marina Carr that successfully transposed the action to Ireland.</p>    <p>But, whatever Lorca and Wesker suggest, it is possible to write a genuinely funny, farcical play about a wedding that leaves us all laughing. Perhaps surprisingly, the dramatist who did it was Bertolt Brecht in <strong>A Respectable Wedding</strong> (1926) which was revived by Joe Hill-Gibbins at the Young Vic in 2007 in a translation by Rory Bremner with James Corden as the best friend who enlivens the ceremony by reading out smutty poems. Brecht’s target was bourgeois propriety but his method owed more to Groucho than to Karl Marx. The bride is three months pregnant, the guests behave outrageously and the groom’s do-it-yourself furniture-making reaches a hilarious climax when the marriage bed noisily collapses.</p> <p>Comedy of a more sophisticated kind appears in Ben Jonson’s <strong>Epicœne or The Silent Woman</strong> (1609). Apart from a Danny Boyle revival with David Bradley at the Swan in Stratford upon Avon in 1989, the play has been little done. Morose, the misanthropic hero, so detests the meaningless clatter of social life that he seeks a silent bride. One is eventually found but Morose is tormented first by a raucous wedding feast and then by the discovery – spoiler alert – that his bride is a boy in disguise.</p>    <p>If you want a really good example of a wedding that goes wrong, however, you have only to turn to Shakespeare and <strong>Much Ado About Nothing</strong> (1598). Mistakenly believing Hero to have engaged in pre-marital sex, Claudio famously spurns her at the altar saying: “Give not this rotten orange to your friend.” What I find extraordinary is the intemperate reaction of her father, Leonato, who says that, if he didn’t think Hero would quickly die, “myself would … strike at thy life”. The situation may eventually be resolved but in the words of Benedick: “This looks not like a nuptial.”</p> <p>But few theatrical weddings go as planned, whether it be Peer Gynt running off with the bride or Petruchio turning up rudely apparelled and with a horse “possessed in the glanders and like to mose in the chine”: in other words, badly diseased. A day of celebration is invariably touched with disaster. It is not, I suggest, because most dramatists are downright cynics but because they are supreme ironists who see that the social rituals we create disguise the ugly realities beneath. Even if your marriage is made in heaven the wedding day itself is often hell.</p> <ul> <li><p>A Mirror is at the <a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/a-mirror-west-end/\">Trafalgar theatre, London</a>, 22 January–20 April.

            "body" : "<p>The line between super-heroism and super-villainy is in the eye of the beholder. Not everyone would agree with the moral imperatives of a masked billionaire tackling street crime (Batman), a Holocaust survivor fighting for equal rights (Magneto) or an alien committed to “truth, justice and the American way” (Superman). So, while Echo (Alaqua Cox) was a villain in 2021’s Hawkeye, her transition from antagonist to protagonist is wholly persuasive, particularly since dead family member(s) are the core motive in these hero/villain origin stories.</p> <p>Hawkeye, based around Jeremy Renner’s bow-wielding vigilante, surpassed (admittedly rock bottom) expectations with a fun, self-contained story that saw everyone’s least favourite Avenger battle Kingpin and make it home in time for Christmas. It was the fifth of the 12 Disney+ Marvel series, but it seemed born of a golden age when WandaVision and Loki debuted with some genuine sparks of ingenuity, and before the talents of Oscar Isaac, Olivia Colman and Tatiana Maslany had been publicly squandered. While Echo doesn’t quite cure the pandemic of Marvel fatigue currently raging across the globe, it shows there may be some life in the old gal.</p> <p>The series follows Echo, AKA Maya Lopez, after the events of Hawkeye, where she battles her ruthless quasi-uncle Kingpin, AKA Wilson Fisk’s, army after shooting him point blank in the face. But to establish her as the piece’s hero and not Hawkeye’s villain, we start with an episode dedicated to her story. We meet seven-year-old Choctaw girl Maya growing up in Omaha when a tragedy befalls her family, leading her and her father to move to New York where, over the decades, he ascends the ranks of “the Tracksuit Mafia” (no, that name is not a joke and yes, they do all wear tracksuits), before Hawkeye kills him in events it transpires were set up by Kingpin himself. But before the truth comes out, the young, deaf amputee is manipulated by Kingpin into taking her father’s place and becomes his chief muscle, fuelled by vengeance and helped by her ability to “echo” the fighting skills of her opponents, making her a worthy adversary to all who cross her path.</p> <p>Beyond being well-trained by her beloved father, Echo can tap into the strength of her Choctaw ancestors. As her grandfather Skully (Graham Greene) drops in with a convenient bit of exposition, she is a direct descendent of “the first Choctaw, who saved everyone from the cave. When they emerged, they turned into human beings.” This Choctaw origin story is shown in the show’s opening moments, but its relevance is only made explicit when the battles heat up and Maya taps into forces greater than herself. Skully explains that “Shafa and the ancestors would watch out for the family in times of need, but they are tricky. You never know when they might come calling.” Aside from the initial cave rescue, each of the three episodes provided for review commences with an act of heroism from Maya’s matrilineal line, paralleling the present day, where Maya must protect her fellow Choctaw from bullets, blades and awkward family reunions.</p>    <p>The show is significantly gnarlier than its Disney+ predecessors, with far bloodier violence than has graced the streamer before. Episode one contains one of the best action scenes across the entire multiverse, with a four-minute long single take of a deal gone wrong in a warehouse, resulting in a cacophony of exploding skulls and snapping necks. Even more impressive is the central performance from Cox, who shares being Native American (in her case Menominee and Mohican), deaf and an amputee with the character and can emote complex, conflicted emotions mid-upper-cut. The supporting cast has plenty of highlights, too. Zahn McClarnon is heartbreaking as a man crushed by grief but devoted to protecting his young daughter, Greene brings the deadpan comedy, growling at problematic white tourists who frequent his artisanal Native American store that they should go to Anthropologie, and Tantoo Cardinal is sensational as her stubborn estranged grandmother, poisoned by decades of resentment.</p> <p>But the show isn’t immune to the broad malaise that infects the MCU, namely the need to continually build an interconnected universe. As much as the show wants to carve out its own identity, it still feels like there’s a PhD level of research expected of viewers to follow Echo’s story properly. In just the three years since the Disney+ Marvel TV series kicked off with WandaVision, the format has accumulated a stunning amount of baggage, and it’s hard to imagine any show being able to debut with the self-contained flights of fancy of its earliest outings. Echo may be far more impressive than anything to come out of the recent multiverse. Sadly, though, she is still forced to mirror the mistakes of her Marvel forebears.</p> <p><em>• </em>Echo is on Disney+ now</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) has called on Michael Gove to accelerate a promised crackdown on landlords failing to fix tens of thousands of mouldy homes with a warning that unless laws are toughened many more people will die from the effects.</p> \n<p>As the housing ombudsman reported increasing failures among landlords to properly tackle damp, mould and leaks in England’s social housing, Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, special adviser on air quality to the RCP, warned of widening ill-health as more people inhale fungal toxins.</p> \n<p>He said consequences include people suffering headaches, low energy, declining immunity and increased susceptibility among children to respiratory infections as well as deaths.</p> \n<p>Prof Holgate said increased flooding, more householders keeping windows tightly shut to save energy and fungus becoming increasingly resilient to treatment – in homes as well as in the human body – as a result of widespread use of fungicides in farming, made reform more urgent.</p> \n<p>In the nine months since March, the housing ombudsman for England, Richard Blakeway, made 721 findings of fault in how landlords tackled damp, mould and leaks, more than for the previous 12 months and several times more than in 2020-21. About 88,000 households in social housing are believed by the regulator of social housing to be living with serious damp and mould problems.</p> \n<p>Last year, Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-deliver-awaabs-law\">promised to introduce Awaab’s law</a> setting tough deadlines for landlords to fix mouldy homes, after two-year-old Awaab Ishak died from prolonged exposure to black mould in his family’s Rochdale social housing flat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"50d1c378-8bb6-46a7-869b-f933616e9d1f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AIro0PmrIk8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The government is saying only that it will deliver the promise “as soon as practically possible”. Holgate said the vital reform was being held up by “obfuscation, debate and committees” and said there should be a “zero tolerance” approach to mould, as was the case in Germany.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Gove announced an eight-week consultation on proposals to require social landlords to investigate hazards within 14 days, start fixing problems within a further seven days, and make emergency repairs within 24 hours, or pay compensation to tenants. It remains unclear, however, when any new law would come into effect.</p> \n<p>The National Housing Federation, which represents social landlords, said it supported timescales for dealing with mould and damp “where appropriate”.</p> \n<p>“Why haven’t we got it in place?” said Prof Holgate. “We know this is an ongoing problem. We know housing in this country is in a dreadful state … The science of [the risks of mould exposure] hasn’t been accepted strongly enough by the regulators. This passive approach is failing society.”</p> \n<p>He said people in rooms that smelled strongly of mould were likely to be inhaling mycotoxins that can create non-specific ill-health such as headaches, as well as acute lung illnesses.</p> \n<p>Announcing the consultation on Awaab’s law, Gove said he was taking “stronger and more robust action against social landlords who have refused to take their basic responsibilities seriously for far too long”.</p> \n<p>Awaab’s family, who have warned tenants in mouldy flats to simply “get out” after his death in December 2020, said they supported the proposed new law and hoped it “will stop any other family going through the pain that we went through”.</p> \n<p>The Nottinghamshire coroner last month warned of “a risk that future deaths could occur” after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/dec/20/uk-council-tenants-death-could-have-been-due-to-mouldly-home-doctors-say\">council tenant Jane Bennett, 52, died last year from respiratory failure</a> that may have been caused by exposure to untreated mould in her home.</p> \n<p>Now a single mother living in a mouldy council flat in Lewisham has told the Guardian she is considering putting her six-year-old son into care after he was diagnosed with breathing difficulties. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/22/residents-rise-up-against-damp-homes-in-little-london-rotherham\">Residents rise up against damp homes in Little London, Rotherham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Monday, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, appeared to take things into his own hands in announcing a good landlord charter for his area that would set standards and timetables for repairs, based on the principle that “people’s homes should not damage their physical or psychological health”.</p> \n<p>Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, also said it was vital that landlords tackled mould “as soon as possible, to avoid the risk of a serious health impact”.</p> \n<p>“Having significant damp and mould in a home can have a serious impact on a person’s health – especially if that person has an existing condition such as asthma or is in a high-risk group for respiratory infection,” she said.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>When someone you love takes their own life, guilt is unavoidable; when they hold you responsible, guilt is off the scale. The sister of Canadian novelist Martha Baillie, Christina, killed herself at 61. On the wall, in blue marker, she’d written three reasons for wanting to die: “Because of schizophrenia / Because of The Juniper Tree / Because of losing the house”. The schizophrenia went a long way back; she’d first attempted suicide in her 20s. By “The Juniper Tree” she meant a Brothers Grimm fairytale in which a child is killed by one parent and fed in a stew to the other, much as Christina felt she had been, believing herself to be a victim of domestic abuse. But it was the third reason that weighed on Martha, who’d been the one keen to sell the family house in Toronto, despite Christina telling her, in front of a psychiatrist: “If I’m forced to leave the house as soon as Mom dies, you’ll just find a body.”</p> <p>The book is a trilogy of essays about an ordinarily dysfunctional middle-class family, “a dog chasing its own tail”. Death is its starting point and the source of its best aphorisms. “Were life a cartoon, being punched by the death of a person you love would make you see stars,” she writes; it’s “the sweeping tug of a train entering a station, attempting to draw everyone from the platform”. The first essay recounts the death of her mother, an artist, at the age of 99; the second looks back on the life of her father, a mathematics professor, who was “rescued from loneliness” when he married at 41. Martha remembers both parents fondly, recalling how her mother professed “I love you always” and presenting her father as a kindly man devoted to trees and animal welfare. But in the long third essay Christina’s suicide drives her back to childhood to reassess them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Baillie knows she’ll never find out why a shared childhood should have had such different outcomes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“<em>Familiar</em> is a word I allow,” Christina wrote in her journal (only parts of which Martha can bear to read), “<em>Family </em>is not.” At three, her mother stabbed her in the eye with a needle – or so Christina believes, convinced that the operation she had for a wandering eye was merely a cover. To Martha the stabbing seems unlikely. She felt the less favoured of the two children: the daughter their mother indulged and most wanted to please was Christina, “in whom she saw herself”. She’s bemused at how their upbringing could have made her sister think that their parents belonged to a circle of Nazi paedophiles. But she’s patient, as the mediator, when Christina scorns and refuses to speak to their mother. And she pushes herself to the borders of psychobabble in her efforts to understand (“That Christina felt stabbed in the <em>I</em> makes sense to me”).</p> <p>With her father, it’s harder: could he really have molested Christina? A school janitor made a pass at her when she was 13 and it seems she projected that offence on to her Dad. He certainly spanked her when she defied him, taking her over his knee. But he spanked Martha too and so did their mother – to them it was standard childrearing practice. More culpable was his animosity towards the teenage Christina: they’d argue and she’d get the better of him but, as a “poor loser” who felt disrespected, he’d nag and find fault, failing to allow for her fragility.</p> <p>She was certainly fragile. “If only I hadn’t fallen in love with death when I was so young,” she wrote in a journal. She cut herself with his razors and with broken bottles. She developed anorexia, was diagnosed with PTSD, had hallucinations and suspected she was on the autism spectrum. Though in love with a woman, she married N, a painter, and while his career took off her ambitions as a writer dwindled; for relief she took to collecting antique dolls and would sometimes speak in “their” voices. In returning from Victoria to Toronto, after the marriage ended, she hoped to be freer to express her lesbianism. But as her fear of people increased, the only relationships seem to have been with her sister, mother and psychiatrist, Dr R. Off medication, against Dr R’s wishes, Christina became more erratic. She turned up at the library where Martha worked in different guises, a bearded old man one day, a skinny British woman another.</p> <p>Martha owns up to childhood rivalry with her sister and to a battle of wills about selling the house. But she also looked after Christina, checking in on her, organising repairs and collaborating with her on a book. Christina’s writing, extensively quoted, verges on the indecipherable, blurring the line between animate and inanimate, but Martha untangles and defends it: “In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesjoyce\">James Joyce</a>’s Finnegans Wake she could relax.” She knows she’ll never find out why a shared childhood should have had such different outcomes; the only truth she arrives at will be variable and of her own making. Still, the “disobedient tale” she tells is tough, tender and compelling.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on 116 123 and the <a href=\"https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\">domestic abuse helpline</a> is 0808 2000 247.

This is the championship for nations in the Caribbean Football Union, a subgroup of Concacaf. At club level, he won the Uefa Intertoto Cup with Karlsruher SC in 1996. It’s not the most prestigious competition. Still, he won continental cups on three different continents and was runner-up in a fourth.”</p> <p>Marc Harrison has taken an even deeper dive into this question. “<strong>Ange Postecoglou</strong> has tasted international success on two continents, although his first titles came at youth level. He coached the young Socceroos to six OFC championships, three at U17 and three at U20, before leading the men’s senior team to Asian Cup glory on home soil in 2015. Several managers have an Arabian Gulf Cup, a regional tournament dating back to 1970, alongside a continental trophy. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/08/mario-zagallo-the-vain-strategist-who-created-the-model-of-modern-football\">Mário Zagallo</a></strong> (1976, Copa América), <strong>Claude </strong><strong>Le Roy</strong> (2009, Afcon 1988), <strong>Djamel Belmadi</strong> (2014, plus Afcon 2019).”</p> <p>Finally, as Marc points out, Mancini isn’t the only manager looking for his second continental championship. “South Korea’s <strong>Jürgen Klinsmann</strong> will be looking to add Asian Cup success to his 2013 Concacaf Gold Cup triumph [with the USA], while Bahrain’s Juan Antonio Pizzi will be looking to repeat Chile’s 2016 Copa América win.”</p> <h2><strong>Quickest revenge/returning hero hat-trick</strong></h2> <p><strong>“Chris Wood scored a hat-trick at St James’ Park just under a year after being sold by Newcastle to Nottingham Forest. What’s the shortest period of time in which a former a player has returned to their former club and scored a hat-trick?” </strong>wonders Masai Graham.</p> <p>When Chris Wood scored <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/26/newcastle-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">an outstanding hat-trick against</a> his old club on Boxing Day, he was a model of restraint after each goal. A couple of years ago, another Chris adopted a less dignified approach.</p> <p>“<strong>Chris Maguire</strong> left Sunderland on 30 June 2021 when his contract expired,” writes Phil Boyle. “On 11 January 2022 he scored a hat-trick for Lincoln at the Stadium of Light, <a href=\"https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/12513920/lincoln-striker-celebrates-in-ex-managers-face\">celebrating the third in the face of then-Sunderland manager Lee Johnson</a>, who was later sent off.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38-aOv_MWXg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/38-aOv_MWXg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Maguire scored more goals in one match against Sunderland than he did in his other 38 games for Lincoln. He has since moved on, though at least the Lincoln manager doesn’t have to worry about revenge: Maguire is now at Eastleigh in the National League.</p> <p><strong>Josh King</strong> probably wasn’t quite as intent on revenge when he returned to Goodison Park in October 2021, but he did bite the hand that once fed him even more quickly than Maguire.</p> <p>“King left Everton following an unsuccessful loan spell at the end of the 2020-21 season,” writes Dan Kelly. “He returned to Goodison four-and-a-half months later with Watford and scored a hat-trick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/23/everton-watford-premier-league-match-report\">in a 5-2 victory</a>.

            "body" : "<p>I am in awe of Wael Dahdouh’s strength to haul himself back in front of the camera and focus on the suffering of others even as he has repeatedly endured his own personal hell. The face of Al Jazeera’s reporting throughout Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza was on air in October when he learned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/25/al-jazeera-journalist-family-killed-wael-al-dahdouh\">his wife, seven-year-old daughter, 15-year-old son and one-year-old grandson were killed</a> in an attack. Still he went on reporting.</p> <p>Last month, Dahdouh himself was wounded and his cameraman, Samer Abu Daqqa, killed in the Israeli bombing of<strong> </strong>a UN-run school used as a shelter. Then on Sunday, an Israeli drone strike on a car in southern Gaza <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/hamza-son-of-al-jazeeras-wael-dahdouh-killed-in-israeli-attack-in-gaza\">killed Dahdouh’s eldest son</a>, 27-year-old Hamza, who also worked for Al Jazeera, along with another journalist.</p> <p>Dahdouh took a break from reporting to attend the funeral of his son and then returned to the airwaves. “Nothing is harder than the pain of loss, and when you experience this pain time after time, it becomes harder and more severe,” he told Al Jazeera. “I wish that the blood of my son Hamza will be the last from journalists and the last from people here in Gaza, and for this massacre to stop.”</p> <p>Hamza and his colleague, Mustafa Thuraya, a videographer for Agence France Press, were the latest of scores of journalists killed by Israel in its assault on Gaza in response to the Hamas cross-border attack in October. Israel says it does not target journalists but that is hard to square with the fact that its military aimed two missiles directly at the car carrying Hamza. The Israel Defense Forces, which has a track record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/26/shireen-abu-akleh-us-senators-israel\">false claims</a> about the circumstances in which it has killed journalists, initially said that there was a “terrorist” with a camera drone in the vehicle. But the reporters were not flying the drone when the car was struck and it is difficult to believe that, if the military was following the journalists’ actions, it did not recognise them as media workers.</p> <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2024/01/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/\">calculates that</a> Israel has killed more than 70 media workers in the latest war in Gaza, making it the deadliest conflict for journalists in decades. Others put <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/gaza-media-office-says-100-journalists-killed-since-israeli-attacks-began\">the toll at more than 100</a>.</p> <p>The CPJ says that the scale and circumstances of the killings, including direct threats to reporters and their families by Israeli officials, is evidence that Palestinian reporters in Gaza are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/israel-idf-accused-targeting-journalists-gaza\">being targeted</a>. Murdered, in other words. If so, it’s a war crime and, as Al Jazeera has demanded, the international criminal court should add these killings to its <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-kc-cairo-situation-state-palestine-and-israel\">investigation of Israel’s other alleged breaches</a> of the Geneva conventions across occupied Palestine.</p> <p>Journalists accept there are inherent dangers in reporting conflicts, whether they choose to go to the war as correspondents for foreign news organisations, or the war comes to them and their families against their wishes, as for Dahdouh. Colleagues I knew personally – some friends, others more professional acquaintances – have lost their lives doing their jobs as journalists. From David Blundy, shot by a sniper on a street in El Salvador in 1989, to Marie Colvin, killed by shelling in Syria in 2012. Others died in South African townships, on the streets of Somalia, in fighting during the Libyan revolution, or were gunned down by rebels in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Each reporter calculates the risks, and whether they are worth taking. Is it safe to go down that road? The answer might not be what immediately seems obvious. Generally it was safer to approach a militia roadblock during the Rwandan genocide than those manned by rebels in Liberia or Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Even reporting from Gaza during the second intifada 20 years ago, when the Israeli military regularly invaded, bombed and flattened Palestinian neighbourhoods, did not feel especially unsafe compared with other regions. Not that the Israeli army was above killing people it knew to be journalists.</p> <p>In 2003, an Israeli soldier shot dead the British documentary cameraman James Miller in Gaza. An inquest in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/07/israel\">returned a verdict of unlawful killing</a>. Israel declined to prosecute the soldier responsible but it did pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/02/israel-cameraman-gaza-victim\">£1.5m in compensation</a>, which Miller’s family said was “probably the closest we’ll get to an admission of guilt on the part of the Israelis”.</p> <p>Miller’s killing looked to be part of a pattern of ill-disciplined Israeli soldiers shooting whoever they felt like – not only journalists but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/07/israel\">UN officials</a> and aid workers as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/28/comment.israelandthepalestinians\">Palestinian children</a>. The army was usually quick to try to cover up the killings but it did not appear they were coordinated.</p> <p>Gaza looks very different today. As the CPJ and the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders say, the scale and nature of the deaths of journalists and their families suggests there is more going on than a few ill-disciplined soldiers taking pot shots at reporters, even taking into account the deaths of thousands of other Palestinians, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/21/gaza-children-being-killed-or-mutilated-in-very-extreme-numbers-australian-doctor-says\">more than 8,000 children</a>.</p> <p>Certainly the message from some Israeli leaders is that journalists are fair game. Israeli politicians were quick to call for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannydanon/status/1722586229709922365?t=t8CDCDMhpUTHIqDkHtDp8Q&amp;s=19\">the “elimination”</a> of a number of Palestinian journalists working for foreign news organisations who were falsely accused by a pro-Israel pressure group in the US of being “embedded with Hamas” on 7 October. Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, said they <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-strikes-kill-family-members-journalist-targeted-by-death-threats-2023-11-20/\">should be hunted down as terrorists</a>, reflecting a widely held suspicion among Israeli officials that Palestinian journalists are an appendage of Hamas.</p> <p>Miller’s family got a payout because he was British. Dead western journalists create more waves, which is presumably one of the reasons Israel has locked the foreign press out of Gaza during the present war. International news organisations now rely on those same Palestinian reporters targeted by Israel. They provide many of the pictures the rest of the world sees of the horror in Gaza.</p> <p>It is therefore troubling that while western newspapers and television stations have reported the rising numbers of deaths of journalists in Gaza, many news organisations appear unwilling to directly address the pattern of killing that, as the CPJ’s evidence appears to show, provides strong evidence of a war crime. It would surely be different if American or European reporters were the ones dying.</p> <ul> <li><p>Chris McGreal writes for Guardian US and is a former Guardian correspondent in Washington, Johannesburg and Jerusalem</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The last time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid\">Real Madrid</a> met their city rivals, they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/sep/24/atletico-madrid-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">defeated at the Metropolitano</a>, a 10-minute drive from Valdebebas where they work daily. When they meet in just eight days, it will be there too. But on Wednesday they will meet 4,963km away in Riyadh– the first of three matches, in three competitions, in three weeks.</p> <p>Like Turkey, Spain’s Super Cup is being played in Saudi Arabia. There won’t be many Spanish fans there but, unlike Turkey’s, it will go ahead. On Thursday night, Barcelona face Osasuna in the second semi-final but the four-team competition, among the first of the catalogue of sporting events sold to the state, when the former Federation president Luis Rubiales and then Barcelona player Gerard Piqué took it there in 2019, opens with a Madrid derby on Wednesday. That will be followed the week after by the Copa del Rey last 16, back in Madrid, and then the league meeting at the Santiago Bernabéu on 4 February.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/06/girona-atletico-madrid-la-liga\">Girona’s wild and wonderful win over Atlético shows title tilt is no fluke | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By then Ancelotti will have faced Diego Simeone, neighbours in La Finca on the western edge of Madrid, as many times as any other coach in his 32-year career: that league fixture will be the 24th game they have come across each other from their technical areas. They have also encountered each other twice as players, and on the evening before this Super Cup semi-final the Italian recalled a meeting in April 2000 when Simeone, then a midfielder at Lazio, scored the only goal in a victory against Juventus, who he was managing.</p> <p>“We have spoken lots of times, we know each other because we have played each other a lot. We live close by, and sometimes we see each other. Always with a lot of respect,” Ancelotti said. “I feel good in this ‘white’ atmosphere [at Madrid] and, as an observer, I think Simeone feels good in the Atlético atmosphere. He has the ideal profile for them: if not, you don’t last all that time at one club.” Much the same could be said of him: with Brazil determined to see him take them into a World Cup, Ancelotti <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/29/carlo-ancelotti-extends-contract-with-real-madrid-until-2026\">recently signed</a> a new contract at the Santiago Bernabéu. That he did so mid-season is almost unheard of.</p> <p>In their managerial meetings so far, they have won eight each. This is not their biggest game: they led their sides to the first European Cup final between clubs from the same city, for a start. And as this run of three derbies in as many weeks begins, an inevitable debate has been raised: which matters most?</p> <p>Super Cup, Copa del Rey, then league: on the face of it each is a little bigger than the last, each new meeting built upon the previous one. Yet while Atlético defeated Real in the first meeting this season, that has proven the catalyst for change, which helps to alter things. “That game did us a lot of damage, [but] it seems we have fixed that and I think tomorrow we can be a better version [of ourselves],” Ancelotti said. Madrid have since restructured the midfield, moved Jude Bellingham to the left, found greater defensive security and are undefeated.</p>    <p>Atlético meanwhile are different, too: they have scored more goals but the defensive solidity that used to define them has been absent, they have lost each of their past four away games and slipped 10 points behind in the league – enough to suggest that February’s meeting may be of little relevance, the title long since escaping their grasp.</p> <p>Given a choice of the Copa del Rey and the Super Cup, the answer would appear obvious too but, while the move to Saudi Arabia has removed some of the soul and most of the supporters, this competition was always more than the Community Shield and the creation of a final-four format has made it feel bigger. It is a semi-final too, a short route to silverware. A cup victory, by contrast, would still leave them three games from the final. Besides, you can’t choose and as Simeone always says, to the point of parody: <em>partido a partido</em>, one game at a time. And the next game is a derby, which is never just a game, even so far from home.</p> <p>Atlético remember the last time they met in Saudi Arabia: a late, professional foul by Fede Valverde on Álvaro Morata denied them in the 2020 final and made him immensely popular among his supporters. “I don’t know if that put me in the hearts of Madrid fans but I am not proud of it,” the Uruguayan said at the time. “I would do it again for sure,” he said before this derby. “It was very close and it was decisive, so if it was the same I would do it again – for my team, the values I grew up with. It’s not about that moment, it’s that it was my first Super Cup.</p> <p>“There are people who think you have to play [this] in Spain, but we have to compete, to win, make people happy. It’s nice to compete against the best and Atlético is one of the best, not just in Spain but in Europe. The cup will be very important and the league too [but] this is another title, another derby, and it’s a lovely game to enjoy.”</p> <p>As Ancelotti said: “Atlético are our rival: always have been, always will be. Personally, it’s not that I particularly like coming across Atlético Madrid because they’re one of the best but we have to play them and they will feel the same way. We’re two very strong teams, and it will be hard.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Ministers decided to prioritise driving over active travel because of worries among ministers about “15-minute cities”, documents seen by the Guardian show.</p> <p>They indicate that a significant shift in transport policy was guided at least in part by conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Ministers began considering curbs on cycling and walking schemes in March last year, one document said, “in response to concerns about 15-minute cities”, an urban planning concept that Rishi Sunak’s government has repeatedly mischaracterised.</p> <p>Other policy papers, uncovered as part of a legal challenge by the Transport Action Network (TAN), show officials warned ministers that a parallel crackdown on low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) was likely to be legally “challenging”.</p> <p>Another document advised ministers they should drop plans to improve active travel “quietly”, adding: “We would not propose to make any public announcement to this effect.”</p> <p>Devised by the France-based urbanist, Carlos Moreno, 15-minute cities are a broad planning concept based on people living within easy reach of workplaces and schools, as well as local amenities, gradually reducing the need for short car trips.</p> <p>The idea caught the attention of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2023/oct/07/15-minute-cities-rishi-sunak-tories-conspiracy-theory\"> a range of conspiracy theorists</a>, who see it as a supposed part of a “great reset” or “climate lockdown” in which people are forcibly kept within their local neighbourhood and not allowed to travel.</p> <p>In his speech to the Conservative conference in October, Mark Harper, the transport secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/04/15-minute-cities-to-bananas-why-tories-seem-to-be-bending-the-truth\">described 15-minutes cities</a> as schemes in which “local councils can decide how often you go to the shops”, which was incorrect and is something that has never been proposed in the UK.</p> <p>While many critics assumed at the time this was just rhetoric, the documents indicate Harper and the Department for Transport (DfT) used this definition as the basis for one of the biggest shifts in transport policy for decades.</p> <p>In September, Sunak ended years of policies aimed to promote walking and cycling with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/29/rishi-sunak-plan-for-motorists-would-limit-travel-choices-campaigners-say\">his plan for drivers</a>, which promised to crack down on “anti-car measures” like 20mph speed limits and LTNs, which seek to limit through-traffic on residential streets.</p> <p>The document from March proposes removing pro-active travel measures introduced during Covid because of worries about 15-minute cities.</p> <p>It is understood that officials were referring to plans to extend LTN-type schemes to wider areas, such as one due to begin in Oxford next year. This has been widely confused with separate 15-minute city ideas.</p> <p>Moreno has previously written to Sunak to warn that misinformation has led to him and his family receiving death threats. He told the Guardian that the UK government’s notion of 15-minute cities “appears to be used to stir up fear and opposition, particularly leveraging the idea that the use of individual cars is a fundamental freedom right”.</p> <p>TAN, which is being assisted by Dale Vince, the green energy magnate and campaigner, has sought a judicial review of the decision to scrap government guidance to councils introduced during Covid to help more people walk and cycle.</p> <p>The group’s director, Chris Todd, said: “These shocking revelations show Rishi Sunak was more concerned with crazy conspiracy theories than helping people travel safely and cheaply. It’s absurd for ministers to be swept away by hysteria about 15-minute cities, at the same time that other government departments were defending them.”</p> <p>The DfT documents also show that officials repeatedly warned ministers that other aspects of the plan for motorists, notably the idea of potentially forcing councils to remove LTNs, were unlikely to succeed.</p> <p>While a number were introduced during Covid, the wider idea of LTNs – using bollards or other barriers to block through motor traffic on smaller urban roads without impeding cyclists or pedestrians – has been used for decades.</p> <p>A DfT briefing paper for Downing Street in August warned that a full review of existing LTNs “could entail a very large piece of analytical work”, adding that “there is an expectation among media” that the plan for motorists would nonetheless target them.</p> <p>The DfT said it could not comment on ongoing legal action. A spokesperson said: “It is important that people who choose to walk and cycle can do so safely, but this should not come at the cost of people who rely on cars or prevent the emergency services from accessing roads.</p> <p>“Our plan for drivers backs the majority of the public who drive and will review guidance on over-zealous traffic schemes that impinge on people’s freedoms, such as low traffic neighbourhoods, to ensure there is strong local support.”</p> <h2>What is a 15-minute city?</h2> <p>The idea of a 15-minute city is relatively new – first outlined in 2016 by Carlos Moreno of Pantheon-Sorbonne university in Paris – and none has arguably been created yet. But it is a concept that has gained significant prominence – much of it under false pretences.</p> <p>At its heart, this is an urbanism concept, a framework rather than a specific plan: trying to gradually change cities so people tend to live relatively close to shops, workplaces and other amenities. With this comes an inevitable shift from car trips to walking, cycling and public transport.</p> <p>However, the adoption of the idea, even as a long-term aspiration, by cities as varied as Paris, Bogotá and Oxford has prompted a wave of conspiracies about a supposed transnational plot to block people from travelling beyond their local neighbourhood.</p> <p>There is zero evidence for this, and even when traffic schemes do exist, such as <a href=\"https://www.oxford.gov.uk/news/article/2332/joint_statement_from_oxfordshire_county_council_and_oxford_city_council_on_oxford_s_traffic_filters\">Oxford’s ambitious plan</a> to install filters on six roads to discourage short car trips on residential streets, they are not 15-minute cities, or even described as such.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>On the back of his short-story collections, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/young-skins-9780099597421\">Young Skins</a> and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/homesickness-9781529115703\">Homesickness</a>, Colin Barrett was lauded by the Oprah Daily website as “<a href=\"https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/books/g42038434/our-favorite-books-of-the-year/\">a&nbsp;doyen of the sentence</a>”. As accolades go, this has the dubious merit of being simultaneously embarrassing and accurate: a ludicrous phrase sullying a fair designation. Fair, because when reading Barrett, one is immediately struck by a sensation best described as relief: the realisation that one is in safe hands here; this is a writer of glaringly obvious talent, operating at a seriously high level. In Wild Houses we see for the first time Barrett’s evident abilities playing themselves out across the wider horizons of the novel form.</p> <p>Readers familiar with Barrett’s work will immediately recognise the world of Wild Houses. Small-time County Mayo crooks Gabe and Sketch abduct Doll English, the younger brother of a local lad who owes them a few grand in drug debts. They all hole up for the weekend with Dev, a troubled and introverted soul whose remote farmhouse doubles as a convenient location to keep a hostage. From here we follow Doll’s girlfriend Nicky as&nbsp;she attempts to uncover what has happened and to bring Doll back home unharmed. In essence, the novel is a caper, the heaviness of the criminality undercut by&nbsp;bungles and incompetence. On the face of it the story&nbsp;is slight, but what elevates Wild Houses is the deftness of its telling. Barrett leans heavily on a type of proleptic plotting, flashing forward to points of crisis&nbsp;and then rolling the clock back to allow the reader to discover how things ended up that way. A genre convention most commonly used in thrillers, it’s executed here with an impressive lightness of touch.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Barrett’s dialogue is so witty and inventive one struggles to think of recent novels that could stand up to comparison</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wild Houses is a novel of rootedness, in every sense of the word. Characters are rooted to the spot, trapped and immobile; they are rooted in place, embedded and&nbsp;overfamiliar; they are rooted together, knotted and interconnected; and, in the final reckoning, they are rooted out, left uncovered and exposed. Barrett is&nbsp;superb in this space, capturing brilliantly the claustrophobia and repetitiveness of growing up in an&nbsp;area where everybody knows your name and has something to say about your business. The impact is accretive: the same people, the same conversations, the sense of lives lived on a loop, of needing to exert extraordinary will in order to achieve escape velocity. Barrett is a skilful enough writer that this is rendered without sentimentality; instead, we see the rhythms and recurrences of hard lives inscribed in the physicality&nbsp;of those forced to live them, a prematurely aged face “like a vandalised church”, eyes “glinting deep in their sockets like smashed out windows”. The&nbsp;novel is studded with such striking descriptions. While 99% of writers try to find new ways of describing the way light can blind you, Barrett tells us it was “blindingly dark”, a phrase at once so commonsense and so unusual that it caused me to double take.</p> <p>Wild Houses is a book that critics and readers will inevitably end up praising on “a sentence level”. The fact that Barrett is so often hailed specifically for his mastery of the sentence is worth dwelling on. More often than not, when people commend a writer on these terms, they mean they have identified a particular type of sensibility at work. One thinks of James Baldwin’s goal “to write a sentence as clean as a bone”, George Orwell’s fetish for the “unadorned and invisible” or the tendency to praise prose for being “taut”, “lean”, “muscular” or “spare”. Leaving aside the ways this critical vocabulary might be rooted in our&nbsp;prejudices surrounding certain types of body –&nbsp;god&nbsp;forbid a sentence be “flabby” – one thing is clear:&nbsp;contemporary literary eulogies centre around control and restraint.</p> <p>That may be reasonable enough, but its utter ubiquity&nbsp;can sometimes leave one longing for a counterweight; sentences that fail audaciously, a bit of&nbsp;bombast, a distrust of polite minimalism. And if Wild&nbsp;Houses has a flaw, then it is to be found here. With&nbsp;Barrett it is all precision and precious little release.&nbsp;His is the type of brilliance that can occasionally veer into the territory of the virtuosic, the relentless and the clinical. When working in the short-story form, this is an unalloyed asset, but across the course of a whole novel, it can begin to feel a little airless.</p> <p>What ultimately prevents this from dragging the novel down is Barrett’s handling of dialogue, which is so consistently witty and inventive that one struggles to think of recent novels that could stand up to comparison. When Doll’s mother complains in the car that “That’s how I know there’s a migraine in the post. The aura comes over me,” Doll replies, with “more unsolicited tuppencing from the back”, that there is “an awful mystical bent to mother’s suffering these days”. Exchanges like this – droll, linguistically inventive, poignant – are emblematic of Wild Houses, a novel which proves that, in the right hands, fine lines can fill a canvas as effectively as the boldest of brushstrokes.</p> <p>• Wild Houses by Colin Barrett is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

            "body" : "<p>I had a strange kind of premonition, even before my dad spoke on that day in 2016, that something was very wrong. He said my sister Katie had been in a serious car accident, and that I needed to get to the hospital quickly. She had been airlifted to hospital in Plymouth. I went there to join our parents and my other sister, Meg. It became apparent very quickly just how bad it was. Katie, 21, had suffered head and abdominal injuries and it wasn’t clear that she would survive the first night. She was in intensive care for two weeks – and then the tube that was feeding her ruptured and she went into cardiac arrest.</p> <p>It happened at night, and again, I got a call saying I needed to get to the hospital quickly. I was 23, a confident young man with a bit of an ego, but there in the waiting room, I had my first ever panic attack. We were called into a room and told she probably wasn’t going to make it, and to say our goodbyes. But again, she pulled through.</p> <p>In the weeks she was recovering in hospital, I was travelling there three times a week and working from the waiting room. My environmental risk business was still in its infancy but it was growing quickly, so sometimes I was working 20 hours a day, but I wanted to be near Katie in case anything happened. I dealt with the stress by getting out on a hike or wild camping whenever I could, just to have 24 hours of escape and solitude.</p> <p>As Katie recovered, I had the idea of walking the length of the UK’s 15 national parks within a year, climbing the highest point in each, as a way to raise money for the Devon air ambulance which had saved Katie’s life. I wanted to feel as if I was giving something back – but also, selfishly, it would be an escape for me.</p> <p>I set off in January 2017, a year after Katie’s accident. On average, I walked 50 miles in each park so about 750 miles in total. Occasionally friends or family joined me, but mostly I did it alone. The trips had to be fitted in around work, so none took longer than three days, but doing them all over a short space of time made it physically challenging.</p> <p>I walked the Cairngorms in two days, seeing a herd of reindeer, and Dartmoor in 36 hours. I’d carry everything I needed, including a tent to wild camp, though sometimes I would find somewhere to stay. It was amazing, and I experienced some of the most beautiful places in Britain. I especially liked the most remote places – I fell in love with the North York Moors, which is one of the least visited national parks, and Northumberland.</p>    <p>I had a moment of realisation while walking in Dartmoor. The isolation and breathtaking scenery helped my mind to switch off from the day-to-day, and made me realise how intense my work was. It gave me the motivation to take a deep breath and consider a totally new career path, even if it meant I would need to leave everything I had built up, and start again.</p> <p>It didn’t happen overnight. In the years afterwards, I sold my business but stayed on, working for a multibillion-pound corporation and each month flying to Canada, where it was based.</p> <p>My family had therapy after Katie’s accident, but I chose not to. My escape, my therapy, was being outdoors, being in remote places on my own. Carrying everything you need on your back and camping in the wild gives you an experience you don’t get from many things, because you are effectively in survival mode. You are only thinking about the next minute or the next 10 minutes. That was how I was able to disconnect from everything.</p> <p>I wanted to build something that would allow other people to feel that. In 2021, I left the corporate job and, last year, set up <a href=\"https://www.campwild.uk/\">CampWild</a> with a friend; we’d been talking for years about how to make wild camping accessible. There are two main barriers. One is people’s potential lack of confidence and skill: knowing where to go, what to take, what to expect and also the legality of it – can I do it, will someone move me on? The second barrier is the amount of land locked away in private ownership. We negotiate with landowners to give people access to places.</p> <p>Katie has pretty much made a full recovery. She is an amazing woman, and she has motivated me to try to help other people and do something I love. My work now involves going off for days at a time. I’ll switch off, roam around private land and find beautiful and previously inaccessible places for other people to go and have that same wonderful experience.</p> <p><strong>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "body" : "<p>In Tangier, fresh off the ferry from Spain, I walk along the esplanade in cool morning air, then take the steps up into the casbah. My journey to Morocco started at St Pancras station in London three days earlier, and I spent a night each in Barcelona and Algeciras. I feel none of the dislocation or awkwardness that a flight would entail. I’ve seen the landscapes change: the lavender fields of Provence, the peach groves of Catalonia, then the wild upland magic of La Mancha. I spotted my first Arabic sign in Spain yesterday. Now the crafted casbah of Tangier seems like the natural next step. I take a turn up a narrow alleyway and pass an elderly couple, the woman in a straw hat decorated with fresh flowers, her husband hooded in a thick woollen burnous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/embed-16-zip/giv-13425nWA5FYUnmMnj/\" data-alt=\"Map Morocco\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/01/embed-16-zip/giv-13425nWA5FYUnmMnj/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The casbah is quiet. I stumble into the only place where things are happening: the meat market. By western supermarket standards, this bazaar is a challenge: entire blood-dripping carcasses on hooks, a man sorting through yards of slithery steaming intestines with his bare hands. </p> <p>Morocco was once a place where Westerners headed for a decent dose of culture shock. In 1867 Mark Twain arrived on the grand tour that would result in his classic, The Innocents Abroad: “We wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign – foreign from top to bottom – foreign from center to circumference – foreign inside and outside and all around – nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness – nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun. And lo! In Tangier we have found it ...”</p> <p>He was not the only one. William Burroughs wrote The Naked Lunch in a Tangier hotel room. Jack Kerouac, Tennessee Williams and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/19/news.obituaries\">Paul Bowles</a> all came for inspiration. Later came the musicians: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/sep/12/graham-nash-review-the-lyrics-are-iffy-but-the-melodies-remain-magic\">Graham Nash</a> jumped on the Marrakech Express in 1966; Hendrix’s Castles Made of Sand was inspired by Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, while the Rolling Stones almost came to grief here in 1967. </p> <p>But that’s history: what about now?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We loop back into the Atlas Mountains and a miraculously green ribbon of fecundity curling from a slot canyon </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tangier station is clean and cool, the high-speed train leaves on time and we are soon whipping down the coast. At Casablanca I change to an older, slower train, but to be honest I am glad of the switch in pace. I want to see the environment: the spectacular bougainvillaea, the vast pastures dotted with flocks and shepherds, the houses built for both heat and extreme cold. The station at Marrakech, when I arrive, is as swish and swept as anything Europe can offer. They are putting in new sewers in the casbah. No one sidles up to offer me hashish or grab my arm.</p>    <p>In fact, I’ll confess to a pang of anxiety. Has Morocco been sanitised? Does everyone go home happy with their Instagram full of horizon pools and golf courses? As soon as I walk into the casbah, however, that fear begins to fall away.</p> <p>I have one night in Marrakech to meet my sister, Jo, who has arrived separately (we are here before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/sep/15/after-moroccos-devastating-earthquake-the-tourism-industry-rallies-round\">8 September earthquake</a>, but I have heard that signs of its impact in the city have been cleared up). We head out immediately to explore. The old city is not so much a labyrinth as a convoluted series of embedded mazes. If you are not lost within a minute, you’re not trying hard enough. Eventually we pop out in Djemaa el-Fna square, where there’s a snake charmer whose serpent looks like it swallowed all the dope. The food stallholders shout, “My friend, you must eat here. We are the best. Guaranteed no diarrhoea.”</p> <p>When the lamps are lit, the square is magnificent. Down one alleyway, a boy jogs alongside us and tries to set fire to a leather belt – to prove it’s real. And there, in front of me, is a youth with wild hair, dusty rucksack, boots falling apart, eyes shining unnaturally. He’s a survivor of the grand old days. He’s from 1969. He’s on the Marrakach Express. I resist asking the belt boy to test the apparition for realness.</p>    <p>Next day we join a group heading for some rock climbing and yoga on a journey across the snowy Atlas Mountains (the areas we visit felt September’s earthquake but escaped largely undamaged). We stop at designated “tourist-friendly” spots where lots of people were selling jewellery, but the natural bonhomie of Morocco soon wins out over commercialism. I’m taken on an impromptu tour of a traditional house and introduced to the family matriarch. A detour to a “desert experience”, a clunkingly kitsch campsite complete with men dressed as Tuareg warriors is not my kind of thing, but the vast golden dunes are impressive. “They move north every year,” a local tells me. I watch tourists on quad bikes ripping up and down them, surfing the wave of the climate crisis.</p>    <p>We loop back into the southern flank of the Atlas Mountains and a miraculously vivid green ribbon of fecundity curling out from a slot canyon in a rock wall. This is Wadi Todra, in places half a mile wide, but generally much narrower. Ever since the Berbers arrived here from the east, they have built shelters on these steep rocky banks. No one knows the precise origins of these people: they call themselves Amazigh, but Egypt, Ethiopia and Yemen have all been mooted as possible starting points. The mud architecture reminds me of the Hadhramaut region in east-central Yemen: great towers and citadels of mud and straw, now surrounded by concrete and block buildings that do at least try to emulate that original style. One tradition is rigorously upheld: the houses are never built in that precious ribbon of fertility, only on the rock above. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Peach and quince trees are in blossom. The path meanders. We reach a wonderful ancient mosque</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On a sudden whim, Jo and I decide to leave the vehicle about nine miles from our final destination. We will walk there inside the narrow section of canyon and along this green valley bottom. Down here there are tidy tiny fields of mint, carrots and wheat, each served by a gurgling channel of water. A donkey is being laden with alfalfa wrapped in sackcloth. A hoopoe struts at its feet. White heads of egrets pop up from a fresh green field of barley. Two women, their chins and cheeks tattooed with crosses, smile and go back to tending their crops. The peach and quince trees are in blossom. The path meanders. We reach a wonderful ancient mosque, Ikelane, near Tinghir, and find its caretaker, Addi, who shows us around. “The casbah of Afalour was abandoned from the 1970s,” he tells me, “People wanted to live in new houses near the road. They had more children and needed more rooms.”</p>    <p>The mosque itself is an architectural gem, but behind is the abandoned casbah, the mud towers collapsing, like an artistic miracle of chocolate ice-cream. In a decade it may all be gone. The families that left now want the land. Addi shrugs. “The old way needed maintenance. Rains here have got heavier and that means when the water gets in, the buildings deteriorate faster. We can only manage to keep this mosque intact.”</p> <p>We explore the cool, spacious interiors and a panoramic roof terrace overlooking the date palms and peach trees, then return to the green ribbon, picking our way along field edges and streams. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Two toddlers are playing a game. It appears to be called ‘Chuck dust in the air then scream joyfully when it lands on you’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At last, we rejoin the road and arrive at our hotel near the rock climbing walls of the canyon. Next day, with guides Dan and Max, our little group spend the day climbing on some superb rock. We drink from a spring in the canyon wall and a picnic is brought up from the village. In the evening we do strenuous yoga with Dan’s partner, Natalie, on the roof of their house. They came here shortly before the pandemic and decided, in an instant, to drop their careers in the UK and start a new life. “The pandemic actually helped us,” says Dan, “It gave us time to get to know people, and they realised we were truly committed to living here.”</p>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/sep/02/my-epic-three-day-trip-from-london-to-morocco-by-train-and-ferry\">My epic three-day trip from London to Morocco by train and ferry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are challenges. “Trying to get people to understand about plastic rubbish is hard,” says Natalie. The gorge, however, makes it all possible: there are hundreds of climbing routes, most of them particularly well-suited to beginners or moderately capable climbers like myself. The course attracts beginners, but also more experienced climbers scouting out the possibilities of Morocco.</p> <p>One day Dan leads us up on to the high plateau to meet a friend of his: Ahmed, an 82-year-old Bedouin grandfather who lives in a cave, tending his goats. His daughter is carding goat hair to make a new summer tent. Two barefoot toddlers are playing a game. It appears to be called “Chuck dust and dirt in the air then scream joyfully when it lands on you”. They keep this up for the entire time we are drinking tea with Ahmed and stop only when three goat kids come bounding over to start a new game called “Chase baby goats and cuddle them”.</p>    <p>Before we leave, Ahmed wants to show me something: his flour mill. At the back of a cave excavated into the bedrock, he searches through his possessions: empty flour sacks, battered goat skins and a few clothes. Eventually he finds a granite stone that is rotated by hand, a thing of utter simplicity, but so perfectly balanced it requires little effort. There is no electricity here, or running water, but Ahmed does not want to go anywhere else. All around are vast panoramas of skeletal unpolluted mountains. Two sons left for the town to get an education – one is now a lawyer – but Ahmed will stay on the high rocky plateau where he was born. For all the development and high-speed rail links, Morocco has given me my Mark Twain moment.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 January 2024 because an earlier version implied that Marrakech is the capital of Morocco.</p> <p><em>Overland travel was provided by <a href=\"https://www.eurail.com/en\">EUrail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.frs.es/en/\">FRS ferries</a>.

            "body" : "<p>Elon Musk, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/20/elon-musk-unions-tesla\">notoriously anti-union CEO</a> of the electric car giant Tesla, finds himself on the ropes in his dispute with Swedish workers. After more than two months of strikes – <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/us-electric-car-maker-faces-swedish-union-shock\">the first against Tesla anywhere in the world</a> – 10 Swedish unions have so far launched industrial action against the company and the pressure is growing.</p> <p>The issue at the core of the original dispute concerns Tesla and the Swedish industrial union IF Metall, which sought a collective agreement to provide better wages and benefits for<strong> </strong>mechanics in Tesla’s repair shops. The union’s members in Sweden have been on strike since 27 October.</p> <p>Tesla was already under pressure to unionise <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-launches-bid-organize-tesla-entire-non-union-auto-sector-2023-11-29/\">in the US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-21/first-woman-to-lead-germany-s-biggest-union-takes-aim-at-tesla\">in Germany</a>, where it has a large proportion of its almost 130,000 employees. So far Musk has managed to bat away their complaints. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/21/auto-strike-elon-musk-tesla\">Tesla was unaffected</a>, for example, by a six-week <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/briefing/uaw-strike.html\">American automotive strike</a> last year, because workers in the US (like those in the UK) have few legal protections if they strike against employers that refuse to recognise unions.</p> <p>But nowhere in the world is the pressure stronger than in Sweden, which has been a trade union stronghold for more than 100 years.</p> <p>Unions in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/tesla-strike-sweden-elon-musk/\">Norway, Denmark and Finland have now joined</a> their Swedish counterparts. This is because of another power that sets Nordic unions apart from their Anglo-Saxon comrades: the right to take solidarity industrial action, which was abolished in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act\">US in 1947</a>, and in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Act_1982\">UK in 1982</a>.</p> <p>While other Swedish unions have no stake in the current dispute, they have <a href=\"https://onlabor.org/tesla-strike-set-to-escalate-further-as-more-unions-join/\">come out in support of IF Metall</a>. So for instance, the <a href=\"https://www.sef.se/om-oss/nyheter/2023/elektrikerna-backar-if-metall-och-varslar-om-sympatiatgarder/\">electrical workers’ union</a> is blocking maintenance and repairs to Tesla’s repair shops and 213 charging stations throughout the country. <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/11/20/swedish-postal-workers-strike-against-tesla\">The postal workers’ union</a> has stopped mail deliveries to all Tesla offices (including licence plates for new vehicles), <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/swedish-labour-union-stop-collecting-tesla-waste-sweden-2023-12-13/\">the transportation union</a> will stop waste disposal for Tesla repair shops and has blocked the unloading of new Tesla cars in Sweden’s approximately 50 ports, and the <a href=\"https://www.uni-europa.org/news/cleaners-join-solidarity-strike-at-tesla-in-sweden/\">building maintenance union</a> is blocking all cleaning in Tesla’s repair shops and offices.</p> <p>The unions acting in solidarity consider it especially important not to allow a big corporation to evade one of the pillars of the Nordic labour market model: collective agreements between employers and unions. If they look the other way with Tesla, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/01/tesla-swedish-unions-elon-musk\">the unions reason,</a> other employers may follow suit. That would increase the share of workers not covered by collective agreements, which would pose a serious <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99caf360-7c21-4251-9167-f08a8fa6c9f8\">threat to the Swedish economic model</a>.</p> <p>Almost 90% of the workforce in Sweden is currently covered by collective bargaining. This rate of coverage is crucial because the Swedish model of worker protection rests far more on collective agreements than on legislation. For instance, there is no statutory minimum wage, and provisions on working time, employment security, pensions and other benefits are entirely or partly regulated in agreements.</p> <p>Both unions and employers are content with the status quo. It allows unions to bargain for better wages and working conditions, and employers can adapt regulations flexibly to their sectors and businesses even at the firm level, in a manner that nationally applicable legislation might not allow.</p> <p>However, this system will become unsustainable if employers begin opting out. The alternatives would then be to extend collective agreements by law, as in <a href=\"https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/european-industrial-relations-dictionary/extension-collective-agreements\">some other European countries</a> – or to simply use legislation, which relegates labour market issues to the realm of party politics and usually sets standards far below collectively bargained provisions.</p> <p>Swedish politicians typically maintain an arm’s-length approach to labour disputes, and both the <a href=\"https://www.svd.se/a/WRzpPQ/kristersson-om-tesla-svensk-lag-ar-tydlig\">prime minister</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.di.se/nyheter/l-ledaren-trakigt-om-tesla-lamnar-sverige/\">employment minister</a> have made public statements pledging not to interfere in the Tesla standoff. A Tesla lobbyist’s reported request for a meeting with the latter was said to have been <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/l3PQdM/tesla-forsokte-paverka-regeringen-via-mejl\">declined by the ministry</a>.</p> <p>Another unorthodox measure has been similarly unsuccessful: namely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/07/tesla-loses-legal-action-sweden-nordic-unions-licence-plates-collective-bargaining\">Tesla’s lawsuits</a> against the postal service PostNord and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/27/tesla-suing-swedens-transport-agency-in-escalation-of-strike-row-licence-plates\">Swedish transport agency</a> over their decisions to respect the postal union’s blockade of deliveries of licence plates for new Teslas. The blockade has been partially upheld by the Swedish courts in preliminary decisions.</p> <p>Not only are political and legal avenues now problematic, public sentiment has also turned against Tesla. According to <a href=\"https://www.svd.se/a/O8xzPk/58-procent-av-svenskarna-stoder-strejken-pa-tesla-20-procent-ar-emot\">a recent poll</a>, almost six out of 10 Swedes support the strike and only two out of 10 are against it. More than half say that Tesla’s brand has been harmed by the dispute.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pressure is also growing in the financial markets. A large <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/danish-pension-fund-sell-its-tesla-shares-over-union-dispute-2023-12-06/\">Danish pension fund</a> has decided to sell its Tesla holdings, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-should-reconsider-labour-union-relations-nordic-investors-say-2023-12-14/\">16 Nordic institutional investors</a>, including pension funds and insurance companies, have signed a joint letter urging Tesla to sign a collective agreement with IF Metall.</p> <p>Elon Musk seems to neither care about nor even understand the Swedish model. His stance on unions is ideological, but also misinformed. Which is why there may be some hope of a pivot. At a recent <a href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dealbook-summit-2023-elon-musk-interview-transcript\">New York Times forum</a>, Musk offered some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/20/elon-musk-unions-tesla\">much-publicised</a> derogatory remarks about unions. But he also made a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sctgA2qa-rA?si=R8JKsLYrit9sogAI&amp;t=282\">less noted </a>remark: “I don’t know, maybe we’ll be unionised.” He went on to say that he would consider it a failure – but the important thing is that he does not appear to rule it out.</p> <p>Musk should consider the idiosyncrasies of the Nordic countries with the same interest that he studies car batteries or rocket designs. He would then realise that these economies have managed to be not only socially inclusive and egalitarian, but flexible, innovative and internationally competitive.</p> <p>In the past 30 years, Sweden has had approximately <a href=\"https://www.ekonomifakta.se/Fakta/Arbetsmarknad/Loner/Loneutveckling-och-inflation/?graph=/20419/1/1993-/\">60% real wage growth</a> for workers on all income levels, and remains among the world’s <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-inequality-gini-index\">least unequal countries</a>. Meanwhile, the country consistently ranks among the world’s most <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/\">innovative</a>, <a href=\"https://www.imd.org/centers/wcc/world-competitiveness-center/rankings/world-competitiveness-ranking/\">competitive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/index/\">economically free</a> nations (scoring higher than the US and the UK on most measures). And to be clear, this does not come with the cost of labour unrest. In fact, strikes are exceedingly rare in Sweden and its labour market is among the <a href=\"https://www.etui.org/strikes-map\">most peaceful in Europe</a>. The Tesla strike is a rare exception. Put simply, the model benefits workers and firms, which is why it is widely supported.</p> <p>In the current<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/04/britain-15-year-economic-slump-unequal-poorer-workers\"> debate </a>about how to increase British productivity as well as economic equality, it would be wise for UK policymakers, legislators and employer associations to turn their attention to Sweden. A good start would be to recognise the economy-wide benefits of a strong labour movement.</p> <ul> <li><p>German Bender is chief analyst at the progressive Swedish thinktank Arena and a former visiting research fellow at Harvard Law School</p></li> </ul>",

            "body" : "<p>From Barton Fink to Adaptation, the creatively blocked Los Angeles lifer is part of the city’s mythology – and this amusing splatterhouse horror-comedy is a nice addition to that canon. Orbiting around dilly-dallying and passive-aggressive prog-rocker William Brown (Jonah Ray Rodrigues), this film makes homicidal psychosis look like a blast. And it also gives Alex Winter his best acting role since Bill &amp; Ted (also part of the blocked-LA-artist genre, come to think of it) yucking it up as a severed head.</p> <p>William is hamster-wheeling his way to nowhere in his sound-engineer day job, while eternally finishing off a prog meisterwerk in his home studio. His lovely girlfriend Emily (Kiran Deol) puts up with his quirks, which include a pathological inability to confront their new neighbour Vlad (Winter) about the non-stop partying next door that is further impeding his progress. So when he finally does the dreaded door knock and is drawn into an impromptu wrestling bout with the incorrigible Slav, it’s safe to say that accidentally impaling his neighbour on an exposed barbell wasn’t part of the plan.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puY9AthRUCQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/puY9AthRUCQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It’s not the last time this “serial manslaughterer” strikes. Like the hapless hitman skit from Mulholland Drive, Brown keeps racking up the accidental deaths, egged on by Winter’s decapitated bonce. Director Josh Forbes flirts with the idea he might actually be delusional, but milks the discomfort of the viscera-splattered David Byrne-esque straight man with loving detail. The faux-80s YouTube videos from the bass player of prog legends Dawn Dimension are great, doubling up as corpse-disposal tutorials: “So you fucked up and killed somebody! Relax. When the band goes on tour, it’s gonna happen.”</p> <p>The prosthetics are equally relishsome: Forbes must have made an SFX artist very happy the day he placed an order for a human face smushed by a van’s tyre tread. Even so, at 85 minutes, Destroy All Neighbors gets a little indulgent, and the plot, as William finds his creative mojo in the company of his newly acquired ghoulish ensemble, is throwaway. But it’s a gleeful lo-fi rampage all the same.</p> <p>• Destroy All Neighbors is available on Shudder from 12 January.</p>",

            "body" : "<p><strong>I’m having difficulty getting a refund from British Airways after it cancelled our honeymoon flight to Japan with 14 hours’ notice. We were not offered an alternative flight and, by the time we received the notification, the BA call centre was closed. We therefore had to buy new tickets with another carrier. In Japan we also incurred £125 in roaming charges when calling BA to ensure it did not cancel our return tickets.</strong></p> <p><strong>On our return, I demanded BA refund the £566 price difference between the new and cancelled flights, and pay the £520 compensation due to each of us under airline regulations. I heard nothing for weeks, and was told that my complaint could not be escalated until 90 days had passed. In the end, it took 16 weeks to send a reply, which merely offered a refund of roaming charges.</strong></p> <p><strong>The statutory compensation was only offered when I complained again. They continued to refuse to refund us the price difference in flight tickets despite admitting “concern” that they had been unable to rebook us themselves.<br></strong><em><strong>LOB, London</strong></em></p> <p>It seems unlikely you are the only one in this situation. Airlines are obliged to offer a refund or a rebooking, with another carrier if necessary, when a flight is cancelled at short notice. But you say there were no options in your booking portal, and you couldn’t call as its helplines shut at 8pm. Nor did the cancellation notice mention the compensation you were due.</p> <p>BA tells me it was your fault you incurred the costs of a new flight because you did not call it. It claims it provided a 24/7 helpline number in the cancellation email.</p> <p>That’s not the case. The email, which I have seen, simply provided a link to the customer service lines that close at 8pm.</p> <p>With staggering insouciance, its response rejecting your claim stated your feedback had “made a difference” to customer service improvements, and it hoped that you would book with BA again. Finally, six months after your trip and two months after I began hassling BA, it stumped up the £566.</p> <p><em><strong>CS</strong></em> of Chilton, Buckinghamshire, was also left grounded and out of pocket by BA. “There appears to be a black mark against my name on its system and, despite my bookings looking fine at my end, they won’t let me check in,” she writes.</p> <p>“I was recently unable to board a flight to Edinburgh for a wedding, although my husband, whose ticket was on the same booking, was able to fly. I had to pay for another flight from another airport, which invalidated my return, so I had to buy a new ticket from BA to get home.</p> <p>“The system failed to recognise my booking on that journey, too, and on a different trip I made to Geneva, although in both cases check-in staff were able to resolve it in time to board. I have asked BA to refund my £457 expenses, but it just sends automated messages saying I was a no-show.”</p> <p>BA first told me you had issued a chargeback via your bank for the Edinburgh booking, which had invalidated your ticket.</p> <p>You say you did no such thing. At which point BA changed its story and blamed the fact you and your husband had upgraded to business class, which caused your ticket (but not his) to “drop out of the system”.</p> <p>This also seems an unlikely explanation, but BA is sticking with it. It has, at least, now refunded your additional costs, and added a gesture of goodwill.</p> <p><em>Email <a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\">your.problems@observer.co.uk</a>.

            "body" : "<p>Apple TV+’s new drama opens at night with Peter Capaldi apparently working as a taxi driver, with two obnoxious characters in the back. The waves of fury and hatred roll off him. I want to note up top that Capaldi marauding the mean streets of London or Glasgow à la Taxi Driver is a show I would watch. Imagine Capaldi as a man forced into nightly proximity with humanity. Wouldn’t you give just about anything to see that? </p> <p>Fortunately, this show gives him an almost equally sublime role to play. Criminal Record essentially functions as a showcase for Capaldi as DCI Daniel Hegarty, an old-school detective (of the un-bonhomous type), and Cush Jumbo as DS June Lenker, whose race and sex are enough for him to mark her down as part of the new guard.</p> <p>Their paths intersect when a domestic violence victim makes an anonymous call suggesting that her partner might have previously killed someone called Adelaide Burrows. Lenker finds out that Hegarty was the investigating officer on the Burrows case and the victim’s boyfriend, Errol Mathis, was charged with her murder. Mathis is serving a 24-year prison sentence – possibly wrongly.</p> <p>Alone, Jumbo or Capaldi can hold anyone’s attention. Together, squaring off as adversaries, they are mesmerising. If ever there is going to be an award invented for best joint performance, make it this year, for them. Capaldi is terrifying as the cold predator sniffing round his prey, searching for weakness, prepared to wait for a quick, clean kill. Jumbo is fantastic as an opponent far from unaffected by all he brings to their contest – experience, connections, an indeterminable amount of malevolence – but resolving to go ever harder at him and at the truth about Mathis’s conviction and Burrows’s killer. We see Hegarty meet up with his old crew to check that previous arrangements will withstand a new inspection.</p>    <p>Through the protagonists, Criminal Record interrogates many depressingly pertinent issues in depressingly timely fashion. Most overtly, it looks at racism in institutional and individual forms. In the first episode, Lenker, who is Black, is discomfited by Hegarty’s passing reference to Mathis, who is also Black, as “the poor man’s OJ” because – she presumes – he killed his white girlfriend. When Lenker tells her white partner, Leo (Stephen Campbell Moore), about it, he suggests that she is overreacting. Is she? Is it his place to tell her? Did she ask for his opinion? Is the divine right to offer it a function of white male privilege? Oh, I could go on!</p> <p>None of which is to say that Lenker is a flawless protagonist. Jumbo is given as many layers to play as Capaldi. We see many versions of that treacherous business of letting the end justify the means unfold. We are led to ask ourselves whether we should hold officers of the law, and whether they should hold themselves, to higher standards than the rest of us. All of which, of course, resonates amid the onslaught of real-life headlines about police corruption and disregard for (particularly women’s) rights and safety.</p> <p>The only drawback to giving so much time, space and glorious complexity to the main pair is that the secondary characters are slightly underbaked. Some fine actors – such as Cathy Tyson as Errol’s campaigning mother, Doris, and Zoë Wanamaker as Lenker’s elderly mother, Maureen – are not given much to do. Wanamaker’s character seems to be there to allow the programme to highlight the extra burden of care that working women shoulder and to prepare for Lenker’s entrapment by Hegarty, courtesy of his contacts at the professional standards department.</p> <p>It would also have been great to see more of Mathis’s overworked but indefatigable lawyer Sonya (Aysha Kala), simply because Kala gives one of those sudden, unexpectedly and ineffably brilliant performances that make you sit up and take notice of the television.</p> <p>Plot-wise, there is no new ground being broken here, although the intertwining of the past and present cases and their eventual unpicking is interesting enough. But the cleverness and subtlety with which so many questions are posed and issues teased out through the main characters are more than worth the price of admission. But I want Capaldi’s Taxi Driver, too.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 8 February 2024. An earlier version said that the murder victim was called Amelia Burrows rather than Adelaide Burrows.</p> <p>• Criminal Record is on Apple TV+</p>",

            "body" : "<h2>Sunday 7 January</h2> <p><strong>5am</strong> A beautiful bond was created between Hope, the cat we rescued from the street, and our own little cat. But the term “little cat” does not apply any more because she has grown and looks huge compared with Hope. She became like a mother to him: she cleans him, they play together and sleep next to each other. When she sits, he looks at her tail, takes the ready position and then attacks. He loves to wrestle with her.</p> <p>Since the vet recommended we shouldn’t feed him a lot, we have been watching his food intake. We keep the lid of the dry food Tupperware box on so he can’t open it. I have noticed that our little cat would go there and move the lid away for him to eat. He is so small that his whole body gets inside the Tupperware.</p> <p>The good thing is, his health is much better; he even has hair on his legs, which he didn’t have before. The bad thing is, having this many cats is a huge burden we’re not sure we can handle, especially given that nearby areas are being asked to evacuate. The horror is for us to face the same fate. My sister and I have had to go through our stuff again and decide what to take in case we have to leave suddenly. Living in constant fear is a living hell.</p> <p>But the little cat is not the only one who has grown attached to Hope. We have, too. He loves skin-to-skin contact. For example, he would come to me and pick either my neck or the small space between the bottom of my trousers and the top of my socks where the skin is showing. He would hug that part and sleep for hours. Also, whenever I sat with my legs bent to one side, Hope would come and put his head over my knee and just look around and observe us.</p> <p>A very tough decision faces us that we have been trying to avoid: he needs another place, because we don’t have the capacity to take care of him. For a few days, I have been looking for someone to take him. We agreed to provide this person with the food, the required medicine and pocket money for any additional needs. Unfortunately, even the owners of cats wish someone would take theirs because of the harsh conditions we are going through.</p>    <p>Finally, a friend of Ahmad tells me his cousin is willing to take Hope in. I tell him I need to visit and make sure that the place is suitable, and more importantly, that his cousin is a good person. It is not enough that he is willing to take care of Hope, I need to make sure he is a loving, caring guy. We agree to meet the next day.</p> <p><strong>10am</strong> On my way to see a friend, I notice two women and some children sitting on the pavement. It is no longer a surprise to see people in the street with no place to go. I feel terrible because they are homeless, and I wonder: aren’t we all homeless right now? Many people have evacuated for the third or fourth time and there is no space left for them to go.</p> <p>When I meet my friend, I tell him about the two women, and we go to see if we can help. They tell us they couldn’t even find a tent to stay in and they had no place to go. My friend decided to knock on the door of the nearest house. He talked to the owner and told him about the situation. After much discussion, the owner agreed to let them stay in the entrance leading to the house. I asked to talk to his wife to make sure there are women inside and the place is safe. She came, greeted us and said they would provide the space for the women.</p> <p>When the women heard that, they started crying. One of them said that she was relieved she would be able to breastfeed her son. My friend promised to try to find them a better place.</p>    <p><strong>11pm</strong> Complete darkness. I have never understood those who sleep with the lights on. In the past, I would turn off all the lights to sleep. Now, I hate the darkness, because it intensifies the feeling of fear, uncertainty and despair.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tell him that we love him, and the only reason we are letting him go is for his own good</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hope is on my sister’s lap, sleeping. We can’t see each other. I was lying on the couch. I know how sad she is because we will leave him, but we both know this is the best for him. Out of nowhere, she starts talking to me.</p> <p>“When you go tomorrow to see the guy, ask him to take care of Hope.”</p> <p>“OK.”</p> <p>“Tell him that the food we will give him is enough for a whole month, we will bring him more after that.”</p> <p>“OK.”</p> <p>“Tell him that we love him, and the only reason we are letting him go is for his own good.”</p> <p>“Tell whom? The guy or Hope himself?”</p> <p>Even though I couldn’t see her, I knew she was crying.</p> <h2>Monday 8 January</h2> <p><strong>2</strong><strong>pm </strong>After meeting Ahmad’s friend, we head to meet his cousin for “the interview” as he jokingly calls it. Ahmad’s friend has never had a pet in his life so he does not understand how important this meeting is for me. To be honest, it is not the act of giving Hope to another person that I find painful – in normal circumstances, we would have fostered him for a while and then found him a permanent home. It is the feeling of guilt. Am I leaving him alone? </p> <p>On our way, Ahmad’s friend sees two guys he met recently after they evacuated to his area. I discovered later that one of them comes from a very wealthy family. They owned a building that was levelled to the ground.</p> <p>They are laughing. The guy tells us the story: “So, all I have left – I mean <em>had</em> – were two pairs of trousers, two T-shirts, three pairs of underwear and three pairs of socks. I woke up this morning and could not find my clothes. I washed them last night and hung them out to dry. This morning, they were gone. After hours of searching, we reached the market, and I found out that someone had stolen my clothes and was selling them.”</p> <p>I told him: “Well, that is good, you got your clothes back.”</p> <p>“No, I did not,” he said, laughing. “The thief was a woman. So, when I wanted to go talk to her, my father stopped me, and he told me that this woman might be in a dire need to steal clothes and sell them. So we agreed to do something I never thought in my life I would do. I decided to buy my clothes back.”</p> <p>The other guy was laughing so hard I thought he would have a heart attack.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/03/gaza-diary-part-39-my-year-ended-with-sadness-singing-and-an-imaginary-cake\">Gaza diary part 39: ‘My year ended with sadness, singing and an imaginary cake’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“But guess what?” he says. “By the time we reached her, another man had bought most of the stuff. But I was able to buy something.”</p> <p>By now, the other guy was literally on the ground laughing.</p> <p>“I bought back my boxers. My used, worn boxer briefs. For twice their original price.”</p>    <p>At that moment, I realised how unfunny the story was. How this guy and his friend who were laughing, were actually crying inside. I stopped smiling, looked at him and said: “I’m so sorry for your loss. It must have been very difficult for you to go through that.”</p> <p>They both went silent and he said: “Thank you for saying that.”</p> <p><strong>3</strong><strong>pm </strong>We enter Ahmad’s cousin home. I feel relieved to see a big area and surrounding trees. This means that Hope will have a beautiful space. We sit on the chairs outside and they offer us tea.</p> <p>The cousin is one of the kindest people you could meet. He is 20 years old, and has three adorable cats himself. He was very nice, he asked about all the details related to Hope: health, food habits, etc. I thanked him for agreeing to take in a stray cat, but he was more than happy. He even refused to take any money for unexpected expenses, but I insisted. </p> <p>On our way out, he put his hand out to shake mine, but instead, I hugged him.</p> <p>“Thank you,” I said. “Thank you very, very, very much.”</p> <p>I, a homeless person myself, displaced and not safe, was grateful that little Hope, had found a home.</p>  ",

            "body" : "<p>Good morning. At about 2pm local time yesterday, a live news broadcast on an Ecuadorian TV channel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/ecuador-gangs-wave-terror-state-of-emergency\">was interrupted by a group of masked men carrying guns</a>, grenades, and dynamite. The intruders pointed guns at employees and made them lie on the floor. “Don’t shoot, please don’t shoot!” one person shouted. One of the attackers said the attack was the result of “messing with the mafias”. The TC Televisión broadcast continued for at least 15 minutes. Then the signal was cut off.</p> <p>Some 13 gunmen were later arrested, and the hostages taken to safety. The astonishing scenes in the city of Guayaquil were part of a series of audacious coordinated attacks by members of Ecuadorian gangs that have killed at least 10 people. They follow the escape from prison of the country’s most feared gang leader, Adolfo Macías, and new president Daniel Noboa’s subsequent declaration of a state of emergency. And while the situation is evolving rapidly, it appears to represent a declaration of war on the country’s fragile democratic institutions.</p> <p>Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-collyns\">Dan Collyns</a>, explains what we know about what just happened. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Post Office Horizon scandal </strong></em>| The former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/former-post-office-boss-paula-vennells-to-return-cbe-amid-horizon-scandal\">is to hand back her CBE over the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of staff</a>, with over 100 more potential victims having come forward in recent weeks. Vennells said on Tuesday she was “truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families”.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Israel-Gaza war</strong></em> | The British government has accepted that Israel as an occupying power <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/uk-government-accepts-israel-has-legal-duty-to-provide-basic-supplies-to-gaza\">had a legal duty to provide basic supplies to the people of Gaza</a>. David Cameron, the foreign secretary, told MPs that Israel should remove barriers on the delivery of humanitarian aid that were risking “real, widespread hunger”.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Climate crisis </strong></em>| 2023 has smashed the record for the world’s hottest year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/09/2023-record-world-hottest-climate-fossil-fuel\">by a huge margin</a>.

Action by law enforcement after the tunnel came to light led to a brawl with those who had created the passageway.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘A declaration of war on the Ecuadorian state’</h2>    <p>About half an hour after the masked men appeared at the TV studio, armed police officers arrived on the scene and entered the building. After the perpetrators were arrested, Alina Manrique, the head of news for TC Television, told the Associated Press: “I am still in shock. Everything has collapsed … All I know is that it’s time to leave this country, and go very far away.”</p> <p>Manrique’s despair points to a much larger crisis linked to the country’s rampant drug gangs. “Ecuadorians are more scared than they’ve ever been,” Dan said. “It’s only in the last few years that it has become such a violent country – people aren’t immune to it. The country is now in shock. This does feel like a declaration of war on the Ecuadorian state.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>What happened yesterday?</p> <p>As well as the attack on the TV studio, a series of apparently related incidents took place across the country. At least seven police officers were kidnapped. A vehicle was set ablaze at a petrol station in the capital, Quito. Explosives were used in further attacks in the provinces of Esmereldas and Los Rios. There was a jailbreak in the town of Riobamba. Five hospitals were also overtaken.</p> <p>All of this followed riots in at least six jails on Monday, with guards taken hostage and threatened with death if soldiers were deployed to retake control. Videos disseminated on WhatsApp purported to show guards being lynched, Dan said, though he cautioned they were unconfirmed.</p> <p>As schools, shops and public buildings closed down, the streets were in gridlock as people fled to the safety of their homes. Ecuador’s new president, Daniel Noboa, declared a state of emergency. “We are not going to negotiate with terrorists,” he said.</p> <p>The response to that from the gangs was unambiguous. In one prison video, a guard reads out a message with a gun pointed at his head: “You declared war, you will get war,” he says. “You declared a state of emergency. We declare police, civilians and soldiers to be the spoils of war.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Who did this, and why?</p>    <p>The immediate spark for the chaos of the last couple of days was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/ecuador-adolfo-macias-fito-missing-gang-leader\">the escape on Sunday of convicted gang leader Adolfo Macías, alias Fito</a>, from his cell in the prison complex in Guayaquil – the country’s largest city.</p> <p>Macías is the leader of the Los Choneros gang, one of the most powerful in Ecuador, which is believed to have links to Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel. He was serving a 34-year prison sentence, and previously escaped for several weeks in 2013.</p> <p>He is said to have been tipped off shortly before he was due to be transferred to a maximum security facility. Macías was living in a spacious cell decorated with murals and had been <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vg98ylLkPp8?si=_B79IS0PdHAmFNVw\">shown in a music video</a>, ‘The Lion’s Ballad’, relaxing in the prison courtyard and petting a fighting cockerel (pictured above).</p> <p>“That showed the amount of power these kingpins have even when they’re locked up,” Dan said. “The fact that Macías escaped is not surprising to anyone who knows how things operate in Ecuador. But the extent of the violence we’ve seen since has taken people by surprise. Whether or not it’s not co-ordinated, there are different gangs that are part of this wave of violence.”</p> <p>Yesterday, Noboa decreed that 22 gangs were now classified as terrorist groups. “They want to be left alone to operate with impunity,” Dan said. “Before, where they would be killing each other, they are now collectively fighting the Ecuadorian state.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>How strong are gangs in Ecuador?</p> <p>Four months ago, Dan reported from Guayaquil <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/12/ecuador-violence-bloody-drug-war\">on Ecuador’s “nightmarish descent into violence”</a> over recent years: the gangs have operated with impunity within the prison system there, and used jails as bases for their operations.</p> <p>In Guayaquil, Dan visited the scenes of gang assassinations and met with relatives of those who had been killed. “It felt like a dark place,” he said. “It’s a bit like Manila and Miami in the same city. There are riverside slums where there are no opportunities at all which are used as routes to get drugs into containers for shipping. And at the same time you have exclusive estates where people barely go out because of the security situation. It is a very unequal city at the heart of this trade.”</p> <p>There was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/02/ecuadorian-prisons-guards-police-hostage-released\">a mass hostage-taking</a> in six prisons in September and a wave of violence including car bombs and a dynamite attack on a bridge after a senior gang leader was transferred to a new jail. The spike in violence had led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/ecuador-presidential-candidate-fernando-villavicencio-killed\">the shocking assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio</a>, who was shot dead in August as he left a campaign event. Villavicencio was an anti-corruption candidate who had accused Los Choneros and Macías of threatening him in the days before he was killed.</p> <p>The murder rate in Ecuador has jumped almost 500% since 2016, with police attributing 80% of the killings to gangs, <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/ecuador/ecuadors-high-tide-drug-violence\">according to Crisis Group</a>. “That’s one of the highest rates in the world, even by Latin American standards,” Dan said. Local news reports regularly describe beheadings, public hangings, and police assassinations as rivals vie for control of the trade.</p> <p>The rise in gang violence has been attributed to the killing of Los Choneros’ previous leader, Jorge Zambrano, in 2020. That sparked a struggle for control over drug-trafficking routes and territory. At least 400 prison inmates have died since 2021.</p> <p>Meanwhile, cartels from as far afield as Mexico and Albania <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/world/americas/ecuador-drug-cartels.html\">have sought a piece of the Ecuadorian drug trade</a> and are financing local operations. Central to the chaos has been the export of cocaine – a major source of wealth for Ecuador’s gangs because of increased cultivation in neighbouring Colombia and years of lax policing.</p> <p>***</p> <p>How has the government responded to the violence?</p>    <p>Noboa (above), the centre-right 35-year-old heir to a banana fortune, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/16/daniel-noboa-wins-ecuador-presidential-election\">won the presidency in October</a> after Villavicencio’s assassination. He pledged a hard line on gang violence. Shortly after he took office, Jaime Enrique SC, the leader of Los Choneros splinter group Los Lobos, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-67509693\">was arrested</a>. That was viewed as a statement of intent and prompted reprisals against local police.</p> <p>Other measures included a policy of naming judges and prosecutors who release captured gang members, and the construction of new maximum security prisons. Last week, Noboa announced plans for a referendum on further action including an expanded role for the military. In December, he proclaimed the success of his strategy, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuadors-noboa-says-unnamed-criminal-group-has-asked-peace-deal-2023-12-06/\">saying in an interview</a>: “We have captured leaders of criminal groups in recent weeks, from the most important [groups]. One of the groups … has even asked for a peace deal.”</p> <p>But the events of this week suggest that such optimism was premature. After the TV station was stormed, Noboa said that Ecuador was now in a state of “internal armed conflict”.</p> <p>“The gangs would like to remove Noboa, because they realise that they may not be able to retain the senior institutional and judicial connections they’ve had before which have guaranteed their impunity,” Dan said. “That’s why we’ve seen this bloodbath take place.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>The Miles Without Stiles initiative has created over 50 new <strong>Lake District</strong> trails for wheelchair and pushchair users. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/jan/09/oer-vales-and-hills-in-a-wheelchair-a-new-accessible-trail-in-the-lake-district\">Ben Aitken (above) and his friend Anthony explore one route</a> in Windermere. <em><strong>Matthew</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>After the appointment of 34-year-old <strong>Gabriel Attal </strong>as France’s new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/gabriel-attals-real-challenge-will-be-to-break-french-parliaments-political-deadlock\">Angelique Chrisafis’ analysis</a> is a useful primer on the formidable challenge awaiting him in pushing president Emmanuel Macron’s agenda. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Staggering new research has shown that carbon emissions from the first two months of the war in <strong>Gaza</strong> were higher than those in 20 of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/emissions-gaza-israel-hamas-war-climate-change\">Nina Lakhani has the exclusive report</a>. <em><strong>Matthew Pearce, newsletters team</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Marina Hyde <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/09/heroes-post-office-scandal-villains\">writes ferociously</a> on <strong>the Post Office scandal</strong>, and how it suggests “a society with one rule and endless get-outs for executives, and quite another for the little people”. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Have <strong>dating apps</strong> made romance just another chore? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/10/go-and-talk-to-strangers-its-fun-why-speed-dating-is-having-a-moment\">Jordyn Beazley meets the singles</a> who have dumped swiping and are bringing speed dating back to life. <em><strong>Matthew</strong></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Sport</h2>    <p><em><strong>Football </strong></em>| <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/09/middlesbrough-chelsea-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report\">Middlesbrough secured a 1-0 lead</a> in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Chelsea.

She has also been banned from attending her English classes.</p>    <p>“I was barred from school when the Taliban took over in 2021, and now I cannot even go to my private classes,” she said. “I can no longer imagine anything for my future other than staying home and getting married.</p> <p>“I saw how badly my father was beaten because I went to the [English] course.

            "body" : "<p>Labour’s Lisa Nandy has called for an urgent focus on a two-state solution to end violence in Israel and occupied Palestine, saying the international community had not done enough to seek a lasting solution to the regional conflict before the latest outbreak of war.</p> <p>Nandy, who was visiting Jerusalem on the day the death toll in Gaza climbed to more than 23,000, said she cried hearing about the agony of Palestinians with loved ones trapped there, but believed demanding an immediate ceasefire was not the most effective way to end the violence.</p> <p>“Part of how we have ended up in this desperate situation is that for a decade and a half there has been no meaningful peace process, and this can’t happen again,” she said. “This has to be the moment when the international community steps forward and ensures that we don’t allow this to occur again.”</p>    <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also flew into Israel on Monday. He is making a fresh push to stop the war escalating into a regional conflict, and stepping up pressure on Israel to protect civilians in Gaza, allow more aid into the strip and start planning for a postwar future.</p> <p>Israeli authorities have said they expect to fight in Gaza for several more months, even as the UN, aid agencies and a large majority of the international community warn that an immediate humanitarian ceasefire is the only way to mitigate catastrophic levels of suffering.</p> <p>Nearly all the 2.3 million population are hungry and displaced from their homes, without access to clean water or sanitation. The health system has almost collapsed, with just 13 of 36 prewar hospitals functioning.</p> <p>“We all want to see the violence end as soon as possible,” Nandy said, describing the crisis in Gaza as an “overwhelming priority”. “The question is, do you believe that calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire makes one more or less likely.”</p> <p>Labour has been split by divisions over whether to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Eight frontbenchers quit their roles to back a parliamentary motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in November, when the party’s leader, Keir Starmer, backed only a humanitarian pause, and 56 MPs rebelled to support it.</p> <p>Nandy said diplomatic efforts must “recognise the current reality facing Israel”, where calls for a ceasefire are taken as rejecting the country’s right to defend itself after the biggest terror attack in its history.</p> <p>“To many people in Israel, [the call for an immediate ceasefire] is simply a call to leave your hostages in tunnels being held by Hamas, it’s a call to allow the rockets to fly, it’s a call to allow Hamas to continue to operate and to recruit.”</p> <p>The former chair of Labour Friends of Palestine, who will also travel to Jordan to discussion regional challenges, met Israeli and Palestinian officials for “cordial but robust discussions” and said she spoke to Palestinians with loved ones in Gaza.</p> <p>“I will confess this last 24 hours it has been impossible not to cry, meeting some of the people who have been affected,” Nandy said. “We went over to Ramallah, there are people [there] with family in Gaza, they are watching what is happening, they are powerless to stop it and it is literally agony watching it unfold.”</p> <p>She also visited a Bedouin village in the West Bank whose residents say they are under threat from violent settlers. While the international focus has been on Gaza, there has also been a surge in violence against Palestinians in the West Bank</p> <p>Since 7 October, more than 300 Palestinians have been killed there, more than 80 of them children, and over 1,200 people forced to leave their homes, UN figures show.</p> <p>Labour called for visa bans on violent settlers, a policy brought in by the UK government. Nandy said her visit was important to understand the situation in the West Bank, including an atmosphere of intimidation.</p> <p>“If somebody wakes you up in the middle of the night with a gun to your head, and says, ‘you’ve got to leave’, none of that is recorded in the official statistics. But it’s the job of British politicians like me to come and find out that that’s happening.”</p> <p>“If there is a prospect of getting a meaningful peace process back on track, we’ve got to deal with the widespread sense of anger, despair and hopelessness across the whole of Palestine. Not just in Gaza.”</p> <p>Working on a long-term solution with Israel’s current government involves dealing with far-right ministers with links to the settler movement, such as the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who has been accused of inciting war crimes statements by calling for the mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.</p> <p>Nandy said Labour was willing to call out specific examples of “language that is times unhelpful, and at times deeply offensive”, but would work with ministers who are part of an “elected government, chosen by the people of Israel”.</p>",

And if you live in a country village, as I do, it is hard to avoid their presence.</p> <p>They flock around the church tower, or gather along with the larger rooks and crows in the surrounding fields. Sometimes, they even wake me up as they perch on our chimney, uttering the curious call that gives the bird its name. Actually, that’s only half the story: unlike other nicknames for birds – robin redbreast, Jenny wren and so on – the name is affectionate and onomatopoeic.</p> <p>Like other common and familiar birds, jackdaws are often overlooked. But on winter evenings, they do put on a show. Half an hour or so before dusk, they gather in flocks of dozens – sometimes even hundreds – of birds, before flying low overhead towards their communal roost.</p> <p>It may not quite be as spectacular as starling murmurations, but it is still a classic sight – and sound – of the British countryside. And it reminds me why, all those years after I first encountered one, jackdaws are a bit special.</p>",

Overwhelmingly, they expressed widespread dissatisfaction over water company ownership and operations. Just 6% of the experts questioned were supportive of a continuation of the current approach to ownership, corporate governance and regulation.</p> <p>The report calls for the Conservative government to finally implement rules to create sponge cities after a decade in which ministers have delayed and attempted to scrap the plans. Sponge cities are urban zones with multiple areas of greenery, trees, ponds, soakaways, pocket parks and permeable paving to allow water to drain away. They also include measures to store rainwater and runoff, such as widespread use of water butts.</p> <p>Increased runoff from rainfall overwhelms water company sewage systems, which have not been maintained and improved by water companies as a result of under-investment. The extra water increases the likelihood of raw sewage being discharged, while hard surfaces in towns and cities increase the risk of flooding.</p> <p>In its latest business plan, Thames Water says by 2015 London had seen the biggest decrease in plant cover in front gardens of anywhere in the UK, with five times as many front gardens with no plants compared with the preceding 10 years.</p> <p>This increased the burden on sewers and the risk of pollution, the company said.</p> <p>But the Conservative government has repeatedly failed to implement rules under schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which mandated developers to install sustainable drainage systems in new developments.

            "body" : "<p>Britain is a country that tends to elect Conservative governments, while trending towards Labour. There is a tension in that condition, making the political weather unpredictable. Or rather, the unfamiliar climate provokes doubts in the polling forecast: a hard anti-Tory rain, followed by a spell of Keir Starmer in Downing Street. The needles have flickered but not moved much for over a year. The consistency of Labour’s lead suggests a structural shift in the public mood in favour of regime change.</p> <p>But confidence doesn’t come naturally to a party with multiple scars from acute disappointment and a scarcity of models for election-winning leadership. Tony Blair is the only person alive to have secured a Labour majority. That doesn’t make his method infallible, but its repudiation has proved to be a reliable route to defeat.</p> <p>The exceptional quality of Blair’s record is the straw at which Rishi Sunak clutches in hope of averting electoral catastrophe. Downing Street has a new plan for 2024. The template is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/jan/08/rishi-sunak-conservatives-election-event-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-659be51f8f0881d21e2a92b1#block-659be51f8f0881d21e2a92b1\">April 1992</a>, when a beleaguered John Major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1992/apr/10/past.electionspast\">beat Neil Kinnock</a> in defiance of low expectations, a polling deficit and a long Tory incumbency.</p> <p>The relevance to today’s circumstances is tenuous but not entirely fabricated. Then, as now, Britain had endured a period of severe economic pain. Then, as now, the Labour leader was less popular than might be expected for a man on the brink of becoming prime minister. Starmer is generally preferred as a potential prime minister to Sunak, but by the standards of opposition leaders in the run-up to a general election his ratings are more Kinnocky than Blairish.</p> <p>Sunak’s election message, rehearsed in a new year speech <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81d343b6-31d5-4271-816f-1dceb4f10615\">earlier this week</a>, is a variation on Major’s warning that delicate green shoots of recovery were at risk of being trampled under Labour. Britain has “turned a corner” and is “pointing in the right direction” but must “stick with the plan”, the prime minister said. Putting Starmer in power would send the country “back to square one”.</p> <p>Pleading for continuity in volatile times is probably the best campaign available to Sunak, which is to say the only one that isn’t preposterous given that his party has been in power for the past 14 years. (It says something about the prime minister’s faulty political antennae that he only reached the obvious pitch by way of a delusional one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/04/our-panels-verdict-on-rishi-sunaks-speech-to-the-tory-party-conference\">casting himself</a> at last year’s Tory conference as the guy to pick if you think it’s time for a change.)</p> <p>But the Conservatives’ least bad option only comes good if Starmer fulfils his assigned role, re-enacting a Labour trauma he surely remembers a lot better than Sunak, who was only 11 in April 1992. There will be no “shadow budget” containing tax rises for the Tories to advertise as bombs or “<a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O200038/labours-tax-bombshell-poster-saatchi--saatchi/\">double whammy</a>” punches ready to land on struggling households. There will be no premature victory rally like the one that Kinnock <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-39531021\">addressed in Sheffield</a> the week before polling, which has entered Westminster folklore as a parable of vote-snuffing hubristic grandiosity.</p> <p>Wariness of retreading old errors gives Starmer’s approach to the election a ponderous gait, which critics interpret as morbid timidity and supporters identify as judicious pace. The most common demands made of the Labour leader have been directed at every candidate for No 10 at some point along their journey. What is the vision? Where is the hope? What about policy?</p> <p>Every leader gives speech after lofty speech describing national renewal by way of policy and reform, which few hear and none remember. Starmer gave one <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/updates/press-releases/keir-starmers-new-year-speech/\">last week</a>. Then he took questions, most of which were challenges to match or rule out Tory tax cuts. It is hard not to sound risk-averse when every conversation becomes a prompt to leap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/22/chancellors-tax-cut-opens-door-to-early-election-and-sets-a-trap-for-labour\">into the trap</a> laid by your opponents, and every effort to change the subject is ignored.</p> <p>Partly that is what makes opposition hard. It is especially so when the pitch is skewed by a cultural habit of treating Conservative rule as Britain’s default setting – the norm from which Labour is a deviation, tending to perversion. That assumption, upheld by structural bias on Fleet Street, gets a little deeper each time Labour fails at the polls. It goes deep enough to withstand a barrage of data indicating that the Tories are disliked, out of touch with mainstream opinion and on the way out.</p> <p>Thus buttressed, ministers can make terrible policy choices on the assumption that they won’t be saddled with the consequences, and insist that the opposition mimics them as a mark of governing credibility. A Labour leader seeking to be prime minister is applying for probably the only job in the world that involves so many demands to replicate the mistakes of the person whose failure created a vacancy.</p> <p>Starmer is getting more confident in refusing to play that game, although there are only so many ways to reject the premise of a question – even one as stupid as “will you commit to doing what your enemies want?” – without sounding evasive. And the Labour leader is a private, reticent man by temperament. He lacks the easy fluency that more colourful characters can use to decant their personality into the gaps when policy answers are incomplete.</p> <p>But incomplete answers are a function of not knowing when the election will be held. The demand to be more revealing comes most insistently from those who are impatient for targets to strike. Caution does not have to express deficient ambition. It is a symptom of politics so acclimatised to Tory rule that even the imminent collapse of a despised, moribund government is configured as reason to doubt the viability of any alternative.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

Over the last three decades it has evolved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/more-than-70-per-cent-english-water-industry-foreign-ownership\">into a notoriously complex system</a> of shadow ownership that has loaded debt on to the balance sheet, while providing rich dividends for investors.</p> <p>Today, water as an industry is in varying levels of crisis. In the south-east, Thames Water, the biggest company, is riddled with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/12/thames-water-apologises-to-mps-for-confusion-over-500m-loan\">debts of £18bn</a> and struggling to extract the millions it needs from shareholders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/02/thames-waters-second-largest-investor-slashes-value-of-its-stake\">while its value plummets.</a> At South East Water, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/07/south-east-water-paid-shareholders-18m-losses\">the cost of servicing its debt has risen in six months by £7.4m to £54.8m</a> as inflation and higher interest rates bite.</p> <p>Water companies across England are <a href=\"https://environmentagency.blog.gov.uk/2023/06/23/environment-agency-investigation-into-sewage-treatment-works-moves-to-next-phase/\">under criminal investigation into suspicions</a> thousands of treatment works have been illegally dumping sewage into rivers for many years.</p> <p>Total dividends paid since 1989 have reached £83.7bn at today’s prices. Meanwhile, customers are being asked, via bill increases of up to 40%, to pay for required new investment of £96bn.</p> <p>Is there a solution for the water industry that will protect the environment, build in better accountability, provide clean drinking water and build resilience to climate change? We asked experts for their views.</p> <h2><strong>Ownership</strong></h2> <p>Dr Ewan McGaughey, a professor of law at King’s College London, argues England should join Scotland, Wales, Paris and most of the world, and restore public ownership using the legal framework of special administration that already exists.</p> <p>This can be triggered if companies are unlikely to be able to pay their debts without public subsidies or have seriously breached their duties, for example by failing to improve their pipes to stop leaks or failing to drain and clean sewers to stop pollution.</p> <p>Once in special administration, the companies can be transferred to a new publicly owned entity. Responding to the criticism that paying off shareholders and debts would cost too much, he argues the current law allows for debts to be reduced or even removed if they infringe on the water company’s ability to properly carry out its legal duties.</p> <p>Richard Murphy, of the Corporate Accountability Network and Sheffield University, argues the water companies are in effect environmentally insolvent because they do not have the financial means to raise the £260bn needed to stop their sewage dumping, according to a House of Lords assessment. Therefore no compensation is due to shareholders, or to those who lent money to the companies.</p> <p>But Murphy said in order to be pragmatic, a small offer to shareholders and a reasonable offer to secured creditors would be required to take the companies back into public control using the special administration rules.</p> <p>The cost of nationalisation would run into billions – all of which could be paid for by the issue of government bonds.</p> <p>To raise capital for the future of the publicly owned industry, the public could be offered the chance to buy a bond paying 4% or more in the long term to last for at least 70 years. For the first 15 years the return would be guaranteed by the government, encouraging the public to buy the bonds at scale and fund much of the required investment the industry needs over time.</p> <p>Dieter Helm, a professor of economic policy at Oxford University, says the <a href=\"https://dieterhelm.co.uk/regulation-utilities-infrastructure/time-to-pull-the-plug-on-the-water-privatisation-model/\">privatised industry has “run into the sands”</a> and what is required is systemic change focusing on sustainability, water conservation and a catchment system of regulation to tackle pollution at its source.</p> <p>Helm does not support re-nationalisation, but he does dismiss the often-repeated view that to take water back into public control would cost too much.</p> <p>“The one objection to nationalisation which has little merit is that it would cost the government a lot. This is nonsense,” says Helm. Re-nationalisation, he argues, would involve swapping the regulatory asset-based debt (RAB) for government bonds. “The government would gain the assets and the RABs and swap utility debt for Treasury debt,” he says.</p> <h2><strong>Regulation</strong></h2> <p>McGaughey says the rules that say the regulator, Ofwat, must secure reasonable returns for investors on their capital must be scrapped. Instead, a new social regulator should be set up with duties to ensure bill payers have clean water and sanitary services, communities have clean waterways and beaches, and all future surpluses are invested in upgrading infrastructure.</p> <p>Cat Hobbs, of campaign group We Own It, says the current regulatory system is consistently biased towards investors and the regulator is caught in an impossible bind to meet contradictory and contested interests of investors, end users and the state. The current law says companies need 25 years’ notice for the removal of their licence.</p> <p>“If you were starting from scratch, there’s no way you would start with the privatised system we have in England, geared towards shareholders with our rivers and seas coming as an afterthought. It’s simply not a sensible way to deliver what we need,” she said.</p> <p>What is required are publicly owned water companies with a duty to work with communities to clean up and protect our rivers and seas, she said. Governance structures and regulatory mechanisms must hold them accountable as in countries like Scotland and France.</p> <h2><strong>Sustainability</strong></h2> <p>Population increases, climate change-induced droughts and increases in water demand from data centres mean the pressure on the water system will only rise over the coming decades.</p> <p>A large facility might use anywhere between 4m and 19m litres of water a day for cooling.</p> <p>Without further action there is a one in four chance over the next 30 years that large numbers of households will have their water supply cut off for an extended period because of a severe drought, according to the National Infrastructure Commission.</p> <p>There is a need for more water, but also to reduce water use – currently the average person in England and Wales used 146 litres of water a day. The government wants to cut this to 110 litres a day by 2030.</p> <p>In that context, using drinking water to flush toilets and wash our faces is seen as costly and unsustainable. Helm argues for separation of the system of drinking and wastewater, something dismissed by the government as too expensive – an argument Helm rejects. He argues instead that separation can be done gradually and grey water can be recycled at the household level with localised urban networks built into the system.</p> <p>“At the moment, everyone has access to drinking-water-quality supplies for everything, including watering the garden, cleaning the car and to cool [computing] data hubs,” says Helm. </p> <p>“Imagine if drinking water was for drinking and related uses only, and its use was metered with volume-related charges.</p> <p>“Imagine a world where drinking water was separated from grey water … [and] new houses [had] a water efficiency requirement to store water … [There would be] strong incentives [for] all houses to store water and recycle for gardening and other non-drinking water use because the metered price was high and reflected scarcity over different periods.</p> <p>“It could eventually be real-time pricing … in this imaginary world there would not be a scarcity of water supplies.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The man who was found dead on the Bibby Stockholm barge after it was suspected he had killed himself lay undiscovered for up to 12 hours, his former roommate has claimed.</p> <p>Speaking publicly for the first time since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/18/bibby-stockholm-asylum-seeker-who-died-from-suspected-suicide-is-named\">Leonard Farruku</a>, 27, an asylum seeker from Albania, was found dead in a shower room on the barge last month, Yusuf Deen Kargbo, 20, urged the Home Office to stop using it to accommodate those seeking refugee status.</p> <p>Kargbo, a former Commonwealth Games competitor from Sierra Leone, told the Guardian that Farruku was a “nice and kind man who always smiled and said hello”. He said he and Farruku had shared a room for about a week and a half before his death, which is being investigated by the coroner and the Home Office.</p> <p>“Leonard didn’t speak a lot of English and both of us didn’t spend much time in our rooms during the day,” he said. “But he was friendly and he showed me how to hang up my towels in the shower room. I sometimes saw him watching videos on his phone. I did not know about any mental health problems he might have had.”</p> <p>Farruku’s sister, Jola Dushku, 33, who lives in Lombardy, Italy, told the Guardian her brother had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/02/leonard-farruku-family-bibby-stockholm-crowdfunding\">no known mental health problems</a> before he was put on the barge by the Home Office.</p> <p>She also paid tribute to him. “Leonard was more than a brother to me and our sister. He was a very sympathetic person, he was full of humour and above all he was very straightforward. He had lots of friends in Albania and maintained strong relationships with them. He would never speak about anyone behind their back.”</p> <p>His Home Office identity card, seen by the Guardian, shows he had been granted permission to work just days before his death, due to the fact that his job, thought to be in hospitality, was on the list of shortage occupations.</p> <p>Kargbo said the last time he saw him alive was when he went for his evening meal in the barge dining room. When he returned to his room after dinner and wanted to use the toilet he found the door was locked and assumed Farruku was using the bathroom so went out of the room and used another bathroom.</p> <p>He then went to a different part of the barge where the intermittent wifi signal on board was known to be better and made a long call of about an hour and a half to his home country. Afterwards, he returned to his room, climbed into bed at the top of the bunk he shared with Farruku and fell asleep.</p> <p>He awoke early the next morning at about 5.30am and saw that Farruku’s bed had not been slept in. He then went to the bathroom and once again found the door was locked.</p> <p>“I knocked on the door and kept saying: ‘Hello, hello,’ but I got no answer,” he said. He then raised the alarm with security staff on board.</p> <p>“At first they didn’t take me seriously but after I asked them again they came and had a look. When they got no reply they forced the door open and found Leonard unconscious.”</p> <p>The roommate was swiftly ushered out of the room. “I had a bad feeling about this. The police kept asking me lots of questions and I wasn’t allowed back into my room even to get my clothes or documents,” he said.</p> <p>He said he was offered no support from the Home Office to deal with the trauma he experienced. “Things are very bad on the barge. The biggest fear among the asylum seekers is that the Home Office will remove the barge from its mooring and we will wake up to find we are sailing away to Rwanda. For that reason many people are frightened to go to sleep at night.”</p> <p>Several days after Farruku’s death, the roommate was removed from the barge as a result of intervention by the charity Care4Calais. He has now been moved to hostel accommodation in Cardiff.</p> <p>Kargbo added: “I have been to see the doctor there to get help with my trauma. Another death could happen there at any time. More people will take their lives. Everyone on the barge is so isolated.</p> <p>“I feel so stressed by everything that happened and my anxiety and depression have increased. A lot of the people the Home Office put on the barge are very young like me.”</p> <p>Steve Smith, CEO of Care4Calais, said: “In a caring and compassionate society the trauma of experiencing the suicide of the person you have been told to share a room with would immediately trigger a package of support. Not under this government.</p> <p>“We were appalled that our client spent days on the barge after the suicide, relocated to another room, without his belongings, isolated from others, and without any emotional support. Only the intervention of the legal team with which we had signed him up led to his transfer from the barge.”</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “This was a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with everyone affected. This is being investigated by the police and coroner. We take the welfare of those in our care very seriously, and have rigorous safeguarding processes in place.</p> <p>“Any concerns raised about the service delivered on the barge are swiftly addressed through our work with the provider, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "body" : "<p>The baby milk seller Danone has agreed to cut the wholesale price of its Aptamil infant powdered formula by 7% from Monday after the UK’s competition watchdog launched an investigation into high inflation in the market.</p> <p>The French company, which also owns the Cow &amp; Gate brand, accounts for 71% of the baby formula market in the UK, where manufacturers have been found by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/29/leading-grocery-brands-fuelling-greedflation-uk-regulator-finds\">raised prices by 25% in two years</a>.</p> <p>The price of an 800g pack of Danone’s Aptamil formula went up 26% to about £14.50 between March 2021 and April 2023. The same size pack of Cow &amp; Gate 1 rose 31% according to data compiled by the public health nutrition charity <a href=\"https://www.firststepsnutrition.org/\">First Steps Nutrition Trust</a> (FSNT).</p> <p>Danone’s 7% price cut applies to all its powdered Aptamil formulas sold to UK retailers but not liquid baby milks or any of its Cow &amp; Gate products.</p> <p>Its decision to partly reverse its price rises is likely to put pressure on other major manufacturers to follow suit, including Nestlé, which owns the SMA and Little Steps brands and accounts for about 14% of the UK market.</p> <p>The CMA launched an investigation late last year saying it was concerned that baby formula was vulnerable to higher-than-inflation price rises as parents were nervous of switching brands and only one supermarket own-label alternative existed – from the cut-price chain Aldi.</p> <p>The watchdog found those who do switch brands could save as much as £500 a year by doing so. It added that annual costs could also be being pushed up by manufacturers’ feeding volume guides, which were “systematically higher” than those recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.</p> <p>The supermarket Iceland said it would be cutting the price of three 800g Aptamil powders it sold from £12 to £11.20. Richard Walker, the executive chairman of the retailer’s parent group, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/01/iceland-boss-hits-out-parent-exploitation-baby-milk-market\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/01/iceland-boss-hits-out-parent-exploitation-baby-milk-market\">hit out last month at what he called the “exploitation” of new parents</a>, joining the FSNT in calling for a cap on baby formula prices.</p> <p>He welcomed Danone’s move to reduce the price of Aptamil across the market, adding: “While we support breastfeeding as the most beneficial way of feeding infants, the millions of families who rely on formula need more support for their choice or circumstances and simply reducing the price won’t solve the systemic issues we’ve drawn attention to.”</p> <p>Walker wants changes to the law to allow retailers to promote discounted formula and to allow shoppers to buy it with loyalty points, gift cards or food bank vouchers.</p> <p>The FSNT has called for a price cap and a<strong> </strong>public health campaign that would highlight the nutritional equivalence of all first infant formula, the contents of which is strictly regulated no matter the price or brand.</p> <p>It also wants better enforcement of<strong> </strong>legislation designed to prevent inappropriate marketing of formula milks. Brands currently get around the limits on advertising infant formula by promoting “follow-on milk” – a type of formula targeted at toddlers who do not need a special drink to remain healthy.</p> <p>A Danone UK spokesperson said: “We recognise the challenges faced by parents due to inflation. During this difficult period, we have worked very hard to absorb the significant cost increases we have faced, make savings, and minimise any price increases.”</p> <p>The company said it would continue to engage with the CMA over the coming months adding: “In Danone’s experience the formula milks market is competitive.”</p>",

<p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese,</strong> and the Queensland premier, <strong>Steven Miles,</strong> were in Cairns to announce the additional funding that will further support local

Friday.</p> <p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology there is a low chance of the tropical low strengthening from Sunday into a tropical cyclone.</p> <p>The chance of a cyclone forming depends on the movement of another system west of Darwin called <strong>03U</strong>.</p> <p>A bureau spokesman told AAP:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the other one (03U) doesn’t develop into a tropical cyclone then there is a slightly increased risk the other one in the Gulf (will develop), given there will be more energy in the trough system.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even if it does not form into a cyclone, a tropical low in the Gulf will bring heavy rain to far north regions already reeling from devastating flooding after Jasper hit less than a month ago.</p> <p>“Along coastal parts of the Gulf

that we are entering with climate change.</p> </blockquote> <p>The defence strategic review released in 2023 warned the increasing number of major climate catastrophes risked the government’s capacity to respond effectively, and detracted from “Defence’s primary objective of defending Australia”.</p> <p>It found the climate events were placing concurrent pressures on the ADF that had “negatively affected force preparedness, readiness and combat effectiveness”.</p>    <p>Watt said all options had been consulted on, as the government invested in a nonprofit disaster relief organisation led by veterans.</p> <p>The defence force has increasingly been called on by governments to assist as the nation is battered by repeated extreme flooding and bushfires.</p> <p>The defence review found the

Through a dozen thrush generations the place has become a bigger attraction, a longer draw, each bird benefiting its successors. A dozen clumps of mistletoe two decades ago have become more than 70 today, spread through nine trees. The thrushes have acted as gardeners, either wiping seeds off on a twig, having gorged on the flesh, or depositing them in compost-packed poo. The scientific name <em>Turdus viscivorus</em>, meaning mistletoe-eating thrush, hints strongly at the bird’s all-consuming appetite for those berries.</p> <p>It wants them all, guarding its winter bounty against all comers, though not always successfully. A&nbsp;woodpigeon, a bird never averse to picking unripe fruit, flumps down into the lime, cocks its neck and begins to pluck berries from over its shoulder. The thrush, a few&nbsp;rungs higher, has no time now&nbsp;for honeyed prose. It fires off a long, ugly, and insistent rattling call, a “get off of my crop” warning&nbsp;if ever there was one. The perching pigeon, three or four&nbsp;times its weight, is unmoved. It just&nbsp;keeps eating.</p> <p>• Country diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>",

Nonny! Nonny!” she darts about, searching.</p> <p>As a toddler, my son invented my mother’s grandmother name. His father is of Italian descent and his father’s parents wished to be “Nonna” and “Nonno”. This did not stick. Instead, my mother became “Nonny” and the paternal set of grandparents The Two Nonnies like an Italo-Australian version of the Two Ronnies. Nonny seemed to suit my mother more than her birth name ever had, and in time, everyone began calling her that. With no real effort she’d become someone new.</p> <p>I’d just turned 45 when my granddaughter was born and finding my grandmother name has proved a little tricky. My nanna is still alive, so that name is taken. “Grandma” feels too formal. “Grammy” was snapped up by her grandmother on the other side. Nothing seemed to fit. I procrastinated too long and she began to call me Jessie, which she pronounces “Cheshie”.

We babysit once a week or so, which is an exhausting joy. Even before my granddaughter was crawling, she would raise her arms in the air and squeal with pleasure at the sight of my mother. When Nonny held her, the baby would bring her face close and stare with great intensity into her eyes.</p> <p>“Maybe she’s fascinated by the colour?” my mother offered tentatively. She has unusual, light green eyes. I did not think this was the reason. My granddaughter looked like she was trying to commune with my mother’s soul.

When she toddles around me to reach my mother, my son says, “Don’t give up!” and with a pang I think perhaps I can work harder for her affection. But I know babies are like cats; if you come on too strong, they will spurn you. I stand back and let the soft animal of her body love what it loves.</p> <p>On these babysitting days, as my granddaughter showers my mother with love, I observe. She climbs up next to her on the couch – saying, “cuddle, cuddle” – snuggling in tight against my mother’s body. She sits on her lap and eats her breakfast, food she won’t touch in her own home. She follows her from room to room. If my mother exits without her, she cries until she returns. My mother receives this love with calm equanimity, but I can see she is delighted. She lets the baby come to her, all patient receptivity. I watch this dance and I know it’s a window into how she must have mothered me. The flow between them is deeply familiar; I feel it in my bones.</p> <p>I say, “She’s little, isn’t she?” Both my sons were baby giants and, comparatively, my granddaughter is petite. I was famously tiny as a baby, so I’m fishing for resemblance.</p> <p>“It’s hard to know,” my mother says. “We don’t have any other babies around to compare.”</p> <p>“Her little legs!” I am delighting in her from a distance.</p> <p>“They’re so different from how yours were,” my mother observes. “She’s muscular, whereas you had those tiny calves.”</p> <p>I nod, my scrawny calves still with me.</p> <p>If I close my eyes, I can see my mother, young and lovely, and me, a petite and demanding toddler, issuing my commands: “Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle.” Being delightedly received.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/10/after-i-became-the-oldest-in-my-family-at-24-the-pull-towards-older-people-was-gravitational\">After I became the oldest in my family at 24, the pull towards older people was gravitational | Nadine J Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have lived with my mother most of my life.

I hear it in the stories of my friends. Mothers: overbearing, overanxious, demanding, needy, passive-aggressive, judgmental, neglectful. I have lost count of the number of times someone has uttered, “I could <em>never </em>live with my mother!” And yet, when (and if) we become mothers, we hope that it can be different. That we won’t reenact these patterns. That our children will feel both loved and free.</p> <p>I leave off watching their dance of connection and go to hang out a load of washing. When I return, I can hear my granddaughter crying.</p> <p>“Watch out!” my mother calls, “She’s behind the door.”</p> <p>I open it a crack and she is standing there waiting.</p> <p>“Cheshie!” she says. “Cheshie!”</p> <p>I lift her on to my hip and she snuggles against me.

The great-grandmother – who is known as Amma – struggles to walk far these days but for the past two years she has turned up as often as she can to the school in Uttar Pradesh, alongside her great-granddaughter-in-law, Firdaus, 35, and has learned to read and write.</p> <p>Her enthusiasm for learning has motivated many young girls as well as married women in the area to enrol in school, including two of her daughter-in-laws. As her story has spread across social media, Amma has become a source of inspiration for women across the wider region of Uttar Pradesh, where about 30% of women are illiterate.</p> <p>“I have been going to school for the last two years. I have studied for the most part,” says Amma, grinning as she says she was first attracted to the school by the free lunches that were supplied.</p>    <p>As a child, Amma had no chance of education and was married by the age of 14, two years before India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. With limited opportunities, she worked as a subsistence farmer while raising four sons and a daughter.</p> <p>“There were not many schools in those times,” she says. Her own children received very little education, but as she watched her grandchildren go to school, Amma found herself drawn to learn with them.</p> <p>“The teacher taught me everything,” says Amma. “Now they are saying that they will come to test me in my exams. I went to the school because I like to study and I studied a lot under the guidance of the headteacher. She has taught me a lot of things. I can do the counting and read too.”</p> <p>Her writing is restricted because she has cataracts, says her grandson, Navinoor Khan.</p> <p>“Over time, she has also faced challenges with her hearing and vision, but that hasn’t stopped her from pursuing education,” says Khan, a construction worker who takes his grandmother and his 11-year-old daughter, Afreen, to school each morning.</p> <p>Khan is proud of his grandmother’s impact on the community. “Many girls have been going to school since Amma started attending. There are also about 20 women who go to school sometimes with her.”</p>    <p>Pratibha Sharma, the headteacher at Chawli primary school, says she believes Amma’s example can help improve adult literacy rates in the region. It was Sharma who encouraged Amma to enrol after she started coming to school for lunch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jul/13/the-indian-girls-movement-fighting-child-marriage\">‘We can do anything’: the Indian girls’ movement fighting child marriage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“A free midday meal is cooked in the school and since the economic condition of Amma is not good, she used to come to the school to ask what was being prepared.

Her oral learning is good,” says Sharma. “This recognition of different learning abilities emphasises the inclusivity and flexibility required in education in our country, which we sometimes find lacking.”</p> <p>Amma has now taken the national literacy exam and – if she passes – she will gain a certificate that that will place her among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/14/india-faces-deepening-demographic-divide-as-it-prepares-to-overtake-china-as-the-worlds-most-populous-country\">India’s growing literate population</a>.</p> <p>“We hope she qualifies,” says Sharma. “People in the village have hopes that she will continue to inspire all of us to tread the path of learning, come what may.”</p>",

It’s a programme with a&nbsp;Hobbesian view of human nature built into its premise; it works only if people will betray each other when a “life-changing” amount of money is dangled in front of their eyes. Play fair? Stick to the plan? “The&nbsp;world doesn’t work that way,” says one contestant, grimly.</p> <p>The size of the prize pot and the lengths people are asked to go to for it is very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/nov/20/squid-game-the-challenge-review-netflix\">Squid Game: The Challenge</a>. The setting is a mixture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/11/love-is-blind-review-netflix-the-return-of-the-dating-show-you-cant-take-your-eyes-off\">Love Is Blind</a>, Love Island and Survivor, as is the “trust ceremony”, in which contestants must tell Baldwin whether they will vote someone out of the house – thus increasing their share of the pot – or refuse to do so. They live together for the duration, as on Big Brother, which leads to rapid bonding and talk of how they will always love each other and will always be a family, even after a mere 24&nbsp;hours together.</p> <p>Of course, its closest relative is The Traitors. The&nbsp;Trust is like a bootleg handbag version of the hit show, where the font is the same, but the brand name is “Traytors” and the zip comes off when you touch it. They sit around a table, arguing about whether they will vote and who deserves to go. Then they head to the&nbsp;top of a cliff and, when they are alone, do&nbsp;everything they said they wouldn’t do.</p>    <p>Like The Traitors, The Trust proves that people are terrible at reading other people. Assumptions are made about who is trustworthy and who isn’t. They get themselves embroiled in the dead-certain logic of reality TV, which unravels when you take a second to think about it. “We can’t all make it to the end,” says one contestant, gravely. You literally can! That was explained at the outset of the show! It’s one of the fundamental rules of the game!</p> <p>As with The Traitors, this is reality TV in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/dec/17/normcore-spoof-marketing-term-fashion-phenomenon\">normcore era</a>, where not everyone looks like a model and producers have realised the value of putting people over 35 with opinions on screen. However, this is a US production, so its brushstrokes are bigger, broader and cruder. One contestant declares himself to&nbsp;be “1,000% honest”, upping the percentage stakes with gusto. </p> <p>But it sacrifices wit and warmth for drama. It has been cast with conflict in mind. There isn’t so much a villain edit, in which one player is singled out for the baddie treatment, as a villain sweep; it’s hard to&nbsp;get behind anyone. It’s a game of greed, after all.</p> <p>This is a devious competition, then, in which people mostly stab each other in the back. It’s very good at conjuring up shock-horror-gasp moments of betrayal and bad behaviour. Baldwin’s presence suggests that more news reporters should be sent into the fray of reality TV. She asks smart and direct questions, taking it all more seriously than it deserves to be taken. It leaves me wondering if Emily Maitlis should be looking&nbsp;for her next gig at Casa Amor.</p> <p>But there is an ickiness to The Trust that something like The Traitors simply doesn’t possess. People come into it with traumatic backstories that seem far too awful to be called upon in this sort of environment. Hearing about people’s genuine pain adds an unpleasantly sour note to the “life’s not fair” thrust of&nbsp;what is ultimately a silly TV competition.</p> <p>Still, it’s gripping, if gruesomely so. The Traitors is only on three nights a week, after all.</p> <p>• The Trust: A Game of Greed is on Netflix now.</p>",
