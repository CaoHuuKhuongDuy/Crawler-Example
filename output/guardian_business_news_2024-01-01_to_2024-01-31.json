            "body" : "<p>Mike Lynch, the technology tycoon once lauded as the UK’s answer to Bill Gates and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/12/autonomy-founder-mike-lynch-extradited-to-us-after-losing-appeal\">facing criminal fraud charges in the US</a>, is suing the Serious Fraud Office.</p> <p>Lynch, who was extradited to the US last year to face trial over allegations he duped Hewlett-Packard into overpaying when it struck an $11bn (£8.6bn) deal to buy his software firm Autonomy in 2011, has filed a data protection claim against the SFO in the high court in London.</p> <p>Details of the case have yet to be made public but Lynch, whose trial in the US is due to start on 18 March, has hired the law firm Pallas Partners to pursue the legal action against the director of the SFO, Nick Ephgrave. A spokesperson for Lynch declined to comment on the case.</p> <p>After the Autonomy deal, Hewlett-Packard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/20/hewlett-packard-autonomy-improprieties-writedown\">took an $8.8bn writedown in the firm’s value</a> after discovering what it called “serious accounting improprieties”, blaming Lynch for perpetrating a $5bn fraud, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/15/hp-lynch-autonomy-writedown\">an accusation he denies</a>.</p> <p>In 2022, Lynch lost a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/hewlett-packard-wins-civil-case-against-mike-lynch-over-autonomy-sale\">six-year civil fraud case in the UK</a>, with the high court judge ruling that HP had been induced into overpaying for the takeover because of fraud perpetrated by Lynch and Autonomy’s former finance director Sushovan Hussain, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/13/ex-autonomy-cfo-sushovan-hussain-five-years-hewlett-packard\">is in jail in the US</a> after being found guilty of fraud relating to the same deal.</p> <p>Lynch has now been charged by the US government with 17 counts of fraud over the deal, which enriched the billionaire by about $800m.</p> <p>The SFO opened an investigation into Autonomy and Lynch in 2013 but ended it in 2015, saying there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction of the software firm’s former executive. The SFO then ceded jurisdiction over aspects of the case to US authorities.</p> <p>Evidence provided by the SFO, which was also at one time an Autonomy customer, has been used in the US case against Lynch. The SFO deal with Autonomy is one of dozens of deals that US prosecutors have said they intend to use as evidence.</p> <p>The SFO has refused Lynch’s request for the data which has prompted the legal action.</p> <p>Anthony Hanratty, a senior associate at the law firm Withers, said: “During UK extradition proceedings, a lawyer for the SFO provided a statement of belief to the court that the UK was not the most appropriate forum for the prosecution, although the SFO had previously investigated the matter before ceding control to the US, citing evidential issues.” </p> <p>Hanratty added: “Access to any material relating to the defendant which was the basis for such a decision could result in valuable evidence being obtained which would not ordinarily be disclosed during the trial process<em>.”</em></p> <p>The SFO says it did not oppose Lynch’s extradition to the US for reasons including that it was practical for all the prosecutions to take place in one jurisdiction, where HP is based.</p> <p>Lynch, who has pleaded not guilty and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, is now under house arrest in San Francisco.</p> <p>After landing in the US, Lynch was accompanied by the United States Marshals Service and a court ordered him to pay a $100m bond and called in 24-hour armed guards, deeming the billionaire to be a flight risk.</p>",

In a statement, the Fed said the factors behind its goals for inflation and employment were “moving into better balance”.</p> <p>It comes as price rises are easing, unemployment remains low and economic growth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/25/us-economic-growth-slowdown-gdp-report\">remains largely resilient</a>, raising hopes that the Fed will guide the world’s largest economy to a so-called “soft landing”, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided.</p> <p>Powell has cautioned that a declaration of victory would be premature. “Inflation is still too high, the ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain,” he told reporters on Wednesday.</p> <p>The central bank has held rates between 5.25% and 5.5% since July. After this week’s meeting, it said its rate-setting policy committee “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%”.</p> <p>It is trying to strike a delicate balance: moving “too soon or too much” on rates could reverse progress on inflation, Powell observed, but “too late and too little” action would risk knocking the economy.</p> <p>Inflation has weakened. The consumer price index, which peaked above 9% in June 2022, stood at 3.4% in December, according to official data. But many Americans are still grappling with the heightened cost of living, and price growth remains above the Fed’s 2% target.</p> <p>Fed officials will closely scrutinize employment data for January, due out on Friday. The US economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/05/us-economy-inflation-jobs-report-december\">added 2.7m jobs last year</a>, defying fears of a downturn in the face of the Fed’s aggressive campaign against inflation.</p> <p>Wall Street came under pressure after Wednesday’s announcement. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.8% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%.</p> <p>At a press conference, Powell noted that “almost every” Fed policymaker believes it will be appropriate to reduce rates later this year.</p> <p>“We feel like inflation is coming down, growth has been strong, the labor market has been strong,” he said. “What we are trying to do is identify a place where we are really confident about inflation getting back down to 2%, so we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level [of rates].”</p> <p>The central bank is scheduled to hold its next rate-setting meeting in March. Powell all but knocked down the prospect of a rate cut so soon. “I don’t think it’s likely the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to lower rates,” he said, “but that’s to be seen.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>“Was the world’s richest man overpaid?” begins Kathaleen McCormick in her ruling from the Delaware court of chancery. You bet. An incentive package worth up to $55.8bn for Elon Musk at Tesla in 2018 was over the top, unnecessary to secure the great man’s services and thus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-too-much-judge-rules\">“unfair” to other shareholders</a> because of the dilutive effect on their holdings. Read <a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=359340\">the 200-page judgment</a> and it’s hard to disagree with any step in her argument.</p> <p>Musk and his fanclub are enraged, naturally. “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,” said Tesla’s chief executive. And it’s true that shareholders approved the scheme by a 73% majority back in 2018. Some said on Musk’s X that they’d happily do so again today because he hit his performance-related targets and Tesla’s value improved by a turbo-charged $600bn. (Back in 2018, remember, the electric vehicle company was worth $50bn-ish and there was a lively debate in the investment world about whether it would soon run out of money.)</p> <p>Yet the objection that shareholders signed off the whole thing misses the nuances, and careful stages, in McCormick’s ruling. Step one was to show that Musk’s 22% stake in Tesla gave him controlling status, meaning enormous influence. That wasn’t hard to show: Musk was chairman and “superstar CEO” and “enjoyed thick ties with directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla”.</p> <p>Step two was to ask, given the controlling status, whether the incentive package was fair. Delaware courts can shift the burden of proof when a transaction is approved by a “fully informed” vote of other shareholders, but that’s where Tesla and the defendants started to fall down. The company’s proposal “inaccurately described key directors as independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process”.</p> <p>The judge is surely spot-on about the lack of independence. Ira Ehrenpreis, the lead director negotiating for Tesla, had a 15-year business relationship with Musk. Another member of the working group, Antonio Gracias, had a 20-year one and regularly went on holiday with Musk’s family. A third member was the company’s general counsel, Todd Maron, who was Musk’s former divorce lawyer and “whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition”. That set-up just looks too cosy.</p> <p>It was also a reason why McCormick concluded that the process behind the award was “deeply flawed”. In essence, Musk proposed the size and structure of his potential rewards and the compensation committee achieved concessions that weren’t true concessions in the judge’s view.</p> <p>Thus the argument moved on to the fairness of the award in terms of price. The board members argued that they wanted to set Tesla up for transformational growth and that Musk’s continued leadership was essential. McCormick knocked down the “high level” appeal of that argument with a series of commonsense points. First, given Musk’s one-fifth stake, he already had “every incentive” to attempt transformation because a $50bn increase in Tesla’s market value would be worth $10bn to him. Second, he had no plan to leave. Third, the incentive scheme didn’t even require him to devote a set amount of time to Tesla.</p> <p>“Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside’, or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8bn question: was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” asked the judge. Yes, that’s the nub of it. In being so lavish, the directors short-changed ordinary shareholders.</p> <p>The court order says the share options must be voided. Tesla may appeal or produce a new proposal (with correct disclosures on independence, one hopes). In the meantime, though, applaud a judgment that injects a dose of sanity into the process of awarding executive rewards at quoted companies – a process that has become so inflationary, in part, because independent directors have taken timidity to new depths.</p> <p>“When seeking directors, CEOs don’t look for pit bulls. It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home,” another rich man, <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2019ar/2019ar.pdf\">Warren Buffett, said a few years ago</a>. Absolutely right. The job of independent director is meant to be about representing the interests of all shareholders. If you can’t act independently, you should not be there. Do not behave like members of a cult, which is roughly what happened at Tesla. Come on – $55.8bn was always absurd.</p>",

The German-owned discounter Aldi overtook Morrisons to become the UK’s fourth largest grocer in 2022.</p> <p>“We are developing plans to reinvigorate, refresh and strengthen Morrisons and to start a new chapter,” said Baitiéh, the former head of the France’s Carrefour chain who has a reputation as a turnaround expert.</p> <p>“Since the pandemic, Morrisons has not been on peak form. Our market share has slipped slowly and consistently and [underlying] sales have been below the pack for a while,” he said.</p> <p>Under a new regime intended to draw back shoppers, Baitiéh said Morrisons would not have any major meetings without the presence of a customer panel that could offer insights into where it could improve.</p> <p>The customers will give views on pricing, service and products at the chain asking questions of management, and being asked their opinions by executives.</p> <p>Baitiéh said the voice of store managers would also be given more emphasis within the business to gain insight from the shop floor. He said all stores would have monthly shopper roundtables and those that were particularly “challenged” would host one every week.</p> <p>“We are beginning to have a new mindset in the company, a high performance culture,” he said.</p> <p>Baitiéh said there was “work to do” on improving quality, price, ranges and profit margins, but he was “confident that Morrisons has the people, the talent, the assets and the desire to chart a bright future in UK grocery”.</p> <p>Morrisons said on Wednesday that sales had risen 3.3% in the three months to the end of October 2023 on the same period a year earlier – well behind the rate of inflation.</p> <p>The UK’s fifth largest grocer, which has about 500 supermarkets, said its pace of growth had improved throughout last year so that total sales rose 2.7% to £14.9bn in the year to the end of October.</p> <p>Underlying sales growth, which excludes the impact of store openings and closures, rose 1.8% for the year, indicating a fall in the amount of goods sold as food price inflation was more than 5% throughout the year.</p> <p>Annual underlying profits rose 6.5% to £970m, but that figure does not include interest payments on Morrisons’ debts of about £5.5bn, which are thought to top £400m a year.</p> <p>The chief financial officer, Joanna Goff, said the group had produced a pre-tax profit, before exceptional costs and benefits but declined to give an exact figure. She said the figure was an improvement on the previous year, when the company made a £1.5bn pre-tax loss after finance costs of £593m.</p> <p>The company said it had raised £450m during the year from the sale and leaseback of assets, including its warehouses, and generated more than £540m of cash.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the group sold off its petrol forecourts business to sister company MFG for £2.5bn. The deal will hand Morrisons almost £2bn and Goff said the “vast majority” of that would go towards reducing the company’s debt pile, which would in turn reduce interest payments, freeing up cash to invest in prices, ranges and improved stores.</p> <p>The deal also leaves Morrisons with a 20% stake in MFG and Baitiéh said a plan to install electric car charging points alongside the petrol forecourts near Morrisons stores would help attract shoppers.</p> <p>About 2,000 workers from the petrol forecourts will also return to Morrisons’ main stores as part of the deal. The forecourts will be run by franchisees.</p> <p>There had been rumours that the business was considering selling off its food-processing arm, which includes 18 facilities including vegetable packhouses and abattoirs, in order to raise further cash amid rising interest rates on its debts.</p> <p>However, Baitiéh said that division was central to his plans for the group and gave it a “competitive advantage” against rivals, which did not have equivalent facilities. He said he wanted to make that part of the group more efficient and innovative and highlight its benefits more to shoppers.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Businesses across the UK have been forced to pay an extra 10% on average for their gas and electricity because suppliers routinely add third-party broker commissions to their bills, according to a leading litigation law firm.</p> <p>Thousands of small businesses have joined a group legal action, led by the law firm Harcus Parker, to claw back up to £2bn in undisclosed broker fees added to their energy bills.</p> <p>The commissions, which can in the most extreme cases be 60% of the energy costs, have heaped pressure on small companies already struggling to cope with the surge in energy prices caused by Russia throttling gas supplies to Europe after the invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>The law firm claims that more than a million small businesses may have been forced to pay inflated prices over the past decade because suppliers include in the bill the “secret” fees or commissions charged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/25/energy-brokers-small-firms-commissions\">the energy brokers that market their deals</a>. Customer bills often do not disclose that a fee has been added or the level at which it has been charged.</p> <p>Damon Parker, a partner at Harcus Parker, said: “We’ve examined thousands of bills for customers joining our claim and it’s been quite shocking, in percentage terms, how much these secret commissions have added to their bills.”</p> <p>The fees piled on to energy bills to pay broker commissions are typically about 1.7p per unit of energy, which often costs around 10p per unit, according to Harcus Parker. On average, the law firm claims, broker fees add about 10% to the total energy bill for small businesses using a broker service.</p>    <p>Energy suppliers are under increased scrutiny over their relationship with unregulated third-party brokers that target small business owners. Business groups have said that brokers have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/23/trade-groups-demand-ofgem-tackle-energy-brokers-ripping-off-small-firms\">free to “rip off” companies, charities, care homes and faith groups</a> by piling billions of pounds in hidden commission fees on to bills.</p> <p>The Federation of Small Businesses has also claimed that brokers have locked thousands of companies into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/07/edf-and-british-gas-offer-lower-rates-for-small-businesses-trapped-in-contracts\">poor-value long-term energy deals</a> fixed when global market prices were at their peak, meaning they will be forced to pay above the odds even as energy market prices have come down.</p> <p>Harcus Parker has called on the energy regulator to force suppliers to come clean on the fees they pass on to their customers. Since October 2022, it has been mandatory for suppliers to disclose these charges to all “microbusiness” customers – those with a turnover of less than £1.8m or fewer than 10 employees – but small businesses that are slightly larger do not have the same protections.</p> <p>“People see a figure of 1p or 2p per unit and think nothing of it, but if this amounts to thousands of pounds over the course of a fixed contract, that [would] really help open customers’ eye,” Parker said.</p> <p>“We’ve been calling on Ofgem to make these broker costs transparent for all non-domestic energy customers for nearly a year, and we’re delighted that they’ve finally listened. That said, others were raising this issue of secret commissions 10 years ago, so I’m not sure why it has taken so long.</p> <p>“It seems some brokers were more interested in getting themselves the highest amount of commission possible than getting the customer the best financial deal.”</p> <p>“We think a lump sum amount of how much brokers’ commissions will cost companies and organisations will add another layer of transparency.”</p> <p>The law firm’s findings come on the day that Ofgem closes a consultation on plans to force major energy companies to disclose the rates they add to bills to cover broker fees.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ofgem said: “After listening to concerns from businesses, Ofgem consulted on changes to supply licence conditions to require full transparency on how much is paid to energy brokers for securing a contract with the customer.</p> <p>“Ofgem has asked government to introduce regulation of energy brokers, who fall outside our remit. While this is considered, we are working to ensure that customers are properly informed and protected with appropriate regulation on energy suppliers.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The boss of Tata Steel has defended his decision to make thousands of workers redundant at Port Talbot, denying an accusation that £500m in government support represented “the deal of the century” for the company.</p> <p>TV Narendran, Tata Steel’s global chief executive, told MPs on Wednesday that the decision to close two blast furnaces at the south Wales site was driven by steep losses at the steelworks, which he said came to £160m in the last quarter.</p> <p>Tata Steel this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/19/port-talbot-steelworks-blast-furnaces-to-close-costing-almost-3000-jobs-tata\">announced the blast furnaces would close</a> by the end of summer, to be replaced by a new electric arc furnace part-funded by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/15/tata-steel-seals-500m-uk-support-package-but-big-job-losses-feared\">£500m government subsidy</a>. The company said the decision would affect 2,500 jobs at Port Talbot and a further 300 at another south Wales site, in Llanwern.</p> <p>The switch will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/15/welsh-steelworks-at-breaking-point-over-the-cost-of-cleaning-up-its-act\">dramatically reduce carbon emissions</a>, but will require far fewer workers, dealing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/19/port-talbot-anger-over-tata-steel-decision-close-furnaces\">devastating blow to the town</a>, whose economy and community is dominated by the steelworks. Welsh steelworkers protested against the blast furnace closure outside parliament on Wednesday.</p>    <p>Narendran told a hearing of parliament’s Welsh affairs committee that the government would not consider covering the UK company’s losses and that shareholders in the Indian-listed parent group had grown weary over the billions of pounds spent on the plant during 15 years of ownership.</p> <p>Stephen Crabb, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: “We have a plan now which doesn’t save blast furnaces, doesn’t save jobs in Port Talbot, and you’ve managed to get UK government to give £500m for it. I mean, that must be the deal of the century for you?”</p> <p>Unions at the hearing criticised Tata’s decision. Community, GMB and Unite have all called for the blast furnaces to be kept open for longer. Alasdair McDiarmid, Community’s assistant general secretary, said: “The focus has been on price, rather than what’s best for the country, the industry and the workforce.”</p> <p>Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said that “Tata must change direction” and wait for a Labour government; the party has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/24/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-the-steel-industry-how-to-forge-a-better-future\">promised about £2bn in extra funding</a> for UK steel on top of the £1bn under discussion with Tata and the Chinese-owned British Steel. Narendran said Tata needed more detail on Labour’s plans.</p> <p>The hearing took place in a room named after Margaret Thatcher, who closed large parts of the UK’s steel industry in 1980 and privatised the rest. </p> <p>The Tata decision, along with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/06/british-steel-scunthorpe-furnaces-jobs#:~:text=2%20months%20old-,British%20Steel%20to%20replace%20Scunthorpe%20furnaces%2C%20putting,to%202%2C000%20jobs%20at%20risk&amp;text=British%20Steel%20has%20announced%20a,of%20up%20to%202%2C000%20steelworkers.\">similar plan by British Steel to close blast furnaces at Scunthorpe</a>, will represent a new era for the UK as it will leave the country unable to produce steel from iron ore for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. Tata’s plan for Port Talbot instead relies on using scrap steel from the UK, which is mostly exported.</p> <p>Narendran confirmed that the company would consider investment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/28/tata-steel-open-to-more-uk-investment-despite-port-talbot-job-cuts\">direct reduced iron (DRI)</a> technology that could produce net zero iron from ore. DRI could be used with an electric arc furnace and would create hundreds of jobs, although not enough to counterbalance the thousands lost from the blast furnace closures.</p> <p>Narendran said the company would invest in DRI technology only if it could guarantee a good supply of, at first, methane and then zero-emissions hydrogen. He said the Netherlands, where Tata is building a DRI plant, had a supply of methane gas that was lacking in the UK, but MPs on the committee questioned whether the company could use existing gas supplies piped through south Wales from a terminal on the west coast.</p> <p>Narendran said: “At a later stage if there is an availability of a lot of gas in Port Talbot and at whatever price … then we can certainly look at setting up a DRI plant in Port Talbot.”</p>",

RSV, a common respiratory virus, can lead to hospitalisation and death in older adults.</p> <p>GSK has upgraded its outlook and now estimates it can deliver more than £38bn of sales by 2031, compared with its previous forecast of £33bn. It now expects to reach its original 2031 goal by 2026.</p> <p>The vaccine, called Arexvy, was launched in the US in the autumn. It was approved in the UK in July but is not available on the NHS yet. GSK remains in discussions with government. The shot can be bought privately at pharmacies and private clinics.</p> <p>Asked about vaccination rates, Walmsley said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will take a few years to get there, to get to the kind of the flu rates which are closer to 60%.</p> <p>And in the UK, we do have the vaccine approved privately. What we’re looking forward to is to be able to get to national immunisation programmes.</p> <p>The absolute key is this is a fantastic return on investment for any government because it keeps people out of hospital, it creates capacity in GP surgeries. It increases participation in the workforce which actively drives productivity for the country. So we know that every pound or dollar spent on vaccination is very, very well spent even before you talk about the benefits to patients.</p> <p>We’ve been having very positive discussions with the government and we’re hoping to bring this to the UK public as soon as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The GSK share price is down 1.2% at £15.19 today, but has risen nearly 10% in the past six months.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-31T10:07:43.610Z\">at 10.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-65ba0dd88f084c050ec26044\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-31T09:10:24.101Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">French inflation eases faster than expected to 3.1%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Inflation in France has eased faster than expected.</p> <p>It came in at 3.1% in January compared with 3.7% in December, according to INSEE, the French statistics office. </p> <p>January’s figures are weaker than those forecast by INSEE in mid-December. The fall in inflationary pressure is particularly marked for energy (up by 1.8% year-on-year, compared with 5.7% in December), but also for food (+5.7% year-on-year, compared with +7.2% in December) and manufactured goods, where prices are virtually stable compared with January 2023 (+0.7% year-on-year, compared with +1.4% in December). </p> <p><strong>Charlotte de Montpellier</strong>, senior economist for France and Switzerland at ING, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is clearly a move in the right direction, which should be greeted with relief by the European Central Bank. On the other hand, the rise in services prices was stronger in January, at 3.2% compared with 3.1% the previous month.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the leading indicators suggest that inflation in France will continue to fall over the coming months, although not necessarily continuously. In particular, the contribution of energy to inflation is likely to rise again in the coming months, due to a less favourable base effect for petroleum product prices and the end of various government support mechanisms for energy bills…</p> <p>Ultimately, we expect inflation to remain close to 3% for the first part of the year, before gradually easing towards 2% in the second half and remaining close to that level in 2025.

Turnover rose 5% to £30.3bn. It made sales of £8.05bn in the final quarter of the year.</p> <p><strong>Emma Walmsley</strong>’s strategy is focused on vaccines, infectious diseases and HIV drugs, with further acquisitions likely to boost the firm’s pipeline of new medicines. GSK has 71 vaccines and specialty medicines in clinical development, including 18 in late stage trials.</p> <p>Its Arexvy vaccine for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can be serious for children and elderly people, was the first approved RSV vaccine for older adults in May when the US regulator approved it. </p> <p>The jab has become a blockbuster (with more than $1bn annual sales) and has outshone US rival Pfizer’s shot Abrysvo. More than a fifth of adults over 60 in the US have been vaccinated with either jab so far.</p> <p>GSK is attempting to lower the age threshold from 60 to 50. The RSV vaccine was launched in the US last autumn and has an estimated two-thirds market share, with sales of more than £1.2bn so far. </p> <p>It brought in sales of £529m between October and December, while GSK’s shingles vaccine Shingrix generated £908m.</p> <p>Walmsley said clear highlights in 2023 were the “exceptional launch of Arexvy and continued progress in our pipeline”.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are now planning for at least 12 major launches from 2025, with new vaccines and specialty medicines for infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory and oncology. As a result of this progress and momentum, we expect to deliver another year of meaningful sales and earnings growth in 2024, and we are upgrading our growth outlooks for 2026 and 2031. We remain focused on delivering this potential - and more - to prevent and change the course of disease for millions of people.</p> </blockquote>    <p><strong>Richard Hunter</strong>,<strong> </strong>head of markets at interactive investor,<strong> </strong>said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>GSK has delivered a reminder that it remains a serious player on the global stage, with successful product launches being followed by a strong pipeline of potential new drugs.</p> <p>The long-term potential of the sector is not in question, as moves towards personalised medicine and growing middle classes in emerging markets provide possibilities for endless demand. Meanwhile, the move away from the “white pills and Western markets” model , a phrase which Glaxo coined some years ago, is translating into a more specialised business, which was confirmed by the spin-off of its consumer healthcare unit Haleon in 2022.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-31T08:34:30.655Z\">at 8.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-65b9f29c8f084c050ec25f8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-31T07:51:36.274Z\">7.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Shadow chancellor Reeves rules out reinstating bankers' bonus cap</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the shadow chancellor, has said that Labour will not reinstate a cap on bankers’ bonuses that was scrapped lat year by the Conservative government.</p> <p>In a big shift from previous Labour policies, she set out Labour’s plans to boost economic growth through financial services, which she described as one of the UK’s greatest assets that the party will “unashamedly champion”. </p> <p>Bankers’ bonuses were capped at 200% of their regular pay across the EU to deter the excessive risk taking that many say caused the financial crisis.</p> <p>The short-lived Liz Truss government abandoned the bonus cap.

Compared with January last year, prices were down just 0.2%, following an annual decline of 1.8% in December. It was the smallest annual drop in a year.</p> <p><strong>Robert Gardner</strong>, Nationwide’s chief economist, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have been some encouraging signs for potential buyers recently with mortgage rates continuing to trend down. This follows a shift in view amongst investors around the future path of Bank rate, with investors becoming more optimistic that the Bank of England will lower rates in the years ahead.</p> <p>These shifts are important as this led to a decline in the longer-term interest rates (swap rates) that underpin mortgage pricing around the turn of the year. However, the partial reversal in recent weeks in response to stronger than expected inflation and activity data cautions that the interest rate outlook remains highly uncertain.</p> <p>While a rapid rebound in activity or house prices in 2024 appears unlikely, the outlook is looking a little more positive. The most recent RICS survey suggests the decline in new buyer enquiries has halted, while there are tentative signs of a pickup in the number of properties coming onto the market.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank of England is expected to keep its base rate at 5.25% on Thursday but may lower some of its inflation forecasts, which could give it room to start cutting rates from the summer.</p> <p>Denmark’s <strong>Novo Nordisk</strong> has reported strong revenue growth, with sales of its obesity and diabetes drugs soaring. Obesity drug sales alone jumped 154% at constant exchange rates to 41.6bn Danish kroner (£4.8bn) last year, fuelled by demand for Wegovy. Sales of diabetes drugs such as Ozempic grew by 52%, and obesity and diabetes sales together totalled 215bn kroner (nearly £25bn).</p> <p>Overall sales rose 36% to 232bn kroner, while profit before tax jumped 52% to 104.7bn kroner.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/05/weight-loss-novo-nordisk-wegovy-uk\">The company has struggled to keep up with demand</a> and is building more factories.</p> <p>For 2024, sales growth is expected to be 18-26% at constant exchange rates, and operating profit growth is expected to be 21-29%.</p> <p><strong>Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen</strong>, president and chief executive, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments.</p> <p>Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/06/will-weight-loss-drugs-kill-the-fast-food-business\">Will weight loss drugs kill the fast food business?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blockbuster anti-obesity drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy appear to dampen inflammation — raising hope that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00118-4\">they could be used to treat diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s</a>, that are characterised by brain inflammation, according to the journal Nature.</p> <p><strong>The Agenda</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>7.45am GMT: France inflation for January (previous: 3.7%)</p></li> <li><p>8.55am GMT: Germany unemployment for January (forecast: 11,000)</p></li> <li><p>1pm GMT: Germany inflation for January (forecast: 3%, previous: 3.7%)</p></li> <li><p>7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision (forecast: no change)</p></li> <li><p>7.30pm GMT: Fed press conference</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2024-01-31T09:35:40.214Z\">at 9.35am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

And as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.”</p> \n<p>Labour said on Tuesday that it planned to cut swathes of red tape in the financial services sector, while “unashamedly championing” the industry.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/30/labour-vows-to-cut-financial-red-tape-and-unashamedly-champion-uk-sector\">In a 24-page document</a>, seen by the Guardian, Labour has promised to cut down 10,000 pages of regulations and ruled out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/19/uk-banks-prepare-for-windfall-tax-as-hunt-moves-to-plug-40bn-hole-in-public-finances\">windfall tax on bank profits</a>.</p> \n<p>Reeves defended the move, insisting it was not about watering down protection for consumers or the UK’s financial stability.</p> \n<p>Labour will formally announce its plans to harness the strengths of the financial sector to City bosses at its business conference in London on Thursday.</p> \n<p>To counter the growing support across industry and the City for Labour’s pro-business stance, Sunak has recruited chief executives from some of the UK’s largest companies to advise him and “help drive the government’s growth agenda”.</p> \n<p>The prime minister said a number of bosses from a wide range of industries would attend a new business council, including the chief executives of BT, Nationwide, Unilever and Greggs.</p> \n<p>Sunak said: “Coming from a small business family, I know how integral business is to communities and the wider economy. Without the jobs, growth, and innovation created by UK firms, the country simply wouldn’t function.</p> \n<p>“That’s why I’m getting businesses in for a regular update on how well we are doing in delivering for business – straight from the shop floor.”</p>",

Passenger numbers on the tube were down 10% from last Tuesday with many rail commuters unable to reach the capital, according to figures from Transport for London.</p> <p>Both Northern and TPE have warned customers not to attempt to travel on Wednesday as no services will run, including on TPE’s routes into Scotland. An overtime ban that started on Monday across all the operators in England is also expected to bring more short-notice cancellations to services and potential disruption until next Tuesday.</p> <p>While the government hoped that its recently passed anti-strike laws would push train operators to enforce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/30/why-minimum-service-law-not-being-used-england-train-strikes\">minimum service levels</a> (MSLs) this week, none have attempted to deploy the powers. LNER, one of the four state-run operators, was faced with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/18/lner-train-drivers-strike-february-aslef\">five additional days</a> of strikes after tentatively starting the process, until it withdrew plans to enforce the strike-busting law.</p> <p>Unions have said that MSLs are unworkable. However, Downing Street piled on pressure this week by claiming that they were “a key tool that train operators themselves have asked for to reduce the impact of disruption on passengers. They should now use them”.</p> <p>Train operators, however, told House of Commons hearings last year that they had no clarity over how they should be used. A senior rail industry source said it was not true that operators had lobbied for the anti-strike powers – a Conservative manifesto pledge – and instead had warned that they were likely to exacerbate industrial unrest.</p> <p>Further strikes will follow at LNER, Greater Anglia and C2C on Friday. No trains will run across West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast and East Midlands Railway during strikes on Saturday.</p> <p>The overtime ban’s impact is likely to peak on Sunday, reducing timetables at a number of operators which rely on voluntary rest day working. The last strikes will take place at Great Western, CrossCountry and Chiltern on Monday.</p> <p>The pay dispute affects train operators in England contracted to the Department for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport\">Transport</a> (DfT), although the industrial action will also affect some cross-border services to Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, has advised passengers to check before they travel throughout the week.</p> <p>Aslef has warned it will continue strikes until there are further negotiations on a pay deal. It said some drivers were now approaching five years without a pay rise, after working through the pandemic.</p> <p>The RDG said Aslef should stop calling “damaging industrial action” and work with them to resolve the dispute and make “the changes needed to make services more reliable”.</p> <p>Huw Merriman, the rail minister, said: “Passengers are being targeted by Aslef’s decision to go on strike, despite union bosses having an offer on the table that would take train drivers’ average salary up to £65,000 for a four-day week.</p> <p>“While the RMT [National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers], TSSA [Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association] and Unite have all agreed deals for their members, Aslef’s leadership isn’t even putting the fair offer on the table to a vote of their members.”</p>",

The 16.2% increase from a year earlier was the most since the March quarter of 2001, the ABS said.</p> \n<p>The RBA had forecast in November that inflation would end 2023 at an annual rate of 4.5%. Prior to today’s CPI figures, investors saw minimal chance the central bank would lift its cash rate from 4.35% when its board meets for the first time this year next Monday and Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Attention is instead focusing on how soon the RBA will start cutting interest rates if it becomes confident inflation will drop back within its 2-3% target range before the end of next year. The trimmed mean measure of inflation that strips out more volatile movers was up 4.2% in the quarter from a year earlier.</p> \n<p>Retail sales figures for December out on Tuesday showed turnover was just 0.8% higher than a year earlier, implying spending sank once inflation was deducted and underscoring weakness in the economy. Excluding the Covid lockdown periods, retail growth was the weakest since July 2000, the Commonwealth Bank said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7536c787-ae95-49de-9c23-99f3c17784a6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PM6R2y9Ch9Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The dollar fell about 0.2 US cents to 65.8 US cents and the Australian share market added about 0.25% as investors trimmed their bets for any more interest rate rises, with the ASX200 share index later rising to a record high.</p> \n<p>The EY chief economist, Cherelle Murphy, said the inflation data showed the RBA’s 13 rate rises since May 2022 had worked and there was “no reason to lift the cash rate next week”.</p> \n<p>However, mortgage holders will likely have to remain patient about early rate cuts. “Domestic sources of inflationary pressures are still present – including continued strong demand for housing, rising insurance premiums and a tight labour market,” Murphy said.</p> \n<p>“International sources, including conflict in the Middle East and global shipping issues, could also be a source of upward pressure on energy and transport prices as the year rolls on,” she said.</p> \n<p>Housing costs were up 1%, while rents rose 0.9% for the quarter, a reduction from the 2.2% pace in the September quarter. Rents were still rising at a 7.3% rate at the end of 2023 compared to a year earlier, marginally less than the 7.6% pace in the September quarter.</p> \n<p>Furnishings and other household equipment fell the most of any category, dropping 1% in the quarter.</p> \n<p>Non-discretionary goods and services were up 4.8% from a year earlier for the December quarter, and up 0.6% in the quarter itself. With wage increases likely to be running at about a 4% clip at the end of 2023, many households would still be getting squeezed in real terms.</p> \n<p>By contrast, discretionary goods and services rose at a 3% pace in the December quarter compared to a year earlier.</p> \n<p>There was also quite a wide difference between tradeable goods and services and non-tradeable ones. With Covid disruptions all but over and with China battling falling prices, tradeables were 1.5% more expensive than a year earlier – the slowest increase in almost three years. Non-tradeables, though, were up 5.4%.</p> \n<p>Power prices in the December quarter were up 1.4%, or a third of the pace of increases in the September quarter, the ABS said.</p> \n<p>Electricity prices were up 6.9% from a year earlier – less than the half the increase we saw in the September quarter. The timing of the government’s energy bill rebates made a difference. Since the June quarter, power prices are up 5.7% but without the rebates the increase would have showed up as a 17.6% hike, the ABS said.</p> \n<p>There is increasing expectation that electricity prices will be lower after 1 July given the fall in wholesale prices in 2023, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/25/australia-wholesale-power-prices-drop-by-almost-half-as-carbon-emissions-drop\">reported last week</a>.</p> \n<p>Across the cities that the ABS surveys, Hobart posted the slowest annual increase at 3.3%, with Adelaide’s 4.8% increase the highest.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Today will bring the first stage in new, wide-ranging Brexit border controls on the import of plants, animals and food to the UK from the European Union.</p> <p>The changes, the most significant for importers since the UK left the single market three years ago, are poised to have huge ramifications for businesses that rely on imports from the continent.</p> <p>So what exactly are the changes, and will they push up the prices we pay for food and plants?</p> <h2><strong>What </strong><strong>are the new border controls?</strong></h2> <p>At midnight on Tuesday, the government triggered the first stage of a rolling programme of tighter controls on goods entering the UK from the EU. The new system, christened the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), classifies all plant and animal products coming from the EU and puts them into three risk groups: high, medium and low.</p> <p>Medium- and high-risk plant and meat products will now require health certificates before they can enter the UK.</p> <p>High-risk products include plants for planting, some seeds, tubers and live animals.</p> <p>The medium-risk category covers cut flowers and other parts of plants such as tomato plant cuttings, as well as meat, non-pasteurised milk, eggs and some fish.</p> <p>From today, anyone exporting meat and dairy products to the UK will need to find a vet in the country of origin to fill out a seven-page form giving assurances that the product is disease-free. For plant products the same assurances will be needed but from a plant health inspector.</p> <p>Low-risk products, which include some fruit and vegetables such as cucumber and asparagus, processed meats, and cheese made from pasteurised milk, will be exempt from extensive documentation.</p> <h2><strong>What are the next stages</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p>The most significant change will come on 30 April, when the government begins <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-border-target-operating-model-august-2023\">physical checks at the border</a> on medium-risk and high-risk goods coming into the country.</p> <p>These checks will take place at specially designated border control posts. Many of these control posts are extensions of existing facilities, which check plant and animal goods coming in from non-EU countries. However, some have been established specifically for these changes. This includes a new £147m facility at Sevington, near Dover, which will process all the products coming through the UK’s busiest port.</p> <p>The final major change will come in October, with the government requiring safety and security declarations for medium- and high-risk imports, while also introducing a single trade window, which the government says will reduce the number of forms needed for importers.</p> <p>As of yet, goods coming from the island of Ireland will not require physical checks but the government has said these will be introduced at some point after 31 October this year.</p> <h2><strong>Will the new border controls push up prices?</strong></h2> <p>The government has acknowledged that the extra checks are likely to add to costs for businesses and the consumer.</p> <p>It has calculated a cost of about £330m a year, and reckons this would push up retail food prices by 0.2% over three years.</p> <p>However, this may be an underestimate.</p> <p>This is because the government intends in October to add many more fruit and vegetable products, such as strawberries, apples, sweet potatoes and carrots, to the medium-risk category, meaning additional checks and certification. The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates this will add a further <a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/brexit/fruit-and-veg-imports-to-become-more-expensive-over-last-minute-brexit-rule/687629.article\">£200m a year to the cost of importing fruit and vegetables</a> from the EU.</p> <p>There are also concerns that the changes could result in less consumer choice. The Guild of Fine Food, which represents independent food and drink retailers, said smaller suppliers of certain products across the continent were likely to stop exporting to the UK because of the extra red tape.</p> <h2><strong>Why are these changes being made?</strong></h2> <p>First, there is a legal requirement. World Trade Organization rules state that trade borders for the EU must match those of the rest of the world, so as not to give the bloc a trading advantage.</p> <p>The controls, which have been delayed five times over fears that they could cause disruption and further fuel price inflation, also now mirror those that UK exporters have faced since January 2021.</p> <p>Meat and dairy farmers, who faced red tape when exporting to the EU while competitors from Europe had unfettered access to UK markets, have welcomed the changes.</p> <p>The other major reason for imposing controls on incoming goods is biosecurity. The new checks will be important for ensuring that plant and animal diseases, such as xylella, a fast-spreading bacterial disease for plants found in mainland Europe,<strong> </strong>or African swine fever, which affects pigs, are not imported.</p>",

The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up.”</p> <p>Announcing details of the interim World Economic Outlook (WEO), Gourinchas said the IMF expected global growth to be 3.1% in 2023 and 2024, upward revisions of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But he stressed the pace of expansion – which compares with an average of 3.8% during the 2010s – remained slow and there was a risk of turbulence ahead.</p> <p>The IMF said the likelihood of a hard landing had receded and risks to its forecasts were evenly balanced. Growth could be higher than expected if tumbling inflation allowed deeper cuts in interest rates, if governments facing elections boosted public spending or if artificial intelligence increased productivity.</p> <p>However, the IMF warned of downside risks including the volatile situation in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/26/vessel-on-fire-after-being-struck-off-coast-of-yemen-amid-houthi-threats#:~:text=The%20Houthis%20have%20repeatedly%20launched,key%20route%20for%20global%20trade.\">Middle East</a>; the possibility that inflation would prove stubborn and signs that investors were excessively optimistic about the scale of interest rate cuts from central banks this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/04/global-economy-2024-interest-rates-china-donald-trump\">The global economy is poised for another tumultuous year in 2024 | Kenneth Rogoff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gourinchas said he had been particularly surprised by the rapid improvement in the supply side of the global economy, singling out higher labour force participation rates, the easing of supply chain bottlenecks and lower commodity and energy prices. </p> <p>He warned that central banks “must avoid premature easing that would undo many hard-earned credibility gains and lead to a rebound in inflation”.</p> <p>However, Gourinchas added: “Signs of strain are growing in interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as construction, and loan activity has declined markedly.</p> <p>“It will be equally important to pivot toward monetary normalisation in time, as several emerging markets where inflation is well on the way down have started doing already. Not doing so would jeopardise growth and risk inflation falling below target.</p> <p>“My sense is that the US, where inflation appears more demand-driven, needs to focus on risks in the first category, while the euro area, where the surge in energy prices has played a disproportionate role, needs to manage more the second risk. In both cases, staying on the path toward a soft landing may not be easy.”</p> <p>The IMF produces two full versions of the WEO each year, in April and <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/10/10/world-economic-outlook-october-2023#Overview\">October</a>, then updates its forecasts in January and July. The latest interim WEO revised up US growth for 2023 from 2.1% to 2.5%, China from 5% to 5.2%, India from 6.3% to 6.7% and Russia from 2.2% to 3%.</p> <p>The eurozone, in contrast, performed less strongly in 2023 than previously forecast and its growth has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points to 0.5%.</p>",

So it’s about having smart and sensible regulation that works for consumers, and also works for the sector.”</p> <p>Labour’s charm offensive comes as the City faces growing threats from rival financial hubs including New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, particularly post-Brexit. London’s stock market has seen an exodus of companies, with Flutter Entertainment, the owner of FanDuel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/fanduel-owner-flutter-new-york-stock-exchange#:~:text=Listed%20on%20the%20London%20stock,more%20money%2C%20in%20the%20US.\">saying this week</a> it was considering moving its primary listing to New York “as soon as practicable”. The UK’s £275bn financial and professional services sector accounts for about 12% of the economy and is a huge tax generator.</p> <p>While the report, titled Financing Growth, is silent on Labour’s tax plans for the sector, Reeves said confirmed that banking executives could rest easy. “We have no plans for a windfall tax,” Reeves said. </p> <p>Some bankers have been concerned that Labour could end up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/09/italy-sets-cap-on-windfall-tax-for-banks-after-market-rout\">following in Italy’s footsteps</a> and launching a tax raid on profits, which have been bolstered by rising interest rates. Banks were criticised last year for raising rates on mortgages and loans more quickly than those offered to savers.</p> <p>Reeves also said she was not backing down on her plan to scrap a discounted tax rates for “carried interest” in the private equity industry, referring to the share of profits that fund managers make on successful deals. Dealmakers pay 28% capital gains tax on those profits, much lower than the 45% income tax levied on higher earners.</p> <p>“That is one of the three tax-raising policies that we have announced along with closing the non-dom tax loophole and applying VAT and business rates on private schools,” the shadow chancellor said.</p> <p>The report takes a swipe at the Tories’ record on supporting the financial sector post-Brexit and says a Labour government would work with the EU to remove “unnecessary barriers” for firms.</p> <p>In an attempt to revive the UK’s flagging stock market, Labour said it would launch a campaign to encourage consumers to buy up the shares of British companies and encourage pension schemes to push more cash into small private companies, venture capital and infrastructure investments.</p> <p>For consumers, the party said it would focus on forging on national financial inclusion strategy, to support vulnerable households. That would involve quickly rolling out regulation of controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/buy-now--pay-later\">buy now, pay later products</a>, and giving regulators power to guarantee face-to-face banking for branchless communities across the UK.</p> <p>Labour also said it would partner with City firms to make the UK a “global hub for green finance”, and ramp up the decarbonisation of the country’s housing stock, by expanding green mortgages and partnering with City firms to create loan products that can better fund retrofitting.</p> <p>It would also force City firms and the UK’s largest listed companies on the FTSE 100 to publicly declare their carbon footprint and adopt “credible” climate transition plans.</p> <p>The shadow Treasury team said it aimed to spread the wealth, with plans to expand the financial services into regional hubs, beyond London and Edinburgh, and it would establish a “Skills England” body to seek out and foster talent in those areas.</p> <p>“None of the ambitions of the next Labour government can be achieved without a strong financial sector playing its part in reviving investment,” Labour said. “It’s time we took pride in what Britain does best.”</p>",

However, two years ago Comcast recorded an $8.6bn write-down on the Sky business over growing concern over the economic outlook as the cost of living crisis began to impact consumer spending.</p> <p>In the final quarter last year, Sky reported a 13% decline in revenues to $4.42bn (£3.48bn), although this decline was significantly impacted by currency fluctuations.</p> <p>“The launch of Sky Glass and Sky Stream represents a shift in our business to deliver TV over IP [an internet connection] rather than satellite,” said a Sky spokesman. “Increasingly, customers are choosing Sky Glass and Sky Stream which don’t require specialist installation, and that has led us to change the number of roles we need to deliver our services.”</p> <p>Sky is not the only media and telecoms business seeking to reduce staff in its traditional business.</p> <p>Last year, BT said it intends to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/18/bt-cut-jobs-telecoms-group-workforce\">reduce its workforce</a> by as much as 55,000 by 2030, more than 40% of its global employee base, in large part due to the completion of the roll out of full-fibre broadband and 5G networks.</p> <p>And Vodafone is in the process of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/16/vodafone-cut-jobs-telecoms-margherita-della-valle#:~:text=Vodafone%20is%20to%20cut%2011%2C000,global%20staff%20employed%20by%20Vodafone.\">cutting 11,000 jobs</a> from its global workforce by the end of 2025, more than 10% of its 104,000 global staff, the largest round of cuts in the troubled telecoms group’s history.

            "body" : "<p>Britain’s next government should make the transition to a green economy its No 1 priority to reboot economic growth and avoid falling behind rival nations, the head one of the country’s most powerful business groups has said.</p> <p>Urging the Conservatives and Labour not to backtrack on environmental promises to score points in the general election campaign, Martha Lane Fox, the entrepreneur and British Chambers of Commerce president, said there was a danger of politicians creating a “significant brake on progress” by politicising climate goals.</p> <p>“This is beyond your electability,” she said. “This is the fundamental plank to build a robust economy. [And] the climate is too important to denigrate in the list of political priorities.”</p> <p>Speaking in an interview to mark a major report setting out business leaders’ priorities for the green transition, to be launched in Glasgow on Wednesday, Lane Fox said company bosses wanted clearer and more consistent policymaking from the government.</p> <p>It comes after Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/20/rishi-sunak-confirms-rollback-of-key-green-targets\">scaled back the government’s net zero policies</a> last autumn, drawing fierce criticism from business leaders, while Keir Starmer is under pressure to ditch a promise to invest £28bn in green industry.</p> <p>“There’s always going to be that level of political noise, especially in an election year. I personally wish it wasn’t thus, but I hope the serious politicians and serious policies are still clear for business,” Lane Fox said.</p> <p>“None of us will have a business life, none of us will have an economy, if we don’t put the planet at the heart of how we think about the next decades. It’s a bit existential. And at a more capitalist level, if you like, I really do believe that the world’s first trillionaire will come from green-related business.”</p> <p>In the first report produced by the BCC’s business council – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/14/potential-cbi-challenger-business-council-holds-first-meeting\">launched last year</a> after turmoil at the Confederation of British Industry – it called on the next government to implement a green industrial strategy to cement the UK’s status as a global leader in low-carbon enterprise.</p> <p>It also suggested the creation of a permanent cross-government body that takes a strategic approach to delivering green skills and jobs growth in the UK, inspired by the success of the Covid vaccine taskforce.</p> <p>The report from the BCC is the first in a series on five key challenges for the UK economy identified by its business council – which counts companies including BP, Drax, Heathrow and IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts as members – alongside “digital revolution”, “people and work”, “global Britain” and the “high street”.</p> <p>Lane Fox said a new body to coordinate the green transition could give business more confidence to invest in Britain, “making sure that stuff happens and that you can’t be subject to the vagaries of the political cycle” after Sunak used a speech last autumn to push back decarbonisation deadlines.</p> <p>The prime minister drew widespread criticism from business after rolling back a 2030 deadline for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by five years, while easing a ban on the sale of gas boilers from 2035.</p> <p>Lane Fox said more certainty would help after a period of “chop and change” in government, with three prime ministers in as many years. “We have had relatively more stability in the past year which I think has been helpful, but there’s a long way to go. It’s going to be a very noisy political year,” she said.</p> <p>Asked whether Labour should keep a promise to increase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/05/keir-starmer-28bn-green-investment-target-ambition\">investment in green industries by £28bn </a>a year by the end of the next parliament, Lane Fox said business leaders were looking for a “significant commitment” from government to support decarbonisation.</p> <p>“Helping unlock and having as much significant investment into this agenda would be fundamental for the future resilience of our economy and our businesses. So I don’t know if £28bn is exactly the right number. I just hope that whatever the number, that the party continues to put the green transition at the heart of how it thinks about its policies,” she added.</p>",

modernising the NHS, spending on social care, and on education.</p> \n  <p>There is also the need for critical public investment to address climate issues, and also to boost growth.</p> \n  <p>This means it is “very important” to have medium term fiscal plans in place that accommodate this pressures, and ensure that debt dynamics remain remain “stable and contained”, <strong>Gourinchas</strong>

coping with the impact of tough central bank interest-rate action to reduce inflation, the International Monetary Fund has said.</strong></p> \n  <p>Revising up its growth estimates for 2024, the IMF said a number of major economies – including the US, China, Russia and India – had posted stronger than expected performances in 2023 and it was surprised by the resilience shown.</p> \n  <p>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s economic counsellor said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“The clouds are beginning to part. The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Announcing details of the interim World Economic Outlook (WEO), Gourinchas said the IMF expected global growth to be 3.1% in both 2023 and 2024, upward revisions of 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points respectively. But he stressed the pace of expansion – which compares with an average of 3.8% during the 2010s – remained slow and there was a risk of turbulence ahead.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/30/imf-says-global-economy-heading-for-soft-landing-after-coping-with-inflation\">More here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/30/imf-says-global-economy-heading-for-soft-landing-after-coping-with-inflation\">IMF says global economy heading for ‘soft landing’ after coping with inflation</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-65b8f4d98f08e78e3c5f38fc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-30T13:11:47.263Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">IMF warns Hunt against tax cuts</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The IMF has warned UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt against cutting taxes, an intervention that is unlikely to be welcomed by the government ahead of the budget in early March.</strong></p> \n  <p>Instead of tax giveaways, the IMF argues the UK needs to curb public borrowing, rebuild its fiscal buffers, and prioritise spending in areas such as health, education and tackling climate change. </p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/539038c3-2cc2-4023-b8d8-932b81be8f3a\">Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF chief economist, told the Financial Times</a> the UK’s focus should be on “the path towards a fiscal consolidation” despite expectations that Hunt will cut taxes at his spring Budget. </p> \n  <p>Gourinchas says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“We would rather wish they would not do this type of tax cuts, and that they would instead focus on both addressing the spending needs and on the path towards a fiscal consolidation.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/539038c3-2cc2-4023-b8d8-932b81be8f3a\">More here</a>.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVJoel/status/1752316129161126348\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New: the International Monetary Fund warns that now is not the time to be cutting taxes in the UK.<br><br>Indeed, the IMF believes there’s a strong case for putting taxes up.<br><br>The Budget is on March 6th.<a href=\"https://t.co/feT2NiNriI\">https://t.co/feT2NiNriI</a></p>— Joel Hills (@ITVJoel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVJoel/status/1752316129161126348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 30, 2024</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-65b8f3d68f08e78e3c5f38ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-30T13:07:43.170Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The IMF has cut its forecast for eurozone growth, in its updated World Economic Outlook.</strong></p> \n  <p>It now expects euro area GDP to grow by 0.9% this year, down from the 1.2% forecast in October.</p> \n  <p>Expected growth in 2025 has been trimmed to 1.7% from 1.8%.</p> \n  <p>It has also revised down Germany growth forecast to 0.5% in 2024, down from 0.9% expected in October.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FirstSquawk/status/1752316752736755824\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IMF REVISES DOWN EURO AREA GDP GROWTH FORECAST TO 0.9% IN 2024 VS 1.2% IN OCTOBER;

class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“Euro area GDP was flat in the last quarter of 2023, coming in better than expectations of a 0.1% fall. This means that for the entire year, growth in the euro area economy was essentially steady. There are two ways to look at this. On the negative side, 2023 was effectively a dead year with zero growth, but on the positive side, despite record high interest rates and high inflation levels not seen since the 1970’s, the euro area economy successfully managed to avoid a recession.</p> \n   <p> “A rebound in the peripheral economies of Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, registered the highest level of growth at 0.8% in the fourth quarter. While not blistering, this growth helped mitigate depressed growth in Europe’s two powerhouse economies of Germany and France.</p> \n   <p>“Lack of growth in the euro area contrasts uncomfortably with the over 3% growth in the US over the same period. The negative implication of this is that it makes regional investment decisions for international firms all that much easier to make, with Europe looking much less attractive at this point in time. This situation is reflected in economic sentiment readings released today, which declined month on month.</p> \n   <p>“However, it’s not all doom and gloom in Europe. Inflation is within touching distance of central banks’ targeted levels, meaning interest rates should decline over the course of this and next year. This brings much welcome relief to businesses and indeed consumers’ pockets.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-65b8d3328f08b6b53cc3ca4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2024-01-30T10:47:58.074Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Today’s data shows that the eurozone fell further behind the United States at the end of last year.</strong></p> \n  <p>Data last week showed that US GDP rose by an annualised rate of 3.3% in Q4, which means a quarter-on-quarter increase of around 0.8%.

In the past, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has claimed that the kingdom could increase its capacity to 20m barrels a day.</p> <p>The decision to scrap plans to expand its capacity could “suggest that Opec+ is beginning to recognise it has a problem”, according to analysts at Citi. They added that it represented “a huge rethink of strategy and will have wide ramifications to Aramco capital spending, the Gulf supply chain and of course Opec+ oil policy”.</p> <p>The crown prince called for the multibillion-dollar expansion plan in 2020 in a show of strength as the global oil market began to falter in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>",

Chief executive Guy Gittins started his career at the listed estate agency chain in 2002, and his efforts to rebuild the firm’s database, hire more staff, bring back face-to-face training, offer more incentives and double down on the lettings business seem to be paying off.</p> <p>He says Foxtons has the largest database in London, with 5.5 million contacts (landlords, tenants, vendors and buyers) and a timeline for every property the firm has ever dealt with. It will use AI tools to predict customer behaviour.</p> <p>Founded in 1981, Foxtons quickly became a leading player in London, known for its F-emblazoned cars and aggressive sales tactics. It went through rocky times, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/28/london-property-slump-pushes-foxtons-to-first-annual-loss-since-2013\">branch closures, job cuts and plunging revenues</a> under Gittins’s predecessor Nic Budden. But last October, a year after Gittins took the helm, the company declared it had got its “mojo” back and reestablished its position as London’s No 1 estate agency brand, based on market share and growth of new instructions.</p> <p>But for some in the capital, it is a brand synonymous with the worst excesses of London’s property crunch: ever more unaffordable housing and pushy estate agents hungry for commission at all costs.</p> <p>Lettings now make up 70% of group revenues and offer stable income, unlike property sales, which are tied to the economic cycle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/jan/25/ifs-next-uk-government-worst-fiscal-inheritance-70-years-markets-eye-ecb-rates-decision-chinese-stocks-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;amp;page=with:block-65b215988f088600a74d2b55#block-65b215988f088600a74d2b55\">Lettings grew by 16% last year</a>, delivering more than £100m revenue for the first time, while sales revenues slid by 14%. Rents, which have soared in recent years, were expected to stabilise and remain at historically elevated levels, Foxtons said last week.</p> <p>“It’s not healthy for anybody,” says Gittins. “And we absolutely do not welcome 20% rent increases in a year. It’s not good for London, it’s terrible for tenants. The reality is it is a supply and demand imbalance that’s causing that issue.” A year ago, Foxtons wrote to the government asking it to act to encourage landlords back into the sector, after a removal of tax relief on mortgage interest and other measures.</p> <p>“We’re not seeing a mass exodus of landlords – that’s definitely not happening,” Gittins says. “But we’re not seeing the same volume of new landlords entering the market.”</p> <p>He sees “some green shoots” for tenants, saying there are 30% more rental properties on the market across all agencies than at this point last year. Unlike some rivals which are predicting further hefty rises in rents (Savills has forecast 6% increases), Gittins estimates it will be between 0 and 2%.</p> <p>When he was growing up, Gittins says, he was “obsessed with engines and taking things apart, trying to find a way to improve them or make them go faster – when I was in my early teens, I just wanted to be a race engineer”. So he studied engineering at Oxford Brookes University and spent a year with the Mitsubishi World Rally team, where he met businesspeople and wondered: “How did they become so&nbsp;successful?”</p> <p>That led him to his first job, at Foxtons’s largest branch in South Kensington. He was still living with his parents at the time and had borrowed a suit, tie and shoes for the interview; when he was told he could start the following Monday, he went shopping with his mum to buy his own outfits.</p> <p>He recalls: “Foxtons, particularly in the early 00s, was known as the cult because we worked and played together.” He soon became the top salesperson, because he got a flat near the office with a parking permit, which meant he could “get an extra hour’s sleep” and “do an extra viewing each day across the entire week” while others were commuting from outside London.</p> <p>After meeting the property, oil and shipping magnate Peter de Savary through Foxtons, Gittins worked for him abroad on a number of island projects, including a marina and resort village in Grenada in the Caribbean. Four years later, he returned to the UK to launch the luxury apartment block One Hyde Park for the Candy brothers, who racked up more than £2bn in sales from 86 flats.</p>    <p>A 10-year stint at Chestertons – one of the UK’s oldest estate agents, founded in 1805 – followed, where he rose through the ranks from sales director to chief executive and turned the loss-making chain&nbsp;around.</p> <p>Gittins was brought in by Foxtons’s new chairman, Nigel Rich, after the company came under mounting pressure for a change in leadership from large shareholders including Hosking Partners and Converium Capital. Activist investor Catalist claimed Foxtons had “lost its way”.</p> <p>Those investors say that Gittins is doing a good job but complain that the company’s share price, while improved, is not reflecting the progress made. Some investors are urging Foxtons to put itself up for sale, pointing to other private equity-backed deals in the sector. (Foxtons has been in private equity ownership before, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/21/privateequity#:~:text=The%20founder%20of%20London's%20largest,worth%20up%20to%20%C2%A3400m.\">founder Jon Hunt sold it to BC Partners in 2007</a>.)</p> <p>The shares, which floated at 267p in 2013 and reached a peak of 399p in 2014, are changing hands for about 54.9p. But they have risen more than 40% in the last three months.</p> <p>Django Davidson, portfolio ­manager at 10% shareholder Hosking Partners, says: “A sale is one way to close this valuation gap – a fact that we’re sure is not lost on the current board.”</p> <p>Cory Bailey, co-founder of 3G Capital, which also owns 10% of Foxtons, agrees: “It’s going to be hard for Foxtons to become a significant part of the consolidation in the sector unless they’re part of a private equity firm.” He says Foxtons’s lettings book of 30,000 properties in London is a “prime asset”.</p> <p>Chestertons was recently sold to European real estate services group Emeria, owned by the Swiss private equity firm Partners Group, for a reported £100m.</p> <p>Gittins dodges the buyout question. “We’re 100% focused on delivering the strategy that we set out, which is to deliver £25m to £30m of adjusted operating profit within the next three years,” compared with £14m last year, he says.</p> <p>Then again, everyone has a price.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 43</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married with three children (met his wife at Foxtons when they were in competing offices).</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> First-class degree in engineering and business management at Oxford Brookes University, including a year in industry with a world championship winning motorsport team.</p> <p><strong>Pay </strong>£450,000</p> <p><strong>Last holiday</strong> Christmas ski trip to Westendorf in Austria.</p> <p><strong>Best advice he’s been given</strong> “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.”</p> <p><strong>Biggest career mistake</strong> “When I first started, I thought it was important to fit in … when it was more important to stand out.”</p> <p><strong>Phrase he overuses </strong>“Show me the data!”</p> <p><strong>How he relaxes </strong>Skiing, spending time with family, rally driving in Wales, “negotiating the occasional lie-in to recharge the batteries”.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Flutter, the FTSE 100 gambling firm that owns Paddy Power, Betfair and Sky Bet, has been teasing us for the past year about moving its primary share listing to the US “in due course”. Now, on the first day of New York trading in its shares in add-on secondary form, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/fanduel-owner-flutter-new-york-stock-exchange\">says it likes the place so much it wants to go all in</a>.</p> <p>Shareholders will vote in May on a proposal to relegate the London listing to secondary status, which would amount to making it virtually irrelevant, and adopt New York for the primary. The lure of membership of the S&amp;P 500 index beats the (dwindling) prestige of the Footsie.</p> <p>Flutter – a top-20 stock with a market value of £28bn – is a bad one for London to lose. Other high-profile departures had stronger stories to tell. BHP Billiton was always Australian, so Sydney was the right venue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/17/ftse-100-to-lose-mining-firm-bhp-calls-time-on-dual-listing-in-london\">to unify a clunky, dual-headed corporate structure</a>. Plumbers’ merchant Ferguson had sold almost all of its UK assets by the time it left.</p> <p>Flutter’s arguments are sketchier. While everybody understands that the US gambling market is booming and will soon represent the company’s biggest geographical source of profits, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the “natural home”, as chief executive Peter Jackson puts it, for the shares must also be the US. Many large Footsie companies, from AstraZeneca and Shell downwards, make substantially more money in the US than they do in the UK. Indeed, about 75% of Footsie firms’ aggregate earnings are estimated to come from overseas.</p> <p>Flutter is perhaps unusual in that its head office is in Dublin and past acquisitions, including the purchases of FanDuel, the US operation, and Canada-based PokerStars have added to the international flavour on the shareholder register. These days, US-based investors own 53% of the shares, according to Bloomberg data. Even so, if alarm bells weren’t already sounding at the London Stock Exchange Group (and chief executive David Schwimmer often gives the impression he hasn’t heard them), they should be now. You can’t live for ever off past Anglo-Dutch unification victories for London such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/unilever-picks-london-as-its-home-over-rotterdam\">Unilever</a> and Relx, especially when you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/03/uk-chip-designer-arm-chooses-us-only-listing-in-blow-to-rishi-sunak\">failed to bring Arm Holdings back to the UK market</a>.</p> <p>The exchange could do with some help from the dwindling band of UK loyalists. While US shareholders dominate at Flutter, the UK-based percentage is still 21.4%, which is not nothing in the context of a special resolution that requires a 75% majority. How should the UK crew respond to Flutter’s intended flight? One hopes they vote against. It would at least send a message to other wannabe escapees in UK boardrooms that exiting to the US is not as easy as flicking a switch.</p> <p>For those funds that are allowed to own stocks only within UK or European indices, this ought to be a no-brainer. They will become forced sellers of a company with good long-term growth prospects and won’t receive a takeover premium by way of compensation. From where they sit, that proposal should have zero appeal. It is a moment to be irritating in a (probably) doomed cause.</p>",

While Uber, DoorDash and Menulog are supportive of reform to set standards in the gig economy, Hungry Panda is clearly the outlier,” Kaine said.</p>",

Institutions like the Bank of England need to play a part in that education,” he adds.</p> <p>In the time since officials at the Bank began considering a revamp of the only money museum in England and Wales, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jun/04/top-10-museum-renovations-reopenings-england-2021\">a string of museums have opened or been overhauled</a> at a cost of more than £100m.</p> <p>The Museum of Making in Derby, based in the world’s first fully mechanised factory has opened after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/24/museum-of-making-derby\">an £18m project</a>. The Imperial War Museum in London has undergone a £30.5m refit and the Museum of the Home in east London, has expanded at a cost of £18m.</p> <p>The Bank’s museum is housed on the ground floor of its grade-I listed building on Threadneedle Street and displays rare coins, cash registers and a collection that includes historically prominent women on banknotes. An exhibition on the City’s links to slavery closes next month.</p> <p>The museum, which usually attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year, will soon host an exhibition on digital payments, asking: “Can the tooth fairy go cashless? Are cryptoassets money?”</p> <p>The Bank refused to explain the decision to delay a refurbishment that was expected to introduce interactive exhibits to supplement the displays of coins and memorabilia that take up most of the space.</p> <p>It is understood museum staff have faced constraints that apply to any building with a Grade I-listing – in this case the architect Sir John Soane’s neo-classical fortress that stands opposite the Royal Exchange in the heart of London’s financial district.</p>    <p>Heritage regulations raise the costs of a revamp and limit what staff can do to refresh exhibits dating back to the Bank’s foundation in 1694. </p> <p>It museum’s only rival in the UK is Edinburgh’s Museum on the Mound, which also examines “the story of money” and has about 50,000 visitors a year. Like its London-based counterpart, it is not an independent institution, after being set up and run by Bank of Scotland, which is now part of Lloyds Banking Group.</p> <p>To give a comparison, the Science Museum group, which operates London’s Science Museum, the Science and Industry Museum, National Railway Museum, Locomotion, and National Science and Media Museum, <a href=\"https://advisor.museumsandheritage.com/news/science-museum-group-forecasts-5-million-combined-visitors-by-2026/\">expects 5 million visitors in 2026</a>.</p> <p>Walker’s review is focused on the financial education of school-age children and how teachers can incorporate basic concepts into the maths curriculum.</p> <p>The Labour party has already pledged to teach more of the maths curriculum through the prism of household budgeting, currency exchange rates for going on holiday, sports league tables and cookery recipes.</p> <p>The thinktank Centre for Social Justice <a href=\"https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/library/on-the-money\">carried out research</a> in 2022 that found two-thirds of young adults who experienced financial difficulties believed better financial education could have helped them.</p> <p>The government-funded Money and Pensions Service (MaPS) estimated in 2020 that 4.8 million children had received “a meaningful financial education”. It wants to increase the number to 6.8 million by 2030.</p> <p>MaPS research found that half of 18- to 24-year-olds report feeling anxious when thinking about their money, while about two-thirds (65%) of the same age group could not add interest earned to a savings balance or understand compound interest. Just over half (55%) of young people aged 16 and 17 are not able to read a payslip correctly.</p> <p>Sara Weller, the chair of the MaPS, said: “Experts are clear, that children form a view of money before they are seven years old and currently we don’t have a framework for teaching it until secondary school level, when children are already 11 years old.”</p>    <p>However, the plan to expand financial literacy in schools faces an uphill task. A study by the Bank in 2022 found almost two-thirds of teachers felt there was not time or resources to fit the subject into the school year.</p> <p>The most prominent exhibition in recent years to debate the importance of money was staged last year at the Fitzwilliam Museum, which is funded by the University of Cambridge.</p> <p>Under the title, Defaced! Money, Conflict, Protest, the <a href=\"https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/plan-your-visit/exhibitions/defaced-money-conflict-protest\">show</a> focused on money as a medium for protest and dissent and “highlighted the small defacements on coins and notes, which revealed the opinions of people who otherwise went unheard”.</p> <p>Much of the exhibition is on tour, but not in the UK – it can <a href=\"https://ago.ca/exhibitions/defaced-money-conflict-protest#:~:text=EXHIBITION%20OVERVIEW&amp;text=From%20laboriously%20scratched%20pennies%20to,the%20Black%20Lives%20Matter%20movement.\">now</a> be seen at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada.</p> <p>Dr Richard Kelleher, the exhibition’s curator, says: “There was a noticeable demographic shift in the age of visitors to Defaced! compared with other shows, with the biggest proportion in the 45-54 range and a definite increase in the number of younger people coming to the museum.”</p> <p>He added: “Part of the appeal of exhibitions about money is their ability to connect with the visitor. For better of worse money is a constant part of our lives and we all have a relationship with cash.</p> <p>“We covet it, don’t have enough of it, try to hide it, worry about it, try to grow it. For these reasons and others we have a means to connect. Money exhibitions can play a powerful role in developing visitors’ financial literacy; particularly driving a better understanding of the banking system, debt, assets and liabilities, inflation and concepts of value, through creative presentations of the history of money.</p> <p>Sharon Heal, the director of the Museums Association, says an independent money museum to house permanent exhibitions could fall foul of a funding crisis that is forcing many museums to consider restricting opening hours or higher charges for special exhibitions. “There is money for capital spending but the cuts to revenue budgets are severe,” she says.</p>    <p>The largest and most advanced money museum in the world is the <a href=\"https://www.mide.org.mx//\">Interactive Museum of Economics in Mexico City</a>. Funded by the central bank, government departments, big commercial banks and financial institutions, but with an independent charter, it is housed in a refurbished convent in the heart of the city.</p> <p>Among exhibits of old coins, the museum boasts a trading room with virtual reality headsets that can turn a classroom of children into day traders. There is also a “Future of Money” room that allows visitors see how digital money is created and to experiment with different ways to pay electronically.</p> <p>There are no proposals to set up an independent economics or money museum in the UK and a revamp of either of the existing museums in London or Edinburgh seems a long way off.</p>",

In Australia, we tax income at different levels (or “brackets”) depending on how much you earn. The more you earn, the higher your marginal tax rate in that bracket. That’s “progressive taxation” and it is done in pretty much every country, because the more you earn, the more capacity you have to pay.</p> <p><strong>Alright, I’m with you.</strong></p> <p>Australia currently has five different tax brackets:</p> <ul> <li><p>0-$18,200 – 0% tax</p></li> <li><p>$18,201-$45,000 – 19% tax</p></li> <li><p>$45,001-$120,000 – 32.5% tax</p></li> <li><p>$120,001-$180,000 – 37% tax</p></li> <li><p>$180,000+ – 45% tax</p></li> </ul> <p>It looks like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Marginal and average tax rates for 2023-24\">  <iframe title=\"Marginal and average tax rates for 2023-24\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-9JCjd\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9JCjd/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/9JCjd/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p><strong>What is that “average </strong><strong>rate” line?</strong></p> <p>That’s there because the marginal tax rates only apply to money you earn in those brackets. Imagine you earn $80,000. You pay no tax on the first $18,200 you earn, 19% tax on the $26,800 you earn between $18,200 and $45,000, and then you pay 32.3% on the $35,000 you earn above $45,000</p> <p>So your $80,000 is taxed like this:</p> <ul> <li><p>On the first $18,200, you pay 0% tax.</p></li> <li><p>On the next $26,800, you pay 19% tax.</p></li> <li><p>On the remaining $35,000, you pay 32.5% tax.</p></li> <li><p>In total, on your income of $80,000, you end up with a 20.6% average tax rate.</p></li> </ul> <p>That leaves you with $63,533 after tax.</p> <p><strong>I assume we are going to get to bracket creep at some point?</strong></p> <p>Yep, we’re nearly there. Now assume you get a 5% pay rise, because inflation has also gone up 5%.<strong> </strong>Now your income is $84,000, and this is how it is taxed:</p> <ul> <li><p>On the first $18,200, you pay 0% tax (no change).</p></li> <li><p>On the next $26,800, you pay 19% tax (no change).</p></li> <li><p>On the remaining $39,000, you pay 32.5% tax.</p></li> <li><p>In total, on your income of $84,000, you end up with a 21.2% average tax rate.</p></li> </ul> <p>That leaves you with $66,233 after tax.</p> <p>And <em>that</em> is bracket creep. All that happened is you got a pay rise to keep pace with inflation, but the tax system doesn’t account for inflation so you were taxed at a higher average rate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2024/jan/29/toto-the-tax-cut-cavoodle-explains-the-updated-stage-three-tax-cuts\">Toto the tax cut cavoodle explains the updated stage-three tax cuts! | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So what’s the big deal?</strong></p> <p>Well, it means your “before tax” income went up 5% but your “after tax” income only went up 4.2%. So, your real wage after tax went down. And that is bracket creep.</p> <p><strong>And why is this complicated?</strong></p> <p>Politicians will often try to tell you bracket creep is something else.</p> <p>For example, when he was trying to sell the stage-three tax cuts, the then treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told parliament that stage three “will tackle bracket creep. If you get another job or a promotion, or you do some overtime, you won’t necessarily pay a higher marginal rate of tax.”</p> <p>But if you get a promotion or another job that pays more, that’s not bracket creep – that is just you getting a better paying job, and under progressive taxation you are now able to pay a bit more in tax. You will still be better off.</p> <p><strong>Why would he or anyone else try to say that’s bracket creep?</strong></p> <p>Did you miss the part about how he was trying to sell the stage-three tax cuts?</p> <p>Bracket creep actually affects lower-income people more because wage rises mean a bigger change in the amount of their income that is taxed at a higher rate.</p> <p>By June, inflation will have risen around 17% since the tax rates were last changed, so the impact of bracket creep looks like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage change in tax paid due to bracket creep since 2020-21\">  <iframe title=\"Percentage change in tax paid due to bracket creep since 2020-21\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-HIEK3\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HIEK3/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/HIEK3/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>But now let’s include the old stage-three tax cuts:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Bracket creep since 2020-21 and the old stage-three tax cut\">  <iframe title=\"Bracket creep since 2020-21 and the old stage-three tax cut\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-z8nGG\" src=https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z8nGG/2/ scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/z8nGG/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>The old stage three was all about giving the biggest tax cuts to those on the highest income, but they are not as affected by bracket creep, so all the talk about it curing bracket creep was a bit of a fib. It was about a high-income tax cut.</p> <p><strong>So if bracket creep is about inflation, why not just increase the thresholds by inflation?</strong></p> <p>That would do it, but the question is what year you choose to start increasing the thresholds from.</p> <p><strong>Why not from now?</strong></p> <p>So you think the tax system designed by Scott Morrison is the one we should stick to?</p> <p><strong>Errr … can I say no?</strong></p> <p>What about the 2006-07 scales? If we had increased the top tax threshold in line with inflation from then, $150,000 would now be $237,596.</p> <p>Or should we go from the 2004-05 financial year when the top threshold was $70,000?

It owes more than $300bn to various creditors, according to its most recent financial report.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/29/evergrande-collapse-liquidation-china-debt-developer-property-giant\">scathing judgment delivered in Hong Kong’s high court</a> on Monday, Justice Linda Chan said “enough is enough”.</p> <p>“It is indisputable that the company is grossly insolvent and is unable to pay its debts,” Chan <a href=\"https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=157796&amp;currpage=T\">wrote</a>, as she ordered the company to liquidate its assets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/31/xi-jinping-says-chinese-business-having-tough-time-in-new-year-message\">Xi Jinping says Chinese business having ‘tough time’ in new year message</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But enforcing that order will be the next challenge and the queue of creditors who are lining up is likely to remain for many months.</p> <p>Evergrande can still appeal against Monday’s ruling. More importantly, over 90% of its assets – which <a href=\"https://mobilesite.evergrande.com/en/about.aspx?tags=2\">include</a> more than 1,300 housing projects in 280 cities – are in mainland China, a separate jurisdiction from Hong Kong, where it is far from clear if Justice Chan’s order will be enforced.</p> <p>“Good luck enforcing,” says Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of J Capital research. She recalled that when Kaisa, another Chinese property developer, defaulted on its debts in 2015, local governments in China took control of Kaisa developments and renamed them, in some cases physically barring Kaisa staff from accessing the properties.</p> <p>This means that foreign bondholders – including Top Shine Global, which brought the winding-up petition against the Evergrande – will be “hung out to dry”, says George Magnus, an economist and associate at Soas University of London.</p> <p>And a bailout is unlikely. The Chinese government “certainly don’t want to give priority to making good the losses of foreign creditors over domestic citizens,” says Magnus. “That just wouldn’t be a good look. So to the extent that somebody is going to pay a price, it will be the foreign bondholders.”</p>    <p>With tumbling Hong Kong and Chinese stock markets, a predictable commercial insolvency process is an important pillar in determining whether or not foreign companies will want to continue investing in China. It will be the steps taken by Beijing that will shape the extent to which foreign investors can feel confident that their investments into Chinese companies will be treated fairly.</p> <p>But many analysts believe that the mood music for this has already been set.</p> <p>“To the extent that companies have been gradually and gingerly shying away from future investment decisions in China … [Evergrande’s impact] is pretty neutral,” said Magnus.</p> <p>The question now is whether or not the crisis for the company that was once the jewel of China’s property sector will have repercussions throughout the wider financial system.</p> <p>Analysts have warned against predictions of China’s “Lehman moment”, when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers bank in 2008 became a crisis for the US economy. Experts at China Beige Book, a financial research firm, said that “contagion is near impossible” because Beijing maintains a tight control over the wider financial system.</p> <p>On Sunday, Chinese state media <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/china-merge-three-major-asset-managers-into-china-investment-corp-xinhua-2024-01-29/\">reported</a> that the government plans to merge three of the country’s biggest debt managers into the sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, a move that analysts have pointed to as an example of Beijing taking over the restructuring of financial institutions rather than bailing them out or paying out to creditors.</p> <p>Evergrande can still challenge Justice Chan’s decision. The company’s executive director called the judgment “regrettable” but said that operations would continue in mainland China, according to the BBC.</p> <p>That will matter to the many homebuyers who have made down payments on properties on which Evergrande has halted construction. In 2021, when Evergrande’s troubles first emerged, some 1.6 million homebuyers were in limbo as the company had taken their deposits without delivering their homes.</p> <p>In a country where nearly three-quarters of household wealth is tied to property, the future of Evergrande’s assets will be a major concern for the hundreds of thousands of ordinary Chinese whose nest eggs may be about to disappear.</p>",

However, there are issues of governance and transparency that need to be addressed and a number of decisions taken by the bodies involved do not meet the standards expected when managing public funds,” the review said.</p> <p>The heavily delayed report said the systems of governance at Houchen’s Tees Valley combined authority and STDC did “not include the expected sufficiency of transparency and oversight across the system to evidence value for money”.</p> <p>It also warned of what appeared “to be a persisting theme or culture of excessive confidentiality/lack of transparency”.</p> <p>In a letter to Houchen, Gove acknowledged “some specific areas for improvement and lessons to be learned” but underlined that the report made “clear that the panel found no evidence of corruption or illegality”.</p>    <p>Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of parliament’s business and trade committee, said the report showed the need for the National Audit Office to investigate Teesworks.</p> <p>“Mr Gove has praised Teesworks as a flagship for freeports yet today’s report highlights ‘decisions taken by the bodies involved do not meet the standards expected when managing public funds’,” said Byrne.</p> <p>“So it [would] now be wise to have a NAO investigation into the value for money for this project that funnelled £124m profit to a firm that actually did very little to invest significantly in creating jobs.”</p> <p>Justin Madders, a shadow business minister, said the report was a “damning one” as “the issue has always been one of value for money”, and on that the report showed “taxpayers money was not being spent in the way the public would expect”.</p> <p>The report, he continued, shows a “systemic and flawed decision making process that hinders transparency and fails to show value for money.</p> <p>“This scandal has exposed gaps in accountability and serious questions remain about the lack of local democratic scrutiny throughout this process.”</p> <p>Madders added: “No amount of bluster will make this a good deal for the taxpayer and nothing they [government ministers] say will change the view still held by many that something is seriously wrong in the Tees Valley.”</p> <p>Lee Rowley, the housing minister, said the review showed “no corruption, no illegality” and had recommended improvements that he was confident would be put into action.</p> <p>The row over Teesworks has been an acrimonious one, with the Middlesbrough MP, Andy McDonald, using parliamentary privilege to accuse Houchen of <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2023-04-20/debates/6C6DF11C-9F31-4D50-B5A8-408210ADA4D9/BusinessOfTheHouse#contribution-AB1AC652-7848-4B12-893A-5E49887EA5D0\">“truly shocking industrial-scale corruption”</a>.</p> <p>Houchen responded by calling McDonald a “liar” and a “coward” for failing to repeat the allegations away from the Commons chamber.</p> <p>The mayor welcomed the report, “which sets out in black and white that there is no corruption or illegality at Teesworks”.</p> <p>He added: “I welcome the recommendations of the panel and my team and I are already working to review the recommendations to improve our processes and procedures in line with the report’s findings.”</p> <p>Afterwards, McDonald said: “This report is absolutely damning and what is clear is there are massive concerns about governance and finance, oversight, scrutiny, value for money – all of the things that I have said over these years.</p> <p>“The system is completely flawed and as a net result we have got the enrichment of a handful of businessmen making money hand over fist at no risk whatsoever.

He was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/13/bp-to-claw-back-32m-from-bernard-looney-after-dismissal-as-ceo\">formally dismissed</a> and denied more than £32m in pay and share awards over “serious misconduct”.</p> <p>However, BP is still run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/14/bp-must-not-backtrack-climate-action-after-ceo-exit-campaigners-bernard-looney\">supporters of Looney’s strategy</a>. Chairman Helge Lund appointed Looney’s former finance boss, Murray Auchincloss, as chief executive.</p> <p>Bluebell co-founders Giuseppe Bivona and Marco Taricco wrote in their letter that they would have called for Looney’s resignation had he not left. The letter was sent in October, shortly after it acquired a small stake in BP.</p> <p>Bluebell is a relatively small but influential fund which has previously mounted campaigns against French food company Danone, where it played a part in the departure of its chief executive, as well as in Glencore, where it failed in its efforts to have the UK-listed commodities company sell its thermal coal operations. However, it only manages about $150m across a dozen or so companies, meaning it does not have the financial might to force BP into a shareholder vote.</p> <p>Bivona told the Guardian that the company was made up of “passionate environmentalists”, and that the fund manager was “not telling BP to stay away from clean energy”.</p> <p>However, he said he wanted BP to “stay away from businesses in which they have no right to win” and where investment returns are low, such as solar and offshore wind.</p> <p>In the 30-page letter, which was first reported by the Financial Times, Bluebell argued that BP was worth 50% more than its share price implied, and called for it to increase production in the next few years and pledge only to cut emissions “in line with society”. BP’s shares traded at 466p on Monday, valuing the company at £79bn.</p> <p>Bluebell’s calls for a change in strategy will face opposition from BP’s leadership and also from environmentalists, many of whom argue that the company is still not doing enough to cut emissions. The International Energy Agency in 2021 said that no new oil and gas fields should be drilled if the world is to limit temperature increases.</p> <p>Mark van Baal, head of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/20/climate-activist-shareholders-to-target-us-oil-giant-chevron\">Dutch activist group Follow This</a>, has in recent years forced shareholder votes at BP, Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil calling for stronger emissions reduction targets.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/us-oil-company-exxonmobil-investors-climate-follow-this\">ExxonMobil is taking legal action</a> to try to dismiss a resolution for its next annual meeting.</p> <p>Van Baal questioned whether Bluebell would gain much shareholder support, and argued that BP’s share price under performance versus peers was related to its decision to cut its dividend in 2020.</p> <p>“We don’t think responsible shareholders will allow a conservative investor to slow down a transition that is already moving far too slowly,” he said.</p> <p>“Letters don’t change companies; shareholders’ votes do. Let them file a shareholder resolution and see how many shareholders support going back in time. We don’t think they will get much votes.”</p> <p>A BP spokesperson said the company “welcomes constructive engagement with our shareholders” and that it has received support for its strategy after recent meetings with most major shareholders.</p> <p>The spokesperson said: “We continue to make significant progress, remain focused on delivery, and are confident the strategy will grow the value of BP and deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders.”</p>",

Flutter generated sales of £3.6bn ($4.59bn) in the US last year – up from £191m ($243m) in 2018, when the US supreme court struck down a decades-old law that prohibited sports betting across much of the country.</p> <p>FanDuel, with its rival operators DraftKings and BetMGM, has led the sharp-elbowed race to dominate the nascent US online gambling market.</p> <p>Peter Jackson, chief executive of Flutter, said it soon expects the US to generate “the largest proportion” of its profits. “With our NYSE listing effective today, this is a pivotal moment for the group as we make Flutter more accessible to US-based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets.”</p> <p>Ditching its primary listing in London would set the stage for Flutter to exit Britain’s FTSE 100 stock index. It will put the plan to shareholders in May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/26/are-uk-employers-going-too-far-with-strict-rules-on-workplace-relationships\">Are UK employers going too far with strict rules on workplace relationships?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Listed on the London stock exchange and headquartered in Dublin, Flutter has already dropped a second listing in Dublin to join the New York stock exchange: a move designed to boost its profile, and grant it access to more money, in the US.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1635327/000119312524009708/d496321d20fr12ba.htm\">regulatory filing</a> ahead of the switch, Flutter described “a long runway” for future growth – but acknowledged that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/01/sports-betting-regulation-gambling-addiction\">concerns around problem gambling</a> could “significantly influence” future regulation of its industry, prompt investigations and dissuade people from placing bets.</p> <p>Sports betting’s liberalization across the US has been so transformative for Flutter that Jackson has <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/flutter-plays-the-long-game-as-american-fantasy-comes-true-lmnlb2zth\">floated</a> making 18 May – the day of the supreme court decision – a company holiday. It agreed to acquire a controlling stake in FanDuel just days after the 2018 ruling.</p> <p>Five years ago, the group (then known as Paddy Power Betfair) relied on the US for about 10% of its business; by last year, the market was responsible for almost 40% of its sales.</p> <p>While sports betting is now legal in 36 states and Washington DC, major states including Texas have yet to follow. Flutter is confident they will. California voters rejected the prospect in 2022, but the company described “multiple ongoing initiatives” to change the state’s stance in its filing. “The expectation is that legalized sports betting will be back on the ballot in the near future.”</p> <p>Wall Street is bullish, too. Online gambling is a “hyper growth industry” in the US, said Joe Stauff, an analyst at Susquehanna, a trading firm. “FanDuel has a huge competitive advantage.”</p> <p>“It’s crazy,” added Mike Hickey of Benchmark, an investment bank. “It’s just getting started … It’s going to be a massive market in the US.”</p> <p>But Flutter noted in the filing that “social responsibility concerns” could “significantly influence the regulation of online betting and iGaming and impact responsible gaming requirements, could result in investigations and litigation, and may adversely impact our reputation.”</p> <p>The industry claims to already be highly regulated. It has pushed back hard against proposals in Congress to ban gambling advertising in the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/27/gambling-addiction-bill-treatment-online-sport-betting-andrea-salinas\">divert tax receipts from sports wagers towards problem gambling treatment programs</a>.</p> <p>“As markets mature, usually regulation follows,” said Hickey. “Regulation is always a concern, for sure. And it’s going to happen.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>At the start of the pandemic, Ceola Luna, a 45-year-old Lyft driver in Los Angeles, bought a 2005 Saturn Vue crossover, after her new Dodge Caravan (a minivan) was wrecked in a crash. The Vue wasn’t nearly as nice, but it was affordable at $4,000 – including rust, engine issues and a dashboard full of warning lights.</p> <p>With no other income to support herself and three children, driving was an economic lifeline for Luna. But much of what she made ended up going to car mechanics as the small SUV kept breaking down. Then last year, Lyft informed Luna that her Vue had gotten too old for the platform, leaving her jobless. So she scrambled to find a new gig as a care worker for autistic children, and then the car failed again. To save up for another mechanic appointment, Luna has been taking the bus to her clients – sapping her earnings with hours of unpaid commute time.</p> <p>A replacement car is out of the question, because she barely has enough money for rent. But even if Luna had the funds to go shopping, it’s unlikely she would find anything remotely reasonable. The average new car today sells for nearly $49,000, and the average used car lists at more than $26,000 – representing a 31% increase for new cars and nearly 40% increase for used cars since 2020, according to <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights/#snapshot\">data</a> from the industry group Cox Automotive.</p> <p>These increases have brought the total cost of car ownership to all-time highs in a country where cars aren’t really optional. And that’s despite the easing of inflation and the supply chain issues that snarled the auto industry during the pandemic. So why are consumers still getting squeezed?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/cars-growing-wider-europe-report\">SUVs drive trend for new cars to grow 1cm wider in UK and EU every two years, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here’s a hint: the automakers are doing great. By essentially coordinating an industry-wide production cut, the pandemic gave manufacturers power to demand mind-boggling prices for fewer cars, leading to record profits. As consumers adjusted their expectations, executives saw an opportunity to establish a lucrative new normal. Low inventory is an “opportunity to drive strong margins”, GM’s CEO, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/3796818-new-cars-are-for-richer-people-how-the-auto-industry-capitalized-on-pandemic/\">Mary Barra, told shareholders</a> in 2022. Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, went even further, declaring: “I want to make it extremely clear to everyone: we are going to run our business with a lower day supply than we have had in the recent past because that’s good for our company.”</p> <p>Brian Moody, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, a car industry publication, says automakers used the pandemic to shift product lines toward higher-margin products. Instead of small cars and base models, they pivoted to luxury cars and SUVs with fully loaded trims, which turn far greater profits per sale. That means “the less expensive the car, the fewer choices you have”, says Moody. Some commentators have called the trend “<a href=\"https://www.theautopian.com/trimflation-explaining-why-automakers-raised-prices-so-much-in-the-pandemic/\">trimflation</a>”. A 2023 Cox Automotive <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/seismic-shift-the-u-s-new-vehicle-market-is-becoming-a-luxury-market/\">report</a> declared that “the US new vehicle market is becoming a luxury market”, a “seismic shift” that, for many buyers, is “about as enjoyable as a sharp stick in the eye”.</p> <p>But the hurt isn’t limited to car buyers; it’s spread to car owners as well. Like Ben Valdez, who supplements his $60,000 salary as a computer tech at a California community college by driving for Uber in an older-generation Toyota Prius with 280,000 miles. Because Uber deems drivers independent contractors, Valdez is on the hook for all maintenance costs, which have ballooned: “Three years ago, I was probably paying as little as $50 for an oil change. Now I’m looking at no less than $100, and I’ve seen it as high as $150 for just four quarts of synthetic oil.” The cost of car tires has gone up by more than half. Even the price of a car wash, something Valdez needs to do regularly to keep passengers happy, has gone from about $25 to nearly $45, he says.</p>    <p>The cost of insurance has brought even more pain. <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SETE?output_view=data\">Data</a> from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average cost of car insurance rose more than 14% between the end of 2021 and 2022, before soaring another 20% by the end of 2023, the largest one-year increase since the 1970s.</p> <p>Divya Sangameshwar, an insurance expert at Value Penguin, says those rapid increases have several causes. One is that the rising cost of vehicles and maintenance means insurers have to pay out more when things go wrong. Another is that more vehicles are getting ravaged by the climate crisis. The vehicle data company Carfax estimates that Hurricane Ian destroyed as many as 358,000 cars as the storm tore through Florida and the Carolinas in 2022. The climate crisis, in turn, is only being exacerbated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-suvs-the-trend-towards-vast-cars-needs-to-be-reversed\">trend toward massive vehicles</a>. Unless action is taken to reverse climate change, Sangameshwar says, “it is undeniable that it will continue to have an impact on auto insurance premiums for the next 100 years”.</p> <p>Until 2022, state governments, which approve rate increases, had been keeping insurance premiums relatively flat for years, leading to “pent-up pressure” among some insurance companies, which “were threatening to walk out of markets where they weren’t profitable any more”, Sangameshwar says. But now that states have relented, insurers are doing splendidly. Companies like Progressive and Travelers reported <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/insurance-companies-profits-stock-ebae7fd1?st=5rf7q520tlj76oa&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\">record-breaking profits</a> this year thanks to the big rate increases, and they say more rate increases are on the way.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, American jobs have become increasingly dispersed throughout the suburbs, says David King, an associate professor of urban planning at the Arizona State University. Research shows that car-owning Americans have access to far more job options, and “having a reliable car means that you’re more likely to be able to keep that job”, King says.</p> <p>The preferred solution of many planners – replace car trips with transit – faces difficult odds in this country. Across the United States, transit riderships remain much lower than pre-pandemic numbers, and with Covid-era federal grants due to expire this year, many transit authorities are planning service cuts, sparking fears of a “<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/15/1212879398/public-transit-ridership-down-covid-pandemic-death-spiral\">death spiral</a>”.</p> <p>That’s why King says it’s just as important in the short run to make cars more affordable for people who need them – a proposal he calls “<a href=\"https://transfersmagazine.org/magazine-article/issue-11/the-necessity-of-cars/\">universal auto access</a>”. The planner envisions government subsidies for lower-income people to buy or maintain cars, paired with new incentives and regulations to steer manufacturers back toward smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This car-positive proposal doesn’t make him popular among planning circles, King concedes. But “it’s a realist approach: this is the world that we have, and we can still work for a better world while not leaving some people out of it.”</p>",

More than 40% of our claimants are aged over 70, and more than 150 of them are dying every day.

We take our responsibilities to customers very seriously and are dedicated to keeping our customers connected, while helping those who need it most.”</p> <p>However, when Le Patourel took his case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal in 2021 seeking permission to take BT to trial, the three-member tribunal was unanimous in ruling that the claim showed more than enough merit to be pursued.</p> <p>“We conclude that there is a real prospect of success for this claim,” the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/28/bt-faces-600m-legal-case-over-landline-charges\">tribunal concluded</a> in its 42-page ruling at the time.</p>",

Only LNER, one of the three operators directly run by the Department for Transport, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/18/lner-train-drivers-strike-february-aslef\">planned to use the new powers</a> to demand that drivers break the strike. An immediate escalation by Aslef, which called five additional days of strikes at LNER, prompted a climbdown.</p> <p>Rail industry bosses as well as unions had made clear their reservations in consultations and select committee hearings ahead of the strike laws being introduced, which could also be applied in health, education and firefighters disputes. Labour has said it will immediately repeal the laws if elected.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian before the latest industrial action, Whelan said: “We made the point that it was unworkable, we believed it was terribly unsafe. We made the point, which was borne out by the government’s own impact assessment, that it would lead to more strife. Rather than trying to resolve the situation, they tried to introduce forced labour into the country, to our eternal shame.</p> <p>“First time they’ve tried it, they’ve backed off. I’m of the view they’ll try it again. Nobody can tell us how to safely do it.”</p> <p>Separately, the Public and Commercial Services Union said on Saturday it would use the Human Rights Act to challenge the minimum service law. The announcement was made by the PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, at a rally to mark the 40th anniversary of the ban on trade unions at the GCHQ headquarters.</p> <p>After the threatened extended rail strikes on the London-Newcastle-Edinburgh mainline, and potential for more elsewhere, the more localised 24-hour disruption of rolling walkouts may be a relief for passengers. However, given the lack of progress in more than 18 months of strikes, what does Whelan hope to achieve?</p> <p>“Well, there are two choices in life – to do something or do nothing. And we don’t actually have the choice to do nothing,” he said.</p> <p>“I’ve got drivers who in February [will] have gone five years without a pay deal – half a decade. People who put their lives at risk during a pandemic, to get other key workers to work and move food and medicine around the country.”</p> <p>The strikes would, Whelan said, “keep raising the profile of our dispute until somebody comes to the table to resolve it with us. I’d happily go back into talks tomorrow to find a way forward – even though we’ve been crapped on from a great height twice before when we’ve gone into long-term talks.</p> <p>“We’ve gone in in good faith, and at the end the Rail Delivery Group and the government behaved dishonourably and deceitfully. Still, we have to find a way to resolve it.”</p> <p>An overtime ban starting on Monday will apply at all of the companies throughout the strike period. It is likely to cause additional disruption for operators such as TransPennine Express that rely on rest day working.</p> <p>The RDG has advised passengers to check before they travel, while those who have to travel should expect disruption, plan ahead and check when their first and last train will depart.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the RDG said: “There are no winners from these strikes that will unfortunately cause disruption for our customers. We believe rail can have a bright future, but right now taxpayers are contributing an extra £54m a week to keep services running post-Covid.</p> <p>“Aslef’s leadership need to recognise the financial challenge facing rail. Drivers have been made an offer which would take base salaries to nearly £65,000 for a four-day week before overtime – that is well above the national average and significantly more than many of our customers that have no option to work from home are paid.”</p> <p>A DfT spokesperson said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have already facilitated talks that led to this fair and reasonable offer from industry – Aslef bosses should put it to their members so we can resolve the dispute, which has already happened with the RMT, TSSA and Unite unions.</p> <p>“With passenger revenues not having recovered since the pandemic, the taxpayer has had to prop up the railways with £12bn in the past year alone – these strikes will not change the need for urgent workplace reforms that Aslef continue to block.”</p>",

However it can still appeal.</p> <p>Justice Linda Chan delivered the ruling on Monday morning, saying “it is time for the court to say enough is enough”.</p> <p>The liquidation petition was lodged by Top Shine in June 2022, an investor in Evergrande unit Fangchebao which said the developer had failed to honour an agreement to repurchase shares it had bought in the subsidiary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/05/evergrande-the-runaway-developer-that-could-become-a-wrecking-ball-for-chinas-economy\">Evergrande, the ‘runaway’ developer that could become a wrecking ball for China’s economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evergrande had been working on a $23bn debt revamp plan but this fell apart in September when the company announced its founder, billionaire Hui Ka Yan, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/28/evergrande-founder-being-investigated-for-suspected-crimes\">under investigation for “suspected illegal crimes”</a>.</p> <p>Provisional liquidators will be announced on Monday afternoon. They will be expected to take control of Evergrande assets, negotiate with creditors on debt restructuring, and take over management of the company.</p> <p>But the process is expected to be complicated and have little impact on the company’s operations in the immediate term. Offshore liquidators, appointed by creditors and tasked with taking control of Evergrande’s subsidiaries in mainland China, could take months or years, and would probably face difficulty in the process.</p> <p>China is a different jurisdiction to Hong Kong, and in previous cases like developer Kaisa group, and solar company Suntech, the processes had been “murky”, said analyst Anne Stevenson-Yang, founder of J Capital research.</p> <p>“I think the point is there isn’t really an orderly legal process.”</p> <p>Redmond Wong, chief China strategist at Saxo Markets, said the likelihood of Evergrande shareholders in Hong Kong getting anything out of the winding up process was “very low”.</p> <p>“For overseas creditors, focus will be on if the liquidator will succeed in its applications for assistance to mainland courts in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xiamen under the cooperation mechanism re-established in 2021 and get hold of assets in the mainland.”</p> <p>Trading was halted in China Evergrande, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, and Evergrande Property Services, after the verdict. Shares were already trading down as much as 20% before the hearing on Monday.</p> <p>It was unclear on Monday how the ruling would impact the industry and China’s struggling economy. Stevenson-Yang said much of the impact of Evergrande’s woes had already been felt after it defaulted in 2021. Since China’s central government tightened regulations in 2020, companies responsible for about 40% of Chinese home sales have defaulted. China is grappling with an underperforming economy, its worst property market in nine years and a stock market wallowing near five-year lows, and its government has been making intense interventions.</p> <p>“This kind of desperation of the Chinese government to support the stock market, and now I hear they’re <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/china-merge-three-major-asset-managers-into-china-investment-corp-xinhua-2024-01-29/\">merging all these asset management companies</a> into the [sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp], just really kind of hoping they can continue to kick the ball down the road,” she said.</p>",

It would also replace about 200 of the jobs under threat at Port Talbot, Tata said – although that would still leave thousands out of work.</p> <p>The document said: “Tata Steel has also made clear that, with the right investment and policy environment, it is open to further investment, such as in a direct reduced iron (DRI) plant. We would look at the case for a potential DRI plant in the UK if the business conditions are right and, if in future, the government supported further investment.”</p> <p>The document also directly addresses the prospect of a Labour government, adding that the company “is open to further investment in the future” but that it wants to turn the Port Talbot plant to profit first. Labour has said it will invest £3bn in the steel industry, and it is seriously considering backing hydrogen steelmaking as an option.</p> <p>However, some politicians, including local MPs, may look sceptically at any suggestion that Tata should be given hundreds of millions of pounds more in subsidies shortly after it has received about £1bn in pledged support. Half of that will support Port Talbot’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/15/tata-steel-seals-500m-uk-support-package-but-big-job-losses-feared\">switch to electric arc furnaces</a> – remaking new steel from the UK’s abundant scrap – while the rest will help Tata, which also owns Jaguar Land Rover, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/19/tata-gigafactory-plan-fills-major-blank-for-future-uk-car-industry\">build a gigafactory</a> to make batteries for electric cars.</p> <p>The company’s executives are to claim that Tata has been “an incredibly patient investor” in the UK steelworks since acquiring it in 2007, but that it has made no profit or dividends.</p> <p>It is understood that the document contains the core arguments Narendran and Nair intend to make at the committee hearing. The committee will also hear evidence from Vaughan Gething, the minister for the economy for the Welsh government, as well as representatives of the Community, GMB and Unite unions.</p> <p>Tata plans to import semi-finished steel slabs from sites in India and the Netherlands before the electric arc furnace is operational in 2027. The GMB is expected to argue that the steel imported while the EAF is being built is likely to have a high carbon content, even before the emissions generated in transit to the UK are taken into account.</p> <p>The unions have previously criticised Tata for highlighting its emissions reduction efforts in the UK, while at the same time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/unions-accuse-tata-of-hypocrisy-over-port-talbot-closure-green-claims\">building a new, polluting blast furnace at Kalinganagar</a>, in its home country of India.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>UK politics is stuck in a holding pattern. Ever since Liz Truss’s seven-week stint as prime minister, opinion polls have been consistent: the Conservatives are on course for a thumping defeat. Historical precedent suggests the race should get tighter as the election approaches but there is currently no evidence of that happening. In fact, Labour’s lead seems to be <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/48418-voting-intention-con-20-lab-47-16-17-jan-2024\">getting bigger</a>.</p> <p>What is worrying for the government is that its political plight seems to be getting worse even though the economic news has been getting modestly better.</p> <p>The big development in recent months has been the sharp fall in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/20/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis\">inflation</a>, which has had two significant knock-on effects: it has reduced interest payments on the national debt and led to mortgage lenders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/jan/23/nationwide-intensifies-mortgage-price-war-with-its-lowest-rates-for-8-months\">reducing home loan rates</a> in anticipation of lower interest rates from the Bank of England.

If they have, there is scant evidence that they give the Conservatives any credit. As a result, the idea of an early election – which was being toyed with a couple of months back – has been ditched. The chancellor has not yet abandoned all hope of victory but wants the election delayed until the autumn, by which time the Bank should have started to cut interest rates and the effects of tax cuts will have be showing up in pay packets for several months. There is even talk of squeezing in another package of tax cuts in the autumn, which really would be a desperate last roll of the dice.</p> <p>In reality, the Conservatives are now looking at damage limitation rather than victory – and even that will require not just tax cuts but also significant reductions in interest rates.</p> <p>This Thursday the Bank will provide its quarterly assessment of the state of the economy and announce its latest decision on interest rates. It is a stone-cold certainty that official borrowing costs will be left at 5.25% but of more interest will be Threadneedle Street’s steer on what happens next.</p> <p>In its November 2023 <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2023/november-2023\">health check</a>, the Bank stressed that interest rates were likely to remain high for an extended period and might need to rise if there was evidence of more persistent inflationary pressures. The best judgment of its nine-strong monetary policy committee was that inflation would not return to its 2% target until the end of 2025.</p> <p>In the light of subsequent events, that now looks far too pessimistic. Analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics think tumbling energy prices will bring the annual inflation rate down from 4% now to 1.8% in April and to just 0.9% in September.</p> <p>If the Capital Economics forecasts are anywhere near correct, the Bank will soon come under strong pressure to cut interest rates, pressure that it is likely to resist for only so long. There is sure to be a softening of its stance on Thursday, with talk of further rate rises dropped and perhaps an indication of cuts, provided the fall in inflation is sustained.</p> <p>For now, the MPC is likely to take a cautious approach. It will point out that the labour market remains tight and that core inflation – which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco – is still <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1317058/uk-core-inflation-rate/#:~:text=The%20core%20inflation%20rate%20for,the%20UK%20was%20four%20percent.\">above 5%</a>. The Bank will be monitoring pay settlements closely as the 2024 pay round gets under way.</p> <p>It is also likely to warn that financial markets are getting carried away in expecting four quarter-point cuts this year and that there is a risk that the sort of rapid and aggressive easing of policy currently expected by the City might lead to inflation being above its 2% target in 2026. But rates have peaked at 5.25% and the next move will be down.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street will be interested to see what Hunt decides to do in his budget on 6 March but you don’t need a crystal ball to work out what is going to happen. Frankly, it is not a question of whether or not the chancellor cuts personal taxes because that decision – as he made clear in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/18/jeremy-hunt-hints-at-voter-friendly-tax-giveaway-in-march-budget\">comments</a> made in Davos earlier this month – has already been taken. The real issue is by how much he cuts them, and the signs are that he might have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/jeremy-hunt-tax-cuts-borrowing-deficit\">about £20bn to play with</a>.</p> <p>That’s not to say cutting income tax and again freezing fuel duty for motorists is the best use of £20bn. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/25/labour-and-tories-need-to-be-honest-about-economic-trade-offs-says-ifs\">high risk</a> that any tax cuts now will be paid for by tax rises or spending cuts after the election.</p> <p>It is certainly not hard to think of better uses for a £20bn windfall. Current Treasury plans involve a £20bn cut in public investment by 2028-29, which Hunt could reverse if he chose to do so. That would boost long-term growth potential rather than consumer spending.</p> <p>Alternatively, he could spend the money on repairing the UK’s threadbare welfare safety net. In a <a href=\"https://www.financialfairness.org.uk/docs?editionId=c9f66338-7c19-4ee8-8634-b0f800c19dc6&amp;mc_cid=8adccae307&amp;mc_eid=d24b73c812\">report</a> released last week, Donald Hirsch, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University, said the system was failing to meet the most basic needs, concluding: “Today, we do not have a safety net worth its name.”</p> <p>That’s a disgrace but only someone not really paying attention would imagine that the last budget before an election is going to be devoted to making the social safety net fit for purpose. Governments facing a wipeout will always find a way to cut taxes even if the chances of them having a material impact on the election – as in this case – are vanishingly small.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Kemi Badenoch has suggested there could be a wider shake-up at the Post Office over the Horizon scandal and other problems, after she asked its chair to leave at the weekend.</p> <p>The business secretary said she had needed to intervene as there were “difficulties with the board” at the Post Office when asked about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/27/post-office-chair-dismissed-as-business-reels-from-horizon-it-scandal\">Henry Staunton’s departure</a>.</p> <p>The Post Office has been under huge scrutiny since an ITV dramatisation of the scandal over post office operators wrongly convicted of fraud because of the faulty Horizon IT system. Since then, the government has rushed through legislation to compensate those affected more quickly.</p> <p>The government had said Staunton left by mutual consent on Saturday night. Asked whether he had been fired, Badenoch told Sky’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: “Yes, we had a conversation and we agreed that it was better that the Post Office had new leadership going forward.”</p> <p>She added: “It was very sad that we had to come to this conclusion and one of the things that I think is important – and one of the things that I think is important when we do need to have a change of personnel – is that we don’t hound the people or go after them.</p> <p>“The issues that the Post Office have go well beyond the Horizon scandal, so this wasn’t just about Horizon and the ongoing inquiry into the Post Office. It’s about the Post Office as an entity and the governance of it.</p> <p>“There is a board, there have been disagreements across the board, and my view is that sometimes you just need a different person to deal with different issues.”</p> <p>She said a failure to change the leadership of the Post Office would have been “bureaucratic indifference” and said she had not appointed him in the first place.</p> <p>When asked whether there could be further changes to the board, Badenoch said she was not going to announce HR moves on television.</p> <p>“I won’t be making any further comments around personnel changes. I think we need to do this in a civilised way,” she said.</p> <p>Asked whether she felt ashamed that it took an ITV drama to prompt action, the business secretary said: “It wasn’t TV that made this happen. It had been happening … The drama is not what has been prompting government action.”</p> <p>Staunton, 75, became chair in December 2022 after a long career in FTSE boardrooms.</p> <p>The decision to replace him came as Rishi Sunak tries to push through new laws to “swiftly exonerate and compensate” those affected by the Horizon scandal.</p> <p>Badenoch said she “certainly” expects Fujitsu, which provided the faulty Horizon IT system, to pay compensation over the scandal that led to subpostmasters wrongly convicted of fraud.</p> <p>The business secretary said she had written to the chair of the company asking for meetings but he was based in Japan so “it’s not that straightforward”.</p> <p>She said: “I certainly expect that that will happen in due course … Previously we’ve been waiting till the end of the inquiry and it is important that we get to the end of that inquiry to know what should happen.</p> <p>“But Fujitsu is a part of this, they are very much a part of this story, it’s not just Post Office management, and I hope that they will do the right thing.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Aviation jargon can hide all kinds of horrors. This month Boeing introduced a new phrase to a wider audience – <em>Quality escape</em><em> (n.)</em>: part of a 737 Max plane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/06/alaska-airlines-grounds-boeing-737-max-9-planes-after-mid-air-window-blowout\">falling off at 14,000ft</a>, producing a deafening roar as the air rushes past passengers fast enough to rip phones from hands and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/alaska-airlines-boeing-737-max-9-blowout\">clothing from bodies</a>.</p> <p>It appears that someone in the factory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/12/alaska-airlines-incident-shows-boeing-still-has-much-to-fix\">failed to properly fit bolts </a>securing the plug panel for an unused door. For followers of Boeing’s travails over recent years, the apparent failures in quality control that led to the incident were scarcely believable, less than five years after regulators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/16/boeing-737-max-production-faa\">grounded the 737 Max</a> following two deadly crashes caused by flawed design.</p> <p>Remarkably, no one was seriously injured or killed in the latest incident, which took place on an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2024/jan/06/alaska-airlines-plane-makes-emergency-landing-after-window-blows-out-mid-air-video\">Alaska Airlines flight on 5 January</a> from Portland, Oregon. But Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, will face intense scrutiny from investors on Wednesday as the company publishes its results for the past year. Once again, the US’s plane-making champion is facing deep questions about its future.</p> <p>Calhoun quickly accepted the manufacturer had at least partial responsibility for the latest incident – in marked contrast to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/18/boeing-may-have-unknowingly-misled-regulators-about-crash-linked-software\">heavily criticised dithering and diversion</a> by his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, during the previous 737 Max crisis. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator, last week said that it would allow the variant of the 737 Max 9 with the door plug to fly again – after demanding checks to the bolts on every plane.</p> <p>Yet the FAA’s green light came with a major caveat: Boeing would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/boeing-ceo-plane-safety\">not be allowed to expand production</a> of the 737 Max, its bestselling plane, until the regulator was “satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved”. Calhoun will be pushed for guidance on the cost of the resulting delays to deliveries, although he may struggle to give precise numbers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoiGuuGZPNc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoiGuuGZPNc?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy, said he believed Boeing had “under-resourced production ramp-up”, leaving too few workers trying to make too many planes. He said that was a symptom of Boeing’s focus in recent decades on financial performance at the expense of its historical design prowess.</p> <p>The financial focus was most closely associated with Jim McNerney, chief executive for the decade up to 2015. McNerney had learned his trade from Jack Welch, the boss of General Electric (GE). Welch became a household name by pumping up financial performance, only for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/08/jack-welch-general-electric-chairman-flaws-capitalism\">legacy to be questioned when GE nearly collapsed</a> during the financial crisis.</p> <p>Calhoun is himself a 26-year GE veteran. Boeing appears to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/12/alaska-airlines-incident-shows-boeing-still-has-much-to-fix\">lining up Stephanie Pope as a potential next leader</a>. But Pope, who was promoted on 1 January to chief operating officer, also comes from a financial rather than engineering background.</p> <p>Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, said Boeing needed new leaders to return its focus to being “one of the greatest engineering companies the world has ever seen” rather than an also-ran that was steadily losing market share to its European rival Airbus.</p> <p>The earlier Max crisis and the pandemic took a heavy financial toll on Boeing, and analysts expect a further $2.1bn (£1.6bn) loss before tax for 2023 – its fifth year in a row in the red – according to forecasts collated by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p> <p>Boeing is not in danger of going out of business. The company is too big to fail, a behemoth whose travails are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/17/shares-in-boeing-uk-suppliers-fall-after-737-max-production-halted\">large enough to show up in US GDP figures</a>. It could go to investors to ask for more cash. Some analysts say it could even look to sell its defence arm if the needs of the civil aviation business become acute. And the US government would almost certainly act as a backstop if its crises somehow worsened. But failure is not merely a financial measure, as passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight can attest.</p> <p>Cunningham said Boeing needed to generate cash to pay for the eventual development of a new plane to replace the ageing 737 – even if Calhoun has said the company will not do so for about a decade. That could be its opportunity to get out of a hole and help it catch up with Airbus, but the latest incident will probably delay that again.</p> <p>“The issue is the business cycle doesn’t go on for ever,” said Cunningham, meaning the industry could go through a fallow period during which orders and cashflow dry up. “Boeing is running out of time.”</p>",

Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/biden-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act\">has done it for the US</a>. Why not Keir Starmer in the UK?</p> <p>Transforming the economy will come at an outsize cost. Worse, it’s an escalating cost that is way beyond the public finances of Britain and possibly even the EU.</p> <p>There is money on offer from the private sector: the world is swimming in cash looking for a home. It’s the demand for super returns that makes a much-needed upgrade of UK infrastructure – from hospitals to the electricity grid – look&nbsp;unaffordable.</p> <p>Biden is finding this out. His Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is the US’s main vehicle for spurring a move to lower-carbon energy consumption, works alongside, and overlaps with, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips and Science Act, which boosts the US semiconductor industry, at a cost over 10 years of about $2tn (£1.57tn).</p> <p>IRA subsidies and tax breaks on their own, which were originally estimated to cost $385bn, are, according to <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/americas-inflation-reduction-act-one-year-on/\">some analysts</a>, on track to hit $3tn if the US reaches one of the legislation’s main targets – reducing the electricity industry’s emissions to 25% of its 2022 total.</p> <p>To rival the US effort, the EU has put together the £600bn <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/eu-borrower-investor-relations/nextgenerationeu_en\">NextGenerationEU fund</a> to finance the green and digital transitions. It sounds large but is stretched over 27 countries and will need to be supplemented by private funds to achieve its aims.</p> <p>The UK, meanwhile, is taking a piecemeal approach with one-off subsidies that amount to a few billion pounds. Labour’s £28bn green investment fund is larger – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/19/labour-to-hold-crunch-talks-on-future-of-28bn-green-investment-plan#:~:text=Labour%20to%20hold%20crunch%20talks%20on%20future%20of%20%C2%A328bn%20green%20investment%20plan,-Sources%20say%20no&amp;amp;text=Senior%20Labour%20officials%20are%20to,to%20ditch%20the%20entire%20plan.\">if it is not scaled down any further before the election</a> – and based on a more coherent industrial strategy, yet still looks puny in a global context.</p> <p>That leaves the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, like all her counterparts in the industrialised world, needing huge amounts of private capital to get investment moving.</p> <p>The subsidies demanded by the owner of British Steel, China’s Jingye Group, and the Port Talbot steelworks owner Tata to switch from coal to electric furnaces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/23/uk-steel-industry-green-transition-jeremy-hunt-british-steel-tata\">have been eye-watering</a>, and give a taste of what is to come.</p> <p>Green bonds and infrastructure bonds, which generate money for projects that aim to reduce emissions, are seen as a significant funding source, but have proved to be very expensive and the price is likely to stay high, limiting their attraction.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, has flagged a solution that is likely to become increasingly popular in government circles: offering credits in return for green commitments from the private sector.</p> <p>That’s what <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/climate-change/climate-adaptation/london-climate-resilience-review\">the London climate resilience review</a>, authored by former Environment Agency boss Emma Howard Boyd, suggests can be used to generate investment in the capital. In an interim report last week, she suggested offering credits to buyers such as private landlords, local authorities, or utilities companies such as Thames Water, if they undertake work at their own cost to produce “a measurable reduction” in the area of impermeable surfaces that exacerbate flooding.</p> <p>These credits could last ­decades and be used to offset the bad behaviour of the buyer – say, the carbon-generating aspects of the business – as it seeks to achieve net zero. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Blair government, realising much of the past wealth had been sold, turned to the future, selling licences to mobile phone ­companies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Carbon credits have been around for some time and are not uncontroversial. The credits are based on markets that critics say price them too cheaply, meaning large industrial firms can afford to buy them and carry on much as before. </p> <p>Howard Boyd says there are ways to make sure credits connected to infrastructure projects in London would not be abused. She also recommends further research into “financial models that create markets for investment in nature-based&nbsp;solutions”.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the UK paid its way by selling – at a huge discount – dozens of state-owned assets, from North Sea oil and gas rights to British Telecom, BP and British Airways. In the 1990s came the privatisation of the rail network and National Grid. The Blair government, realising much of the past wealth had been sold, turned to the future, ­selling licences (to mobile phone companies) and long-term contracts, such as the ill-fated<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/18/taxpayers-to-foot-200bn-bill-for-pfi-contracts-audit-office\"> private finance initiative</a>.</p> <p>There is even less state cash to play with these days if we accept that entrenched political interests prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/02/if-taxing-the-rich-is-so-fraught-maybe-we-need-a-rethink\">reform of the tax system</a> and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/13/watch-out-rachel-reeves-the-old-guard-is-ganging-up-on-your-borrowing-ambitions\">state borrowing has limits</a>.

            "body" : "<p>As the adage goes: good things come in small packages. According to alcohol industry experts British consumers are increasingly choosing to enjoy their beverages in smaller portions, but of higher quality – fuelling a trend for 100ml taster bottles.</p> <p>The shift comes from a desire to be healthier, experts say, with drinking among UK teenagers and young people falling. In June 2023, Tesco sold 25% more low- and non-alcoholic beer than in dry January.</p> <p>Richard Halstead, the chief operating officer for consumer research at drinks market analysts IWSR, said: “We are certainly seeing smaller pack formats launched across categories to cater to moderation trends and also financial factors. These smaller sizes lower the cost barriers to entry and encourage the trial of new products or categories.”</p> <p>He added: “The evidence from mainstream wines suggests that consumers see smaller servings (eg cans) of wine generally as convenient, and promote the idea of portion control, but are reluctant to buy them as they often don’t represent good value compared with a standard bottle.”</p> <p>Halstead said that with fine wine “this innovative approach makes a lot of sense in terms of the moderation drivers, as wine is a category that due to packaging norms caters less to moderation.”</p> <p>He added: “You typically either need to be able to share a bottle or be able to finish it within a couple of days. These smaller formats which enable a consumer to have a smaller portion of premium quality products cater to the motivations to drink less, but not compromise on the quality of a product.”</p> <p>Matt Day, the owner of Daygustation, an independent wine shop and bar in east London, said: “Drinking a whole bottle just doesn’t fit with the healthy lifestyles of many people these days, yet until now very few decent wines have been available in a small format.”</p> <p>Day’s shop has started offering handcrafted and fine wines, apart from sparkling ones, in 100ml “taste tubes”. They can be taken away in the 100ml tubes with prices from £5 for Azevedo Vinho Verde 2022 (a bottle is £14.95).</p> <p>Naked Wines, an online wine retailer, also offers packs of 100ml pouches for its tasting events, sent out by post. This Christmas it also launched its first Advent calendar with samples in it, which sold out within weeks.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer said sales of its small wine bottles (25cl) had increased by 30% year on year, with wine cans showing similar growth over the same period. It sells four different sparkling wines and seven still wines in half bottles.</p> <p>It is not just winemakers going smaller. Cotswolds Distillery has launched a full-strength gin, designed to reduce the amount needed in a gin and tonic. It does this while keeping the strong flavour. Craft beer in 330ml cans is also a top seller.</p> <p>Law changes are also helping, with variations in the sizes of bottles available. In December, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/27/pint-of-wine-anyone-uk-looks-to-bring-back-silly-measure\">government gave the green light</a> for sstill and sparkling wine to be sold in 200ml, 500ml and 568ml (pint) sizes in 2024, alongside existing measures.</p> <p>Mark Driver, who co-owns the wine business Rathfinny, now sells 50cl sparkling wine bottles. He said: “Young wine drinkers care about where wine comes from and its quality. They seem to have more interest in the craft, and drink less than the millennials. I am not sure why but perhaps it started with craft beer and gin and has spread to wine.”</p> <p>It comes after researchers at the University of Cambridge found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/18/the-end-of-the-large-wine-experts-say-health-measure-would-not-harm-pubs#:~:text=Researchers%20found%20that%20removing%20the,positive%20effect%20on%20their%20bodies.\">taking the largest serving of wine – usually 250ml – off bar menus</a> could help the nation’s health and would not hurt pubs’ profits.</p> <p>Ryan Chetiyawardana, a bartender at the Lyaness and Seed Library bars in London, said there had “certainly been a shift from bigger drinks to more balanced ones in a wider sense – this has always been part of the cocktail bar world, but it’s starting to be adopted across the board as more venues focus on the quality of their offerings.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>A popular Caribbean rum has been rebranded after concerns were raised that its name was associated with slavery.</p> <p>Maison Ferrand, which markets itself as one of the world’s premier boutique producers of fine spirits, has changed the name of its Plantation rum to Planteray rum.</p> <p>The original name was criticised in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 for its links to the transatlantic slave trade. The change was promised in June 2020 and the company said trademarking the new name in 120 countries had caused delay.</p> <p>The announcement was made by the Maison Ferrand owner, Alexandre Gabriel, at a press conference at the West Indies Rum Distillery in Barbados this month.</p> <p>He said the new name “pays homage to sugar cane, the plant that gives birth to the rum, and the sun’s rays that are essential for sugar cane growth and ripening”.</p> <p>The announcement did not address the racism complaints made about the original name, and there were no official social media posts about the rebranding.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by Rachelle Ferron, the head of entertainment at ITV’s Good Morning Britain, who wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/25/plantations-slaves-brand-rum-shutters\">piece for the Guardian in 2022</a> in which she cited the brand in a critique of “businesses [that] still feel the need to use ‘plantation’ as a selling point despite its links to historic colonial exploitation”.</p> <p>Ferron said: “This is a welcome advancement, and I am proud that I was integral to this long-overdue change, but there is still work to do and I would urge any company to remove associations with slavery from their branding. This was my own little protest but that’s how wider change often starts.”</p>    <p>A Maison Ferrand spokesperson said the company would not be commenting further on the rebranding.</p> <p>Announcing the decision to change the drink’s name in June 2020, Gabriel, the rum’s creator and master blender, <a href=\"https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/8936/Plantation_Rum_to_change_name_in_support_of_racial_equality.html\">said</a>: “We understand the hurtful connotation the word ‘plantation’ can evoke to some people, especially in its association with much graver images and dark realities of the past.</p> <p>“We look to grow in our understanding of these difficult issues and while we don’t currently have all the details of what our brand name evolution will involve, we want to let everyone know that we are working to make fitting changes.”</p> <p>In a 2022 interview for the magazine <a href=\"https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10325/Alexandre_Gabriel_on_renaming_Plantation_Rum\">Drinks International</a>, Gabriel said the inspiration for the original name was his childhood in rural France.</p> <p>He said the word plantation was “a French farming term”and the name was chosen “without any malice and never with any intent to make anyone feel marginalised”.</p> <p>This is not the first time a rum producer has changed the name of a product because of criticism about an association with slavery. Two years ago, the Danish company 1423 World Class Spirits <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1423.dk/videos/-name-change-ron-esclavo-is-slowly-but-surely-changing-its-name-to-patridom-we-d/487224442745083/\">rebranded its Ron Esclavo rum</a> to Patridom after criticism of the original name, which means slave rum, and the firm’s <a href=\"https://www.ronesclavo.com/\">claim</a> that it was “an homage to the slaves who paid a high price in the history of sugar cane and rum”.</p> <p>Ferron called on other rum producers to rebrand products linked to slavery. She criticised Diageo for retaining the <a href=\"https://www.diageo.com/en/our-brands/brand-explorer/captain-morgan\">Captain Morgan brand</a>, named after <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146662323\">Sir Henry Morgan</a>, a privateer and plantation owner who owned more than 100 enslaved people.</p> <p>A Diageo spokesperson said: “Captain Morgan rum was created around 80 years ago and acquired by Diageo in 2001, and there has never been any legal or financial link between the brand and Henry Morgan, who lived in the 17th century.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose is considering cutting up to 11,000 staff jobs in the next five years, after the retail group slashed redundancy terms this week.</p> <p>Sources said at least 10% of the staff-owned business’s 76,000-strong workforce could go across the group’s head office, supermarkets and department stores.</p> <p>Department heads are working on plans and the number of roles in the business is expected to be gradually reduced over several years via redundancies and not replacing staff who leave, sources said.</p> <p>John Lewis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/16/john-lewis-group-loss-waitrose-sales-fall-no-staff-bonus\">warned about potential job cuts</a> in March last year as part of a plan to reduce costs and use technology to improve efficiency. The group has already cut thousands of jobs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/24/john-lewis-to-close-eight-more-stores-putting-1500-jobs-at-risk\">partly through store closures</a>, including 16 department stores and several supermarkets, over the past few years.</p> <p>One well-placed source said John Lewis executives had discussed cutting as many as 11,000 roles as part of its latest turnaround plan – amid rising pay and other costs and poor sales. Another said this figure had been briefed to select staff by some managers as the company battles to bounce back from a £230m full-year loss.</p> <p>The scale of potential job cuts emerged after the John Lewis Partnership (JLP), which is owned by its staff via a trust, wrote to workers this week telling them it was cutting the terms of its redundancy package in half – offering one week of pay a year of service instead of two for anyone being made redundant from 1 February.</p> <p>One member of staff, known as partners because of they co-own the business, said the announcement of a cut was particularly galling as it came shortly after a number of senior executives had left on the more generous deal.</p> <p>JLP told staff it was making the change as the current package was “higher than typical market practice and comes at a very high cost”. It said it needed to “free up cash” with a “more affordable” policy.</p> <p>The company offers the “partnership redundancy pay” package on top of statutory redundancy pay which is set by the government at one week a year of service for over 22s and 1.5 weeks for those over 41, capped at a maximum of just over £19,000.</p> <p>In an internal memo issued on Thursday, first reported by the Telegraph, the John Lewis Partnership said: “Against all of our competing priorities for investment, it’s fair to say that the high cost of redundancy pay has been one of the things that’s prevented us from moving as quickly as we’ve wanted to transform ourselves for the future, and has restricted our ability to invest more in pay.”</p> <p>It added that it was raising the minimum redundancy payment for those who did not qualify for the full partnership package from one week’s pay to four weeks to “better support those with shorter service who are affected by redundancy”.</p> <p>The announcement prompted a flurry of furious posts on the group’s internal messaging board with one worker saying: “Another example of major changes being made which will affect partners without a dialogue with partners.”</p> <p>Some called for an emergency meeting of the group’s partnership council, which gives the owner-workers a democratic voice via elected representatives from across the business.</p> <p>One member of staff told the Guardian: “We are held up as a better way of doing business and this just sits uncomfortably particularly when you take into account the recent wave of leadership level [redundancies].”</p> <p>A spokesperson for JLP said: “What we are doing is cost-neutral and it is a rebalancing because any saving on redundancy pay will be directly reinvested into partner pay.”</p> <p>The news on cutting redundancy terms was sent out via an email and then posted on the company intranet with staff not informed of any discussion at the partnership council.</p> <p>JLP said the issue had been put to the council and the group’s democratic processes had been followed but the meeting had not been livestreamed to staff.</p>",

Here we look at what agreements have been struck so far and with whom, and which other important economies are still at the negotiating table and why. </p> <h2><strong>Trade deals agreed so far</strong></h2> <p><strong>Japan</strong> When in late 2020 the then international secretary, Liz Truss, signed the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/11/uk-government-historic-trade-deal-japan-brexit\">first major post-Brexit free trade agreement</a>, she said that when it came into force the next year it would boost trade between the two countries by billions of pounds annually. </p> <p>However, exports to Japan have not quite received the turbo charge promised, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/26/brexit-britain-japan-trade-deal-exports-slump\">falling to £11.9bn</a> in the year to June 2022, from £12.3bn the year before. This included a 4.9% fall in export for goods, to £6.1bn, while services fell 2%, to £5.8bn.</p> <p><strong>Australia </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/17/uk-australia-trade-deal-is-more-golden-duck-than-golden-goose\">deal in December 2021</a> was almost entirely focused on goods, with tariffs being eliminated on exports from both countries for a 15-year period. The government said it would unlock £10.4bn of additional trade with the country by the 2030s while ending tariffs on all UK exports.</p> <p>Others were not so positive, with UK farmers angry that Australia had been given full access to sell beef and sheep meat in the UK while there was a ban on beef going the other way. A year later, George Eustice, the former environment minister who was part of the negotiations, said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/14/flagship-post-brexit-australia-trade-deal-not-actually-very-good-george-eustice\">“was not actually a very good deal for Britain”</a> and “gave away far too much for far too little in return”.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand </strong>This February 2022 deal largely mirrored the Australian one, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/20/uk-strikes-trade-deal-with-new-zealand-but-it-may-add-nothing-to-gdp\">similar concerns from UK meat farmers</a> about being undercut by cheaper imports. Tariffs of up to 10% on products were removed from most products, while visa restrictions for travel and residency were eased. </p> <p>The government estimated that this would add £800m a year to the UK economy by the mid-2030s but the overall impact was negligible, representing just <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-9487/CBP-9487.pdf\">a 0.03% boost to GDP by 2035</a>. The Australian and New Zealand trade deals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/31/uk-post-brexit-trade-deals-with-australia-and-new-zealand-kick-in\">came into effect in last May</a>.</p> <p><strong>The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership </strong>While technically not a new trade deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/31/uk-joins-asia-pacific-cptpp-trade-bloc-that-includes-japan-and-australia\">the UK’s joining of the CPTPP</a> means a range of export products can be traded tariff-free with the member nations, which include Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada and Mexico but not the US. The deal, agreed last March, also means countries must adhere to certain unified regulations, such as food standards. </p> <p>However, the CPTPP arrangements can be overridden by individual trade deals with specific countries, which is why the UK is still trying to secure direct deals with member states such as Canada. Analysis has found that exporting to countries in the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019, less than the UK’s total trade with Germany.</p> <h2><strong>The deals still not struck</strong></h2> <p><strong>The US </strong>Negotiations began in May 2020 and nearly four years later there is no prospect of an agreement any time soon. Last month Joe Biden signalled he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/18/joe-biden-signals-he-has-no-interest-in-signing-us-uk-trade-agreement\">shelved plans for a deal</a> until at least after this November’s US presidential election.</p> <p><strong>India </strong>When negotiations began between India and the UK at the start of 2022, it was hoped that by as early as that October there would be a deal reducing tariffs on exports such as cars and Scottish whisky and providing better access to the world’s fifth biggest economy. However, we are still waiting, with experts saying any pact is unlikely before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/31/bjp-modi-india-general-election-2024\">Indian national elections this spring</a>.</p> <p><strong>Others </strong>As well as Canada, talks are continuing with other nations including Israel, Mexico and South Korea. The UK began negotiating with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in July 2022. Experts have predicted that a deal with Switzerland, which is the sixth biggest market for the UK to export services to, could be the next reached.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Vodafone should be forced to spin off its most sensitive activities in order to quash national security concerns raised by a United Arab Emirates-backed telecoms group swooping on its shares, government officials have told the Guardian.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/25/emirates-backed-stake-vodafone-security-risk-uae-uk-government\">announced on Wednesday</a> that the deal involving Emirates Telecommunications Group building a 14.6% stake in Vodafone presented a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-rights-and-interests-conferred-to-emirates-telecommunications-group-company-pjsc-under-the-strategic-relationship-agreement-with-vodafone-group-pl/the-rights-and-interests-conferred-to-emirates-telecommunications-group-company-pjsc-under-the-strategic-relationship-agreement-with-vodafone-group-pl\">“national security risk” to the UK</a> due to Vodafone’s role “as a strategic supplier of services” to government departments, including those “which are in support of national security”.</p> <p>Dowden said on Friday the government had reached an agreement on measures to manage security risks, without giving details. The government “has put in place proportionate measures to address any potential national security concerns”, he said, adding that the UK was “rightly a magnet for global investment”.</p> <p>However, officials and sources familiar with operations at Vodafone said breaking off some operations would still be safest for the UK.</p> <p>Concern is understood to centre on a division called Vodafone Business Security Enhanced (VBSE).<strong> </strong>It<strong> </strong>works on some of the most sensitive tech used by the government and its security agencies, sources told the Guardian, including the Ministry of Defence, Foreign Office, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.</p> <p>The work is so sensitive that most of VBSE’s government-linked contracts are not publicly listed and some of its staff are vetted to hold high-level security clearance.</p> <p>The government has not mandated the spin-off of VBSE. However, sources said a full separation might be the best solution to protect the national security functions that VBSE undertakes.</p> <p>A large proportion of VBSE’s UK workers are based in Hampshire in what the company describes as a “mini-Fort Knox”.</p> <p>Many of its staff have backgrounds in the military, intelligence services or other sensitive areas of government. Its head, Steve Knibbs, who worked at GCHQ for several years after serving in the British military, also chairs the national security committee of the of industry body TechUK.</p> <p>Vodafone’s work ranges from mobile networks for civil servants to the ownership and maintenance of subsea cables and services for the UK’s military court service. The service’s hearings are sometimes highly sensitive, involving risks to national security or military operations, and can be held in private. They can also take place anywhere in the world, requiring secure IT support. Defendants and advocates often appear via video link.</p> <p>The terms of the deal between Vodafone and Emirates Telecoms, also known as e&amp;, allow the latter to add an additional executive to the board if its ownership rises above 20%. It can increase its ownership to nearly 25%.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said in a statement on Wednesday that the tie-up would allow e&amp; to “materially influence policy at Vodafone”.</p> <p>The statement also laid out requirements for Vodafone to set up “a national security committee to oversee sensitive work that Vodafone and its group perform which has an impact on or is in respect of the national security of the United Kingdom”. </p> <p>Scrutiny has been rising over a range of UK deals backed by the gulf state. This includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/26/telegraph-takeover-second-investigation-launched-into-barclay-familys-uae-backed-deal\">UAE-backed purchase of the Telegraph and Spectator groups</a>. The deal would allow RedBird IMI, which derives most of its funding from Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the UAE and owner of Manchester City football club, to take a controlling stake in the national newspaper and magazine groups.</p> <p>RedBird IMI has said it would be a “passive investor” once it took ownership of the titles.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office declined to comment.</p> <p>A Vodafone spokesperson said: “Vodafone is not considering any change to Vodafone Business Security Enhanced and is not in discussion to spin off the organisation. VBSE is a 24/7 business unit, which has technical operational separation, delivering end-to-end and managed security services to private and public organisations in the UK.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Joe Biden has, at least for a while, defused a ticking carbon bomb. Climate activists and the fossil fuel industry are now left wondering how long it will last.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/26/biden-delays-cp2-louisiana-lng-export-project\">The decision on Friday by the Biden administration to pause</a> all pending export licenses for liquified natural gas (LNG) to consider the climate impact of the projects has been hailed as a momentous shift in the status quo by those concerned by the unfolding climate crisis.</p> <p>“World leaders agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the Cop28 climate negotiations last year and president Biden’s decision today to pause new permits for LNG exports shows that he is taking that pledge seriously,” Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said.</p> <p>From nothing a decade ago, the US now has <a href=\"https://cms.ferc.gov/media/us-lng-export-terminals-existing-approved-not-yet-built-and-proposed\">eight LNG export terminals</a> and is the world’s largest exporter of the gas, which is extracted, piped, chilled and sent overseas on ships. The pace of growth is extraordinary – the Calcasieu Pass 2 (or CP2) project, a vast planned hub on Louisiana’s coast, would ship up to 24m tons of LNG each year once built and become one of the biggest such terminals in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2024/jan/23/exxonmobils-attempt-to-silence-activist-investors-should-be-a-warning-to-shareholders\">ExxonMobil’s attempt to silence activist investors should be a warning to shareholders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>CP2 is at the vanguard of a frenzy of new gas export infrastructure along the Gulf of Mexico coast that would, if fully realized, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/23/louisiana-gas-export-hub-biden-climate-crisis\">result in an estimated 3.2bn tons of greenhouse gases each year</a>, close to the annual emissions of the entire European Union and severely imperiling hopes of avoiding catastrophic global heating.</p> <p>Stopping CP2 and a dozen or so other proposed gas facilities has become a priority issue for US environmentalists and Biden’s decision, which should delay projects until after the November presidential election, provoked jubilation. The delay is “the biggest thing a US president has ever done to stand up to the fossil fuel industry”, <a href=\"https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/um-i-think-we-all-just-won?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=438146&amp;post_id=141009145&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=7zc5r&amp;utm_medium=email\">according</a> to Bill McKibben, the veteran climate campaigner.</p> <p>Biden has come under severe progressive pressure over the gas buildout, which only heightened after his administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/14/biden-president-approved-alaska-willow-project\">approved</a> the controversial Willow oil project in Alaska. The world cannot afford any new major fossil fuel projects if it is to avoid dangerous global temperature rises, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found.</p> <p>CP2, which would have an emissions impact 20 times larger than that of Willow, has therefore become framed as a test of Biden’s climate credentials before an election where he will be looking for the votes of those concerned about global heating while also fending off Republican attacks over energy costs and the need to supply European allies with gas in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Key questions remain unanswered, such as whether the delay is merely a tactic to remove an awkward issue before November or if it will lead to a more lasting reform of federal permitting that explicitly accounts for climate change concerns alongside more nebulous “public interest” criteria that <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/gillian-giannetti/us-gas-policy-fell-flat-2023-climate-demands-better\">haven’t been updated</a> since the 1980s.</p> <p>US government agencies have, until now, typically disregarded climate as an issue when waving through oil and gas facilities and pipelines. That looks like it may change.</p>    <p>“To preserve a livable planet, we need a public interest test that denies any new project that would drive us further into climate catastrophe and violate US commitments to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Jean Su, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy justice program.</p> <p>Climate considerations should slow but would likely not stop the growth of an LNG export industry that is set to double in size over the next four years, according to Jeff Navin, who was chief of staff at the energy department during Barack Obama’s administration.</p> <p>“It’s not shocking the administration would at least consider the impacts of these projects on climate change and it’s entirely possibly they could decide they are a net positive for the climate because the gas would displace dirtier coal overseas,” said Navin, now a <a href=\"https://www.boundarystone.com/people/jeff-navin\">consultant</a>.</p> <p>“Not every terminal is going to be stopped. But it’s going to put pressure on facilities to think about how gas is produced and transported in terms of methane leaks.”</p> <p>While the delay has been welcomed by climate activists, it will likely prove ammunition for the fossil fuel industry and its Republican allies including Donald Trump, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/18/trump-republican-rivals-climate-crisis\">vowed to “drill, baby, drill”</a> and attacked Biden for hindering the industry, even amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/27/us-oil-gas-record-fossil-fuels-cop28-united-nations\">record glut of oil and gas production</a>.</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, said that the pause is “directly at odds with America’s interests on the world stage”. A coalition of oil and gas industry groups has <a href=\"https://www.api.org/~/media/files/news/2024/01/24/industry-groups-lng-letter-january-24\">written to the Biden administration</a> to complain that the decision will “only bolster Russian influence” and risk American jobs.</p> <p>Critics, however, point to <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/IIF_LNG/pdf/LNG_Issue_in_Focus.pdf\">evidence</a> that boosting LNG exports drives up domestic gas prices for Americans and that the raft of planned terminals would take several years to build anyway, beyond a 2027 timeframe in which European Union countries have <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/it/statement_22_2041\">vowed</a> to end reliance upon Russian gas and pivot to renewable energy. According to the IEA, European gas demand will <a href=\"https://u12097671.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=9rudYHeevExQpJ5A1h-2BA7UcWCigbMnqAkTcqiWxiR1N6Sv4Zu8o9MEibdOe8-2Fope0XvplkpFjl8-2F6p4QDs-2BylxSPE5wtsdwZ7NBz9FKuOxc-3D_YHI_k1c8dtyP9W2hf1GXby-2FtBTgQy05M8Bs9UWD1u6BQiKPfQp9OCckf-2BVykj5TBUDR-2FYDpp-2F88wvrdJpzDJFV6JnB1qgCVo9kOeEe8HIT6SW60ieInkzXBjBUHelnD2-2B1dyVBqFtud-2BFpZrXdZvaXQCLfYfJ6mumekZXfOgNwJbN6B-2BUN7Uf0NtXWYjSEiqPwvyxqYK5Ac-2FcMXmmvq2n1fNF9ShPH9HDpJiF2BUFc73hq9-2FnpQU1novPog0yEnskhnaW7SgkafMUaGZ-2BhLCQFLAKfanLoPZhlMVanh-2BE9h9MrUDL5g82xwxTISyMUJHBpijPeAc4C-2FA0XmNj9EXkmtqq3NebtpC9gF07JqCaSyfvhJD8K6ltd6elE4-2BC2fdops2n9JFOnoQUh3p3c8GibYQ7J35XnHjrXV-2BhKkHFr0o7qFLCpbouNqvFpPMFewHx4DLCqcANX7-2FD1x5ht722yy35Y6y5DRnbzyq-2F2xTCAPZdmDcYBZNfqOrazVlSeimU-2BfNBawjoDyDp9OJbR5j7TAOv8eksdd7x7BKZAVR-2FEjY1lKHwGchvlKN3xk2h49-2BvodGNRSkjFZZDw8V-2FWy3YrkDZw-3D-3D\">fall 8%</a> by 2026.</p> <p>“Expanding LNG infrastructure in the USA and in the EU is a high economic risk that will very likely end up as stranded assets,” warned Claudia Kemfert, an economic expert at the German Institute for Economic Research and Leuphana University in Germany.</p> <p>For those living amid the tumult of new gas infrastructure along the Gulf coast, the pause is a relief, if a rather tenuous one. The terminals could still be built even with Biden as president, and will almost certainly go ahead if Trump is to win the election.</p> <p>“A pause can be unpaused anytime,” said Travis Dardar, a fisherman in Louisiana who has campaigned against the LNG expansion in his community.</p> <p>“We know first-hand how ruthless these gas export companies can be. They shoved these gas export terminals down our throats, destroying our fishing grounds, clogging the channel we use with their massive tankers, and constantly sending poisonous smoke into our air.”</p> <p>Biden, Dardar said, needs to “deny all gas export terminals, and let this sinking industry fall to the bottom of the sea”.</p>",

And we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made.</p> <p>“We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”</p> <p>The talks, which started in March 2022, are among a number of negotiations Britain has launched around the world after its decision to leave the European Union, which excluded it from existing EU free trade deals.</p> <p>The previous agreement had allowed the UK to continue to sell cars and cheese in Canada without it charging import tax. However, Canada’s government has been facing pressure from the beef industry and domestic cheesemakers.</p> <p>The UK had been trading with Canada on terms that largely replicated the arrangements in place from the UK’s time in the EU.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Canadian trade minister, Mary Ng, said: “We are disappointed that negotiations with the UK are being paused. Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/23/hard-cheese-canada-rejects-british-attempt-to-secure-tariff-free-exports\">Hard cheese: Canada rejects British attempt to secure tariff-free exports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ng has contacted the British business minister, Kemi Badenoch, to express Canada’s disappointment, the spokesperson added.</p> <p>Before Britain left the EU at the end of 2020, Canada rolled over existing trade arrangements to ensure free trade could continue.</p> <p>One arrangement dealing with cheese access has expired and a Canadian government official blamed Britain for the lack of an extension deal.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, Britain did not act as fast as it should have in negotiations, and expects Canada to just give [it] these things,” an official told the Reuters news agency.</p> <p>Both sides said they were ready to resume talks. According to official British data, total bilateral trade in goods and services was £25.9bn in the year ending 30 June 2023, when Canada was Britain’s 18th largest trading partner.</p> <p>A farmers’ leader said it was essential that hormone-treated beef was not allowed into Britain.</p> <p>Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union of England and Wales, said the stopping of the trade talks was “a relief for farmers”.</p> <p>She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This has been going on for a long time and it is about enhancing the trading relationship between the UK and Canada.</p> <p>“Trade on agricultural products is always the first thing to be discussed and the last thing to be agreed. I am pleased the government has stuck to its line and not given way.”</p> <p>Batters told the programme: “Canada has used cheese as a sort of negotiating lever. We lost market access at the end of 2023 and then they put it into these enhanced discussions.”</p> <p>She added: “The prime minister put it in writing last year that he would not be importing hormone-treated beef or chlorine washed chicken.</p> <p>“Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.”</p> <p>According to Canadian data, bilateral trade with Britain in 2022 accounted for 2.7% of its total.</p> <p>Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour’s shadow business and trade secretary, said: “This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises. Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit, these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector.”</p> <p>“This is another blow to the British economy because of Conservative incompetence. It is clear that they are unable to deliver what we need to get our economy growing.</p> <p>“Labour would pursue a proper trade strategy, focusing on the UK’s strengths and working to ensure trade supports our industrial and foreign policy objectives while protecting our high standards.”</p>",

The Fed’s inflation forecasts are stil too high – the December [summary of economic projections] shows core PCE inflation running above the 2% target until Q4 2026 – and will be revised down again in March, for the third successive quarter, giving the Fed the necessary hook on which to hang the first rate cut, either at that meeting or in May.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In the UK</strong>, the car industry has expressed its displeasure at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/26/uk-suspends-trade-talks-canada-no-progress-details-agriculture-markets\">breakdown in talks with </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/26/uk-suspends-trade-talks-canada-no-progress-details-agriculture-markets\">Canada</a></strong> over a trade deal to replace the pre-Brexit EU arrangement.</p> <p>That gave zero tariffs for exports to Canada, but that deal will lapse in April, with little prospect of an agreement before then.

Superdry said he had a “strong track record in consumer-facing businesses where he has operated successfully in turnaround environment”.</p> <p>Superdry warned it was facing another tough year in which it expected results “to reflect the more challenging environment seen to date”.</p> <p>In delayed half-year results published on Friday, the company said sales fell 23.5% in the six months to 28 October. In the following 12 weeks to 20 January, sales were down 13.7% led by a 38% dive in wholesale sales.</p> <p>The group dropped to a loss of £25.3m in the half-year, before a £36.3m one-off benefit, principally the sale of its brand rights in south-east Asia. A year before, the group made a £13.6m underlying loss.</p> <p>Superdry said its sales had been affected by the “milder autumn that persisted through the peak Christmas trading period”. It added that weak consumer demand had also led to “heavy discounting across the sector”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/19/superdry-warns-on-profits-weather-sales-shares\"> The company had warned</a> before Christmas that profits would be affected by the mild weather but did not give a figure.</p> <p>Julian Dunkerton, the founder and chief executive who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/02/superdry-julian-dunkerton-rejoin-board\">returned to Superdry via a boardroom coup in 2019</a> to try to turn the business around, said: “This has clearly been a difficult period for Superdry. A challenging consumer retail market, set against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and some remarkably unseasonal weather conditions have all combined to weaken the financial performance of the group.</p> <p>“These macro and external factors have been further exacerbated by the underperformance of our wholesale segment. While, to some extent, this was expected due to the decision to exit our US operations and the sale of the brand rights in non-core territories, the segment continues to prove challenging.”</p> <p>He added that the group had made “significant operational strides” despite its “near-term difficulties”. Wholesale sales were affected by a decision to exit the US and “structural changes to the broader market” such as the closure of many department stores.</p> <p>Superdry said it had stepped up efforts to save costs as it remained almost £29m in debt at the end of its half-year, an improvement from the £38m of net debt a year before.</p> <p>The company now expects to make £40m in savings this financial year, £5m more than previously expected. It is also looking to sell its brand rights in further territories and sell off old stock in order to raise cash to reduce its debts.</p> <p>Russell Pointon, the director of consumer and media at Edison Group, said:<strong> </strong>“Today’s results, against the backdrop of the recent profit warning and the announcement of PwC’s involvement in reviewing debt-raising options, underscore the magnitude of challenges Superdry confronts in its quest for financial stability.”</p> <p>The widening losses and falling sales continue a tough period for the brand, which has been struggling to engineer a turnaround for several years.</p> <p>It is understood that it hired the advisory firm PwC before Christmas to review options for handling its debts, with the company saying on Friday that “cash management remains a critical focus area for the business”.</p> <p>By 23 January the group had just under £34m in cash and undrawn debt facilities of £12.4m.</p> <p>In May last year, the company raised about £12m from shareholders including Dunkerton before turning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/04/hilco-wilko-high-street-retailers\">restructuring specialist Hilco</a> in the summer for a £25m loan at a hefty interest rate of 10.5% plus the Bank of England base rate.

But Lagarde added: “We need to be further along the disinflation process to be confident that inflation will be at target – sustainably so.”</p> <p>Germany has fallen into recession and France has struggled to grow over the last year, prompting calls for interest rates cuts to boost economic growth.</p> <p>Michael Hewson, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said: “Germany is in an absolute hole with no prospect of getting out of it, and yet the ECB seem more worried about inflation than they are about a depression.”</p> <p>The ECB expects household and government spending to drive recovery but figures from the economy appear to be painting a bleaker picture, with manufacturing remaining in recession and services cooling.</p> <p>Lagarde said cuts to government energy subsidies could weaken the eurozone further, though disruption to shipping in the Red Sea could send inflation higher, complicating the situation. </p> <p>Higher import and export costs, pushing up shop prices, could prevent the ECB from reacting to weakening growth by lowering borrowing costs.</p> <p>Next week, the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates. However, comments from Jerome Powell, chair of the central bank, will be intensely scrutinised to assess when the bank might begin reducing the burden on borrowers.</p> <p>Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told Reuters: “It’s only fitting that a year that defied expectations would show growth that exceeded expectations. You have to squint to see weakness in the numbers. What’s not to like? </p> <p>“The problem for the market is that the Fed doesn’t have to be in a hurry to cut. Rather than cutting sooner and faster, the Fed can cut later and slower.”</p> <p>The US economy expanded by 3.3% in the last quarter of 2023, according to the annualised estimate for GDP, down from 4.9% in the previous quarter, but higher than expected by analysts.</p>",

Shops have said an increase in the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/01/major-uk-retail-bosses-plead-for-staff-protection-as-violent-criminals-empty-stores\">organised criminal gangs targeting stores</a> is also fuelling the problem.</p> <p>In October, Sharon White, the chair of the John Lewis department store group, which also owns the supermarket chain Waitrose, said some organised gangs were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/24/organised-gangs-are-shoplifting-to-order-in-uk-john-lewis-boss-says\">“shoplifting to order”</a> and targeting expensive items such as wines and spirits.</p> <p>Retailers say many cases are going unpunished, with Co-op Food revealing in September that police attended about <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/falling-food-inflation-linked-to-retailers-cutting-prices-not-costs-coming-down-co-op-ceo-warns-12966318\">two in 10</a> of the incidents its workers reported.</p> <p>To combat the growing problem, the government launched an action plan last October including measures such as the creation of a specialist team to target organised criminals behind targeted incidents, and pledges from police to prioritise responding to incidents where shop workers are attacked or where a security guard has detained an offender.</p> <p>But in the same month, the justice secretary, Alex Chalk, set out measures for criminals facing jail sentences of under 12 months to receive suspended sentences and community service, with shoplifters one of the groups of offenders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/dec/26/shoplifters-most-affected-by-ending-short-jail-sentences\">expected to benefit most from the change</a>.</p> <p>The overall number of crimes recorded by police in England and Wales in the year to September 2023 stood at 6.7m, up 1% from 6.6m in the previous year and higher than 6.1m in the pre-pandemic year of 2019-20.</p> <p>Catherine Grant, of the ONS, said there was a “mixed picture of crime” but that police-recorded crime was showing “notable increases in some theft offences, including shoplifting” as well as a rise in thefts of motor vehicles.</p> <p>The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “We’d always want to do more to combat shoplifting. I think there is work that has been done, particularly with private companies, about how we can go further to tackle this issue.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>In the wake of this week’s announcement (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/24/royal-mail-could-save-650m-by-switching-to-three-day-a-week-service-says-ofcom\">Royal Mail could save £650m by moving to three-day-a-week service, says Ofcom, 24 January</a>), maybe someone could send out a postie to knock on Vince Cable’s door for a comment or two.</p> <p>It was he who, as business secretary in the coalition government, oversaw the privatisation of Royal Mail, pledging that it would not threaten the universal service obligation to deliver to any home in the UK on six days a week. Indeed, Mr Cable went as far as claiming that securing that specified level of service provision was the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/10/royal-mail-privatisation-delivery-vince-cable\">overarching objective</a>” of privatisation – despite warnings to the contrary from unions, industry and other dissenting voices.</p> <p>But this somewhat inevitable outcome should come as no surprise. As we’ve seen with most privatisations in the UK, it’s never been about achieving a long-term sustainable business model, more responsive to the needs of the communities and ordinary people; it’s about making a quick buck and damn the consequences. The evidence abounds. Be it the privatised water companies, utilities, train companies or the Royal Mail – nobody delivers for the&nbsp;public any more. <br><strong>Colin Montgomery </strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>• Deliver three days a week? If only! Where we live, in north-west London, you’re lucky if you get mail delivered one day a week. And as for parcels, whistle for it. A once-edible birthday present that was sent on 9 January still hasn’t arrived. A book sent in November? Nix. A DVD sent two weeks ago? All I have is emails from eBay asking me to rate it. On one of my despairing visits to the local delivery office to pick up our mail (letters only – parcels vanish into a black hole), I asked why this is. The woman at the counter (open 8am-10am only) said that they used to have 15 posties, but eight were “let go”. If they’re going to run a <em>poste restante</em> service, why not say so and have done with it? At least then we’d know where we are.<br><strong>Ruth Brandon</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• I’m not sure what Ofcom is basing its plans on. Here in Portsmouth we are already on a three-days-a-week (or fewer) delivery schedule. It is not probable that we could get as many first-class letters in one delivery, all with different posting dates, if Royal Mail weren’t storing up post until there was enough volume to put a postie on the route.</p> <p>My retired parents, in a more rural location in Norfolk, don’t get deliveries more than once a week. They’ve taken to driving over to the local office every couple of days and collecting their mail. Even then letters are being lost for weeks.</p> <p>Before Christmas, a “Tracked&nbsp;48” parcel took six days to reach us. It was left in our recycling bin after we had already left for the holiday. It is fortunate that we have good neighbours who found it before the&nbsp;bins were emptied.<br><strong>David Hague</strong><br><em>Portsmouth</em></p> <p>• Any decent citizen should welcome the prime minister’s commitment to maintaining Royal Mail’s universal six-day delivery.</p> <p>However, constructive help is needed. The government should scrap the VAT on Royal Mail’s extra services such as the special delivery. A more sustainable service is good for small business customers, the lifeblood of our economy. Good communications and infrastructure such as the universal delivery are key.<br><strong>John Barstow</strong><br><em>Fittleworth, West Sussex</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

However, there is no guarantee that those new roles will be given to staff whose jobs are being cut.</p> <p>Lloyds is closing about 114 branches this year, leaving a network of 1,061 sites. The staff cuts will be aimed at senior branch workers, with Lloyds maintaining its most junior roles.</p> <p>The staff union, Accord, hopes most of the cuts <a href=\"https://accord-myunion.org/blog/lloyds-banking-group-announces-significant-changes-in-its-branch-networks\">will be on a voluntary redundancy</a> basis, where workers ask to leave and receive some compensation, though it is likely to be offered only in some cases.</p> <p>In November, Lloyds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/24/more-than-2500-jobs-at-risk-in-lloyds-shake-up\">confirmed plans to slash nearly 3,000 roles</a> from the wider business – excluding its branches – focusing on middle-management roles including analyst and product management posts. Again, the bank said it was creating thousands of positions that would ultimately result in a net 120 roles being added to its workforce.</p> <p>The job cuts are part of a £3bn overhaul announced under the chief executive, Charlie Nunn, in early 2022 in an attempt to push further into digital banking, bulk up the corporate bank and wealth division, and strengthen Lloyds’ position as a UK landowner.</p> <p>Commenting on the latest round of job losses, a Lloyds spokesperson said: “As more customers choose to manage their day-to-day banking online, it is important our people are available when it matters most. We are introducing a number of new roles and making changes to our branch teams so our customers can see us how and when they want to.”</p> <p>Accord said: “LBG announced significant changes to its branch network structure and ways of working, which it says are necessary because of changes in customer behaviour. The move represents a significant change to the branch networks and our members.”</p>",

In April, the company upped its stake to 14.6%, before entering a strategic partnership agreement under which the e&amp; chief executive, Hatem Dowidar, joined the Vodafone board.</p> <p>That move triggered the government to look into the deal under the National Security and Investment Act 2021, owing to Vodafone’s importance as strategic supplier of the UK government and being involved in the country’s cybersecurity infrastructure. However, the government had not previously made any public announcements saying it was looking into the partnership.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said the partnership would enable e&amp; to “materially influence policy at Vodafone”.</p> <p>Oliver Dowden, secretary of state at the Cabinet Office, has now made several orders, including requirements that the UK government is notified if any elements of the relationship changes. UK government requirements must also be met regarding Vodafone’s board composition and functions.</p> <p>Under the terms of the strategic partnership, e&amp; can increase its stake to just under 25%, while also having the opportunity to add another executive to the board if its ownership tops 20%.</p> <p>The state-owned firm has previously said it planned to be a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/uae-telecoms-group-raid-vodafone-shareholder\">long-term and supportive shareholder in Vodafone and is not seeking to exert control or influence the company’s board or management team”</a>. The company operates in 16 countries across the Middle East, Asia and Africa and has an estimated 164 million customers globally.</p> <p>A Vodafone spokesperson said: “We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e&amp;, and for e&amp; to take a seat on our board.” The Guardian contacted e&amp; for comment.</p> <p>The Vodafone agreement is one of several deals in recent years made by UAE-based companies and investment vehicles seeking to invest and grow their stakes in UK companies.</p> <p>Regulators have been looking into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/20/redbird-imi-telegraph-spectator-barclay-family-loans-debts\">prospective transfer of control over the Telegraph and Spectator</a> from the Barclay family to the Abu Dhabi-backed investment group RedBird IMI on public interest grounds.</p> <p>Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had been due to report on Friday, but are now likely to be asked to look again at the deal and report in mid-March if, as expected, a second investigation is launched after the culture secretary said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/24/telegraph-takeover-uk-government-intends-to-order-new-investigation-into-deal\">she was “minded to” issue a new public interest intervention notice</a>.</p> <p>Lucy Frazer made the announcement on Wednesday after a last-minute corporate structure change by RedBird raised fresh concerns.</p> <p>There has been outrage from some politicians – as well as former and current Telegraph journalists – about the deal, which would allow an overseas government to control a significant stake in a UK national newspaper.</p> <p>Vodafone also faces separate regulatory scrutiny over its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/vodafone-and-three-agree-merger-to-form-uk-largest-mobile-operator\">proposed £15bn merger deal </a>with a fellow telecoms company, Three.</p> <p>An investigation was launched by the CMA in October to look into whether the tie-up could affect consumer options and prices.

Managing director Don Meij convened a call with analysts and investors, and sought to explain the troubles.</p> <p>“It’s quite humbling to sit in front of you and to be able to share the disappointing results in part of our business today,” he said on the video conference. “It really shows a rollercoaster.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>While sales are growing strongly in Australia and New Zealand, backed by popular ranges of snack-sized pizza products, the same is not true of its French business or its operations in parts of Asia.</p> <p>Meij blamed enduring poor sales figures in France on “execution” problems, rather than any issues related to taste.</p> <p>“It’s very clear, we haven’t had success in France. That’s the one area of our business that we’ve rarely shown any bright lights,” he said.</p> <p>Even as Domino’s grows its business in neighbouring Germany, France has proven difficult. The company’s online delivery platform, which sits at the heart of the chain’s operations, was formerly felled by the regular usage of apostrophes in French addresses it struggled to read.</p> <p>Growth in Japan was also weaker than expected, especially in the important pre-<br>Christmas trading period, despite Domino’s using premium menu items such as a pizza rice bowl to drive sales.</p> <p>Domino’s has invested heavily in Japan, with mixed results, and without the apparent success of other American brands such as KFC, which has a passionate following there.</p> <p>Meij said anti-American sentiment in other parts of Asia were also hurting sales. “It’s well publicised that American brands in Asia, and I largely talk to Malaysia in this case, have been affected by what’s happening in the Middle East right now,” he said, referring to the fighting in Gaza.</p> <p>Major American brands, including McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, have been ostracised in some markets recently because of the US’s close ties to Israel.</p> <p>Domino’s aggressive global expansion has made it a very volatile stock, riding the highs and lows of market sentiment.</p> <p>Its share price briefly rose above $160 in the pandemic, as locked-down consumers ordered out en masse. Now hovering at $40, shares are trading at pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p>The pizza business walks a fine line between keeping meals affordable, and turning a profit. During the inflationary period, it faced steep increases in delivery costs and produce prices, including cheese, but customers reacted badly to a 7% delivery charge which was promptly scrapped.</p> <p>Brokers are concerned by the latest figures, with UBS holding a sell rating on the stock. Analysts at Citi moved their rating from “buy” to “neutral”.</p> <p>Meij assured shareholders on Thursday he was confident in the strength of the company’s balance sheet andthat the company retained the “full support” of its bank lenders.</p> <p>“We have underperformed and I don’t want to over promise,” Meij said. “We need to bring better results to the market.”</p>",

Since those earning less typically spend more of any tax relief, there will be some extra demand in the economy.<br><br>It is understood Treasury was first asked by the government to start considering changes to Stage 3 around Christmas. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese gave his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/04/labor-could-raise-welfare-payments-for-cost-of-living-relief-without-stoking-inflation-economists-say\">media conference on 3 January</a>, where he called on treasury and the finance department to provide ideas for easing cost of living pressures.</p> \n<p><strong>Among the work done was the first modelling of how stage 3 would affect participation in the labour market, filling a gap from the previous government.</strong></p> \n<p>Treasury determined that the difference between the tendency of middle income earners to consume and that of high income earners was too small to have an inflationary impact.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"96dc8541-2923-46c2-8e3e-cfc5ecc3a737\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n5VmvokSS1A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jonathan Kearns, who was the RBA’s head of domestic markets until joining Challenger as chief economist a year ago, said it would probably “take an analyst half a day to make a back-of-the-envelope” estimate about the cuts’ inflationary effect.</p> \n<p>In Treasury’s case, the modifications could be factored into a fiscal model and also one for the wider economy, Kearns said.</p> \n<p>“It’s obviously a political decision” for Treasury not to run the model even if the aggregate effect on prices is likely to be “pretty small”, he said.</p> \n<p>Warren Hogan, chief economist for Judo Bank, said it <strong>would be</strong> “surprising” Treasury hadn’t done specific modelling for inflation.</p> \n<p>“[It] suggests this has all happened in the past few weeks,” Hogan said. “As an experienced economists, one can do the simple arithmetic on the impacts on consumption and domestic demand pretty easily and quickly using a few plausible assumptions about propensity to consume and save at different income levels.”</p> \n<p>The RBA declined to comment.</p> \n<p>In the advice released on Thursday, Treasury said the redesign “will not impact the inflation outlook”.</p> \n<p>Inflation was projected to decline to 2.75% by June 2025, the advice shows, which would be well within the RBA’s 2% to 3% target range. The RBA will release its updated forecasts on 6 February, and may amend its prediction inflation will only slow to below 3% towards the end of 2025.</p> \n<p>According to its fiscal modelling, the tax cut rejig will boost tax receipts in the 2024-25 year by $1.3bn. This addition, though, would be reversed to produce a $1.3bn reduction in receipts in the forward estimates to 2027-28. By 2034-35, the budget would be “around $28bn” better off over the decade than if the original policy remained.</p> \n<p>There will also be a “small improvement” in bracket creep for the first seven income deciles over the next 10 years. “Under the recommended redesign, average tax rates for higher-income earners are still significantly reduced compared to a no change in taxes scenario but by less than under Stage 3 [as legislated],” the advice said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"27b2f7a7-cb24-4885-b0b8-ba1a7cb7b26f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1UEpe_l-aCU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More women and those with lower formal education would also be encouraged into the workforce, the advice states.</p> \n<p>“Women have lower labour force participation rates and, when employed, are more likely to work part-time,” the advice notes. “When faced with the same percentage change to after-tax wages, women – particularly women with children – are more responsive in the amount they work compared to men.”</p> \n<p>“The redesign is expected to produce a larger increase in labour supply, driven by increases in hours worked and participation of women with taxable income between $20,000 and $75,000,” the advice states. “Overall, the recommended redesign sees an increase in labour supply of about 930,000 hours per week (0.25%), more than double Stage 3. Female labour supply is expected to increase by 0.37%.”</p> \n<p>Judo’s Warren said that it was important that the package was “broadly revenue neutral”.</p> \n<p>“It has positive implications for labour supply, for example, which people often don’t factor into their thinking about this question,” he said.</p> \n<p>Kearns said it was clear that online interest in the tax cuts began picking up over January, with almost 10 times as many searches in the past week as in December.</p> \n<p>Investors, though, don’t expect the tax changes to be significant when it comes to what the RBA decides to do with interest rates. “If the stage-three tax cuts were expected to have a significant inflationary impetus then we’d expect to see expectations for the cash rate increase relative to those for the [US] Fed Funds rate, and there isn’t evidence of that.”</p> \n<p>Brendan Rynne, KPMG’s chief economist said the assessment the policy changes would be “cost-neutral” was “optimistic”. His initial analysis suggested there was “a risk it could cost more than the government is assuming”.</p> \n<p>“The changes are likely to be marginally more inflationary than the original stage 3 proposals, due to income shifting from higher income taxpayers (who are net savers) to lower income cohorts (net spenders),” Rynne said. “Inflation is already coming down fairly quickly – business surveys are showing this ahead of official data – so the danger is that by stoking aggregate demand, cost of living pressures will continue longer.”</p> \n<p>KPMG estimates the total cost of the package – including the amendments – to be between 0.5%-0.7% of GDP, and so it would be stimulatory for the economy.</p> \n<p>Luci Ellis, Westpac’s chief economist and formerly the RBA’s head economist, said “while the changes this week alter the distribution of the benefits, the macroeconomic impact of this – relative to the package as originally announced – is marginal”.</p> \n<p>“We do not expect that this will affect the RBA’s view of the inflation outlook or the future path of the cash rate,” Ellis said.</p> \n<p><em>-with Paul Karp</em></p>",

            "body" : "<p>A former post office operator has come forward claiming she was told British Asian women were often pushed into theft as auditors urged her to confess to stealing £30,000 – a charge of which she was later cleared.</p> <p>Before her trial in 1997, it was allegedly suggested to Kuldeep Kaur Atwal, then 46, that her cultural background may have played a role in her criminality and that she was likely to receive a custodial sentence unless she admitted to stealing from her branch.</p> <p>A jury at Coventry crown court was subsequently instructed by the judge, Richard Cole, to return a not guilty verdict due to lack of evidence but the Post Office went on to demand that Atwal pay the money she had been falsely accused of taking.</p> <p>Atwal, a mother of three, whose husband, Gurpal Singh Atwal, was a teacher, was contractually obliged to make good on shortfalls and had to quickly sell her branch for a fraction of its market value to pay off the debt.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Atwal said the auditor’s alleged comment had made her angry at the time but she had felt powerless to respond.</p> <p>The Post Office apologised last year after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/27/post-office-horizon-inquiry-used-racist-term-for-black-people-documents-show\">document was discovered</a> in which operators were categorised as “negroid types”, “Chinese/Japanese types” and “dark-skinned European types”. Other victims have claimed that racism fuelled the prosecutions, with one claiming that he was told by a staff member that “all Indians are doing it”.</p> <p>Atwal said: “Looking back, I feel like saying they were bullies, to be honest. I lost my job and everybody judges you. The Post Office was so strong – everybody feared them. I felt for my husband more than anything with all the staff, all the students, looking down on him.”</p> <p>The accounting system Atwal had been using in her branch in Coventry was a predecessor to the infamous Horizon IT software built by Fujitsu, whose faulty returns have led to the wrongful conviction of more than 900 people.</p> <p>However, internal documents seen by the Guardian suggest the Post Office had also been aware of “serious problems” with the earlier system, known as Capture, prompting a series of software upgrades.</p> <p>One advisory note about Capture that circulated in September 1995 advised that users could continue with the latest software upgrade but the problems encountered were more significant than they had initially understood and branches risked “data corruption problems”. A “large number” of offices were said to have been affected.</p> <p>Kevan Jones, the Labour MP who has been prominent in the campaign for the post office operators, said he had been contacted by a number of people who believed the pre-Horizon system led to paper shortfalls in their accounts and persecution.</p> <p>He said: “What makes me angry is that the Post Office knew all along about the problems with Horizon, and now they are not coming clean about the pre-Horizon system. The Capture system was full of bugs and errors.”</p> <p>A Post Office spokesperson said: “We take very seriously the concerns raised about cases from before the Horizon system was first rolled out in 1999. We are investigating, including specific cases brought to our attention.”</p> <p>Atwal was accused of stealing the money over a period from July 1995 until November 1996, when Post Office auditors made a morning visit to the branch.</p> <p>“It was not unusual but after a couple of hours they said this branch will be closed for the rest of the day so I started thinking, ‘What’s going on?’” Atwal, 73, recalled. “They kept asking me whether I had had any accounting problems and I said, ‘No’. There had been a couple of occasions where there had been discrepancies but that was a few years back.</p> <p>“They said, ‘We are short of £30,000, do you suspect anyone?’ I said, ‘I don’t, no.’ They said in that case you are responsible for it. One of the auditors commented to me as they were questioning me that ‘It is quite common in your society that women come under pressure to take money on the side, they don’t tell the family. Is someone putting pressure on you?’</p> <p>“He meant being an Asian woman that the culture is such that the rest of the family puts the pressure on the woman [leading to theft]. I said, ‘Don’t be silly’. I didn’t think much of the remark at the time but I was angry, to be honest.”</p> <p>Atwal, who had run the post office branch since 1989 without incident, said she was asked repeatedly whether anyone else in the family was involved in the business and whether she trusted her part-time staff. “They had been working with me for so many years so I did trust them,” she said. It was allegedly suggested by the auditors that if she admitted to being at fault that she may be able to avoid the harshest sanctions.</p> <p>Atwal was subsequently interviewed by Post Office investigators. “There was no support at all from the Post Office side, just accusation after accusation,” she said. “They kept on telling me to plead guilty, saying I would be treated leniently if I did. ‘You are otherwise definitely looking to a custodial sentence’, they said. I said, ‘I haven’t done anything, I won’t admit to it’”.</p> <p>Atwal appeared at Coventry crown court in August 1997. After three days of evidence, the judge said the Post Office had failed to provide any evidence of any shortfall in the accounts of agencies and clients. “They all said they had no complaints,” Atwal said. “But after the case the Post Office still wanted the money. I had no choice.”</p>",

Some of the world’s biggest miners, such as BHP and Glencore, will also be represented.</p> <p>The emergency meetings come after a year of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/20/australia-white-gold-ev-transition-battery-minerals-lithium-nickel-cobalt\">huge price declines</a> that has upended the battery minerals industry, while also threatening political ambitions to develop Australia into a mining and processing giant to help underpin the global electrification of the automotive sector.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Neil van Drunen, the acting chief executive of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (Amec), said battery minerals were the backbone of the global energy transition.</p> <p>“If we want to do downstream processing, we need to have operational mines,” Van Drunen said.</p> <p>“One of our big international comparative advantages is having the rocks here.”</p> <p>Amec is one of several resources groups that will ask for a deferment of royalties, which are payments miners make to the state government to extract the minerals, as well as a production tax credit designed to encourage processing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/20/australia-white-gold-ev-transition-battery-minerals-lithium-nickel-cobalt\">Australia’s ‘white gold’ was supposed to fuel the EV transition – then prices for battery minerals collapsed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is also a push for financial support for smaller resources companies that are facing collapse so that they can suspend operations and resurrect production at a later date rather than fold altogether.</p> <p>Since late 2022, lithium prices have fallen by more than 80%, while nickel is down by 40%, according to benchmark prices. Cobalt, another battery mineral, has shed 40% of its value.</p> <p>While EV battery demand continues to grow, vehicle sales have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/05/electric-car-sales-in-uk-flatline-prompting-calls-for-vat-cut\">lagged projections</a> amid pandemic and inflation disruptions, allowing mineral supplies to build up.</p> <p>As a result, miners in Australia with high production costs, operators with weaker balance sheets and resources companies that want to strategically wait for a price recovery have started suspending operations, leading to thousands of job losses.</p> <p>Independent Perth-based mining analyst Peter Strachan said state and federal governments should be cautious in using taxpayer dollars to bail out the sector as too many high-cost miners got caught up in the euphoria of anticipated demand.</p> <p>“When you look back, it was like tulip mania,” Strachan said, referring to the 17th-century Dutch economic bubble led by unsustainable demand for the brightly coloured flowers.</p> <p>“It would be throwing bad money after bad. Taxpayers shouldn’t be subsidising companies who’ve made mistakes or gone down blind alleys and try to dig them out.”</p> <p>Strachan said changing battery technology raised a cloud over demand forecasts for some minerals, with battery manufacturers adopting increasingly energy-dense and lower-cost materials that reduce the raw materials required.</p> <p>After holding on during the 12-month price collapse, many lithium and nickel mines are now taking drastic measures.</p> <p>Core Lithium announced at the start of January it would suspend operations at its project near Darwin, shortly before administrators at Panoramic Resources said they could no longer keep the Savannah nickel mine going in Western Australia.</p> <p>Canadian miner First Quantum told investors it would cease mining at the Ravensthorpe nickel and cobalt mine, also in WA, while Andrew Forrest’s Wyloo Metals is shutting its nickel operations.</p> <p>As the miners shut down, processing is curtailed.</p> <p>On Wednesday, lithium project operator Pilbara Minerals told shareholders it was unlikely to pay a half-year dividend because it wanted to protect its balance sheet.</p> <p>Ahead of the meetings, the federal resources minister, Madeleine King, said the prolonged impact the weak prices could have on Australia’s energy transition and local workforce was a matter of great concern.</p> <p>“Lithium and nickel are both crucial to the energy transition as we decarbonise. The mining of these resources supports many local jobs,” King said.</p> <p>“I am determined to ensure Australian miners can continue to compete with cheaper and lower-grade and high-carbon-intensity minerals produced elsewhere.”</p> <p>Some Australian miners have blamed the low mineral prices on increasing supply from China-backed projects in Indonesia, creating a potentially cheaper nickel jurisdiction than WA with less environmental controls.</p> <p>Adrienne LaBombard, the acting chief executive of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of WA, said Australian governments needed to deliver on promises to streamline regulatory approvals and provide the policy and fiscal certainty that would improve the country’s competitive position.</p> <p>“In the short term, targeted support for our lithium and nickel sectors, such as temporary royalty relief, should be considered and we are keen to work with government and move from discussion to action on a range of measures,” LaBombard said.</p>",

If the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/royal-mail-saturday-letter-service\">“will not countenance” scrapping postal deliveries on Saturdays</a>, then a five-day service is a non-starter and a three-day version is completely off limits for now.</p> <p>That, in theory – at least under this government – leaves only the surprise idea within Ofcom’s bundle: the one to slow down Royal Mail’s delivery speeds. It doesn’t have a simple name, but we could call it the “snail mail” proposal since it involves pushing the bulk of deliveries through a standard service taking “up to three days or longer”, as the regulator puts it. Urgent mail could still be delivered overnight, including for Saturdays, via a premium service that would operate outside the morning postal round – but you’d have to pay more than the current £1.25 cost of a first-class stamp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/royal-mail-services-may-be-about-to-change-how-do-other-countries-handle-postal-services\">Royal Mail services may be about to change: how do other countries handle postal services?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any good? Well, one can follow Ofcom’s thinking. The regulator starts from the position that “post users are willing to consider a slower letter service provided delivery is reliable”. One can also see the appeal for the government: it could say Saturday deliveries have been protected under a reliably slow standard model – it’s just that you’ll have to cough up if you really want an item to arrive the next day. An additional benefit for ministers, one might speculate, is that a vote in the Commons could be avoided. Unlike the five-day and three-day options, a “snail mail” reform to the current six-day-a-week Universal Service Obligation (USO) could happen just by Ofcom changing the regulations.</p> <p>The rest of us, though, should be deeply suspicious – and not only because of the potential lack of parliamentary scrutiny. For starters, three days “or longer” is as vague as it gets. Organisations that use the existing slow bulk service – think banks and utilities – may not notice a difference, but many small businesses would surely prefer a standard service that aims to be quicker. The Communication Workers Union is not alone in fearing we would end up with three-day-a-week deliveries by stealth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Royal Mail has an unmatched hyper-local network that ought to be capable of delivering other services to the door</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And how would a premium overnight service be priced? Weekly magazine publishers would be semi-obliged to go premium, but what would be the cost to them and their readers in terms of cover prices? The same applies to time-critical hospital appointment correspondence that can’t take a punt on three days or longer. The giveaway in Ofcom’s document was the enormously wide estimate of the net cost savings to Royal Mail under the slow-plus-premium model: £150m-£650m says details are sketchy and pricing is anybody’s guess.</p> <p>None of which is to deny that reform of some sort is needed. The volume of letters has fallen from 20bn to 7bn over the past 20 years and is predicted to shrink further. We are at a point where Royal Mail, even if it were managed superbly and banked every efficiency gain, would struggle to sustain the current universal service over the long-term. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/royal-mail-services-may-be-about-to-change-how-do-other-countries-handle-postal-services\">Many other European countries have already watered down their USO equivalents</a>. The question is which route the UK should take.</p> <p>This column’s vote still goes to the five-day-a-week option as the least bad compromise. It yields the smallest savings under Ofcom’s modelling, but £100m-£200m is not small change and Royal Mail, despite it all, is still targeting a return to adjusted operating profit in the financial year that ends in March 2025.</p> <p>The challenge for the company is to find new sources of revenues beyond letters and parcels. Royal Mail has an unmatched hyper-local network that ought to be capable of delivering other services to the door. Five days a week looks the minimum to encourage innovation while simultaneously maintaining the “social fabric” role of Royal Mail, which also matters, not least in rural areas. Three days, or three days by stealth via “snail mail”, would be giving up.</p>",

That would be accompanied by a next-day service for urgent letters, it said.</p> <p>The first option would require parliamentary approval, but the second change is within the regulator’s gift. Ofcom has conducted consumer research and modelled Royal Mail’s finances in the review, and will now seek views from interested parties until 3 April.</p> <p>In consumer polling for Ofcom, 88% of respondents said reliability<em> </em>was important for letter deliveries. This compared with 58% who said a Saturday service was important, down from 63% when research was last conducted in 2020.</p> <p>Royal Mail has long pushed to be allowed to cut Saturday deliveries, but the government rejected the proposal last year. It emerged last weekend that the move was being studied, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/royal-mail-saturday-letter-service\">Downing Street indicated it would oppose such a plan</a>. Rishi Sunak reiterated that stance on Wednesday, saying the government was “absolutely committed to ensuring that [the USO] remains as it is”.</p> <p>Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of Royal Mail’s parent company, International Distributions Services (IDS), said: “We have been calling on government and Ofcom to tackle this issue for four years, and the lack of action means that we are now facing a much more serious situation.</p> <p>“While other countries have grasped the opportunity to change, the UK is being left behind. There has been a lot of discussion about dropping Saturday letter deliveries in the UK, but as other countries have shown, there are a range of options to consider.”</p> <p>In a letter last week to the Commons business and trade committee chair, the Labour MP Liam Byrne, Seidenberg wrote that the USO was “unsustainable” in its current form, and cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/royal-mail-services-may-be-about-to-change-how-do-other-countries-handle-postal-services\">similar changes in other European countries</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Byrne said: “Let’s be absolutely clear: the USO is a vital public service, which is why we’ve called for government to get serious about talks with Royal Mail to agree a plan to secure its future.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/18/royal-mail-christmas-bonus-festive-deliveries\">Royal Mail hails best Christmas for four years – but staff miss £500 bonus </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: “We are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact on thousands of jobs.” </p> <p>Tina McKenzie, the policy and advocacy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “Trading essential services for short-term savings is a slippery slope that may compromise the trust small businesses place in Royal Mail.”</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney, said: “This feels like a slap in the face for so many who already have the pain of delayed deliveries.”</p> <p>It had been speculated that Ofcom could suggest state subsidies for Royal Mail, but that option was not contained in the review. The company was privatised in 2013, with the government’s final stake <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-completes-final-sale-of-its-stake-in-royal-mail-at-455p-per-share\">sold</a> in 2015. Shares in IDS rose by 4% on Wednesday morning after the review’s publication.</p> <p>Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of Ofcom, said: “We’re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels. The universal service hasn’t changed since then; it’s getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don’t take action.</p> <p>“So, we’ve set out options for reform so there can be a national discussion about the future of universal post. In the meantime, we’re making sure prices will remain affordable by capping the price of second-class stamps.”</p>",

After all, back in 2022 I was the guy who wrote: “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/sep/01/stage-3-tax-cuts-a-pile-of-garbage-and-everybody-knows-it\">The stage-three tax cuts are a pile of garbage, and everybody knows it</a>.”</p> \n<p>I distinctly remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/08/the-budget-in-seven-graphs-nice-for-now-but-horror-lies-ahead\">2018 budget lock-up</a> when the cuts first appeared. My jaw hit the floor when I realised the government was not only contemplating introducing a flat income tax, but was so brazen it hadn’t even provided any costings. </p> \n<p>When the costings finally arrived (some four years later), they were big. The latest estimate released by <a href=\"https://www.pbo.gov.au/publications-and-data/publications/costings/distributional-analysis-stage-3-tax-cuts-012024\">the Parliamentary Budget Office this week</a> estimated the cuts would cost $20.7bn in the first year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/24/stage-three-tax-cut-changes-endorsed-labor-albanese-government\">Labor MPs endorse changes to stage-three tax cuts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But things got really ugly when you looked at who would have received most of the stage-three tax cuts. More than half ($11.2bn) was going to people earning more than $150,000 a year. All up, just over three-quarters of the cuts would benefit the richest 20%.</p> \n<p>We were told the cuts would end bracket creep (they wouldn’t, given bracket creep affects low- and middle-income earners more than high-income earners). We were told the cuts would fire up productivity and participation (they wouldn’t, given the biggest tax cut was going to those on $200,000, and whose marginal tax rate of 45% wasn’t going to change at all).</p> \n<p>And now they are gone.</p> \n<p>Stage three is dead. Long live stage three new … better … improved … fairer?</p> \n<p>The details are yet to be officially announced and even since this column was first published different things have been confirmed to the media. I’ve updated some of the dollar figures and graphs a few hours after publication to reflect the new details as they’ve become public.</p> \n<p>Various media reports suggest the end result will be to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>reduce the lowest tax rate from 19% to 16%. The key aspect of this is unlike the stage-three tax cut, this means people earning less than $45,000 will get a tax cut of up to $804.</p></li> \n <li><p>reduce the 32.5% tax rate to 30% (this is the same as the old stage three).</p></li> \n <li><p>increase the 37% tax threshold from $120,000 to $135,000.</p></li> \n <li><p>increase the 45% tax threshold from $180,000 to $190,000 (the old stage would have increased this to $200,00).</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>So what does this look like? First, the dollar amount of tax cuts:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 1\"> <iframe title=\"The new stage three gives a bigger tax cut to 85 per cent of income earners\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-HVk2x\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HVk2x/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/HVk2x/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> \n<p>The median annual earnings for all Australian workers is now $67,600 – that is, half of our workers earn more and half earn less than that figure. This is the true “middle Australian worker”. They will be $804 better off under the new stage three than the old one – a $1,369 tax cut compared with $565.</p> \n<p>The PBO estimates that 90% of income earners earn less than $153,000. Given that the new stage three is better for those earning less than $146,500 you can pretty confidently say that 85% of income earners are better off under this new stage-three arrangement.</p> \n<p>That’s a pretty potent political weapon.</p> \n<p>But now let’s look at the cut as a percentage of income.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph 2\"> <iframe title=\"The new stage three tax cuts as a per cent of income \" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-adJCM\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/adJCM/6/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" data-external=\"1\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/adJCM/?v=3\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> \n<p>Those on the minimum wage of about $45,000, those on median earnings and even those on average full-time earnings of just under $100,000 all get much the same tax cut as do those on $200,000. The only bump is for those earning between $120,000 and $135,000 who get the benefit of the increased threshold.</p> \n<p>And when we look at the share of the benefits, the new stage three gives more to the bottom nine income deciles (the lowest 90%).

Meanwhile, it plans to outsource more jobs carried out by staff internally.</p> <p>Bird scrapped the Standard Life Aberdeen brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/26/standard-life-aberdeen-to-change-name-to-abrdn\">for its new name</a>, abrdn, two years ago in a move which was described as “ill-thought out”.</p> <p>The company said the bulk of overall savings will come from cutting a number of “non-staff costs”, which could include off-loading some of its properties, including office space and renegotiating contracts with suppliers. The cost-cutting programme is expected to take until the end of 2025.</p> <p>Details of the latest bonus pot will be revealed on 27 February when abrdn releases its annual results. The company paid out £85m in bonuses for 2022, though that was down from £126m a year earlier. The CEO’s bonus was slashed by 62.4% due to not hitting profit and flows targets.</p> <p>Affected abrdn staff, who are not unionised, are expected to be axed by the end of 2024.</p> <p>The overhaul follows a “root and branch review” of the Edinburgh-based company, which said that its cost-cutting programme would help shift resources and restore its investment business to “an acceptable level of profitability” over the next two years.</p> <p> The British asset manager suffered £12.4bn of net outflows in the second half of 2023, which the group partly blamed on high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty that had pushed clients to take safer bets.</p> <p>“Market conditions have remained challenging for our mix of business, and this is reflected in our year-end AUMA [assets under management and administration], flow numbers, and margins,” Bird said in a statement. “The board and I are committed to taking these significant cost actions now to restore our core investments business to a more acceptable level of profitability.”</p> <p>The share price initially dropped sharply, before recovering to rise by nearly 4% by midday today.</p>",

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.</p> <p>Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly smaller increase to 52.2.</p> <p>A jump in the services index to 53.8 offset a 47.3 figure for the manufacturing sector and a three-month drop to 44.9 for manufacturing output.</p> <p>A separate survey by the business lobby group the CBI showed on Wednesday that manufacturers were on the back foot going into 2024 with total new orders falling at their fastest pace since July 2020 after an index balance slumped from +2 in October to -13 in the three months to January.</p> <p>Shipping costs had fallen steeply from early December, according to the Baltic Dry index which tracks the cost of shipping bulk dry goods and is a leading economic indicator. However, that has risen sharply in recent weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/23/rishi-sunak-pressure-mps-commons-red-sea-yemen-airstrikes-houthis\">attacks by Houthi rebels</a> on container ships passing through the Red Sea.</p> <p>Export sales<strong> </strong>remained a weak spot, said Williamson, with a sustained decline in the manufacturing sector offsetting modest growth in the service economy.</p> <p>The S&amp;P survey found that falling inflation in the UK and a reduction in borrowing costs put services companies in a better mood and more willing to hire staff.</p> <p>The recovery in Britain’s services sector contrasts with weakness in the eurozone, where the composite PMI of 47.9 remained in negative territory in January and was fractionally below analysts’ forecasts.</p> <p>“The issue for the Bank of England is that inflation is also proving sticky, and the PMI highlights the disruption in the Red Sea,” said James Smith, economist at financial services firm ING. “Today’s data adds to the case for the Bank of England to wait a little longer before cutting rates.

The government has also granted permission for Drax <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/16/drax-gets-go-ahead-for-carbon-capture-project-at-estimated-40bn-cost-to-bill-payers\">to fit carbon capture technology</a> to biomass plant, in a project that could cost billpayers an estimated £40bn.</p> <p>The government’s biomass sustainability monitoring relies on a combination industry-backed data, third-party certifications and some assurance audit reports. The NAO has suggested the government should devote more resources to ensure that energy companies are being compliant.</p> <p>Matt Williams, an advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US-based environmental group, said the NAO’s findings suggest “billions of billpayer cash could have been used to cause environmental damage”, adding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/18/ministers-propose-extra-drax-subsidy-burn-trees-electricity-biomass\">extending Drax’s subsidies</a> in these circumstances was unjustifiable.</p> <p>Selaine Saxby, the Conservative MP for North Devon, said: “Since we first decided to subsidise energy generation from woody biomass, as part of the transition from coal, it has become clear that the science on the technology has changed.</p> <p>“Far more sustainable options have now been developed and improved, such as solar, wind and nuclear power generation, and I call on the government to support these technologies over biomass energy generation.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the government said its sustainability criteria was in line with internationally recognised standards, and it would be consulting later this year on how the UK could go further.</p>",

It will be among the largest blast furnaces in the world, with a 5,870 cubic metre capacity, and is due to be completed this year.</p> <p>Unions argue that building a new blast furnace while claiming an emissions cut in Wales represents double standards.</p> <p>The Indian site already houses a vast blast furnace, with a capacity of 4,330 cubic metres, which the company has lauded as the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=600400644&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;q=kalinganagar+tata&amp;tbm=vid&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwjNvVkvGDAxVgVUEAHSonC9EQ0pQJegQIDhAB&amp;biw=1648&amp;bih=1133&amp;dpr=2#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:c63aecd2,vid:bUm3xJZ-eTc,st:0\">“backbone of steelmaking”</a> at the plant.</p> <p>The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “Tata’s actions in India expose the myth that its plan to close the blast furnaces in Port Talbot is due to concerns about climate change. It is nothing of the sort. Tata is simply seeking to boost its global profits.</p> <p>“That’s why much-needed public investment in green steel should come with job guarantees and a plan for growth.”</p> <p>The Welsh job cuts have been more than a decade in the making, as Britain’s steel industry has struggled to compete with cheaper Chinese imports and European rivals with lower energy costs. Long-running negotiations over government subsidies eventually resulted in Tata announcing a £1.25bn investment, including £500m from the taxpayer, to switch to an electric arc furnace, which uses electricity to melt scrap metal rather than burning coal and iron ore. But that will be far less labour intensive, resulting in 2,500 jobs being cut at Port Talbot and another 300 at another south Wales site, in Llanwern. Semi-finished steel slabs will be imported from sites in India and the Netherlands before the EAF is operational in 2027.</p> <p>Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a GMB national officer, said: “This gross hypocrisy is exactly what GMB has been talking about – Tata’s plan is centred on importing steel from their plants in India and IJmuiden while the electric arc furnace is built – and beyond. </p> <p>“This transition being ‘green’ is a false flag, allowing foreign entities to profit off the back of GMB members and their communities.”</p> <p>India has been far less proactive than Europe in tackling company emissions and its steel industry is reliant on coal.</p> <p>Britain’s more stringent approach to tackling emissions, and the country’s abundance of scrap steel to feed EAFs, have set the two countries’ industries apart, sources said. The site has also been trialling carbon capture technology and the new blast furnace will have its own gas cleaning plant and a “robust dust extraction system”.</p> <p>Tata has expanded Kalinganagar – a new town built up in the face of local tribal resistance and taking advantage of iron ore reserves in Tomka – to become one of the most important assets in its global portfolio.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, a government agency began buying land from the public and courting international steel companies to open operations in coastal Odisha. The site, sandwiched between the crocodile-filled waters of the Bhitarkanika national park and the Tomka iron ore mountain, is one of four huge Tata steelworks in India (including its <a href=\"https://www.tatasteel.com/media/7155/jamshedpur-brochure_revised_final.pdf\">powerhouse Jamshedpur site</a>).</p> <p>Tata faced opposition from local villagers intent on receiving compensation and rehousing in return for their ancestral lands.</p> <p>The situation came to a head in January 2006, when police opened fire on a group of tribal people protesting against the construction of a boundary wall of the plant on land grazed by cattle, with 13 Adivasi people and a policeman killed. A memorial is held each year.</p> <p>A Tata Steel spokesperson said: “We understand how difficult this decision is for our workers and our steel communities ... We believe that scrap-based steelmaking is the right solution for our business in the UK – a country which is currently the second largest exporter of used steel in the world, and one in which renewable energy is developing quickly.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Conflicts in the Middle East have cost easyJet more than £40m as a result of flight suspensions and weakening demand, the airline has said.</p> <p>The company said that, while its year-on-year results had improved, the conflicts in Gaza and the Middle East had hit trading.</p> <p>In the days after the 7 October attacks in Israel, easyJet was one of a number of carriers that paused flights to Israel and nearby Jordan for safety reasons. These flights have yet to resume.</p> <p>The airline said the £40m loss was largely because of suspending these flights, with demand for trips to Egypt also affected since the conflict started. The routes make up about 4% of easyJet’s winter flight schedule.</p> <p>Johan Lundgren, its chief executive, said there were, however, clear signs of recovery in Egypt. “It was definitely impacted hard in the first six or seven weeks, but very quickly bounced back as well.”</p> <p>Lundgren said in November that the conflict would cause a “short-term industry-wide impact on [flight] searches and bookings”, similar to the effect at the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022. </p> <p>He said on Wednesday: “However horrific these events are from a humanitarian point of view, even if it’s relatively close to the network points, people will take a view – the underlying demand for travel is strong.”</p> <p>The airline reported a pre-tax loss of £126m in the final quarter of 2023, an improvement on the £133m loss during the same period last year. Airlines typically record seasonal winter losses as demand for holidays and flights drops. Group revenues at easyJet rose by 22% to £1.8bn.</p> <p>The group’s holiday booking arm, easyJet Holidays, which was launched in 2019, posted a profit of £30m for the final three months of 2023, up from £13m in the same period last year.</p> <p>The company predicted its first-half results would be up year on year despite the Middle East hit. It said the improved results came from “disciplined capacity growth” where demand was strongest and from productivity benefits.</p> <p>Lundgren said: “We see positive booking momentum for summer 2024 with travel remaining a priority for consumers.</p> <p>“Flight and holidays bookings took off strongly during the traditional busy turn of year sales period, as customers opted to secure their summer holidays to firm favourites like Spain and Portugal alongside destinations further afield like Greece and Turkey.”</p> <p>He said the airline had recorded increased booking volumes, equivalent to filling two planes a minute at peak period, and coming in at higher prices compared with the start of 2022. “Revenue per seat, a combination of load factor and the fares and then ancillaries, is well ahead versus the same period last year,” Lundgren said.</p> <p>Shares in easyJet rose about 4% in morning trading on the back of the upbeat outlook for bookings.</p> <p>The airline also announced an order for more than 300 engines from CFM to power the additional 157 Airbus aircraft it has bought.</p> <p>While easyJet has always used the Franco-American engine supplier, Lundgren said that with many other Airbus customers depending on troubled rival Pratt &amp; Whitney – and other airlines affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/boeing\">Boeing’s production woes</a> – “we are probably the only airline who is getting the deliveries that we set out to do, with 16 aircraft coming in this year”.</p>",

However, the cost will be far higher once inflation is taken into account, because EDF is using 2015 prices.</p> <p>The latest in a series of setbacks represents a huge delay to the project’s initial timescale. In 2007, the then EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said that by Christmas in 2017, turkeys would be cooked using electricity generated from atomic power at Hinkley. When the project was finally given the green light in 2016, its cost was estimated at £18bn.</p> <p>“Like other major infrastructure projects, we have found civil construction slower than we hoped and faced inflation, labour and material shortages, on top of Covid and Brexit disruption,” said Stuart Crooks, the project’s managing director, in a message to staff.</p> <p>Crooks said: “Running the project longer will cost more money and our budget has also been affected by rising civil construction costs. It is important to say that British consumers or taxpayers won’t pay a penny, with the increased costs met entirely by shareholders.”</p> <p>EDF had previously said that the first reactor unit at the nuclear site would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-station-edf-delayed-covid-costs-rise\">due to be complete by June 2027</a>, with a 15-month buffer period which was likely to be used – putting its completion at September 2028, and a further year for the second unit. It costs were estimated between £25bn and £26bn, and this was later revised up to £32.7bn in February 2023.</p> <p>EDF gave three scenarios, ranging from becoming operational is 2029, to delays pushing this back to 2031.</p> <p>It said that the cost of completing Hinkley will be between £31bn and £34bn, although if completion is delayed to 2031 costs would rise to £35bn.</p> <p>In December it emerged EDF’s partner in the project, China General Nuclear, had halted funding for Hinkley. The move came after the government took over CGN’s stake in Hinkley’s proposed sister site, Sizewell C in Suffolk, stripping the Chinese state-owned company of its role in the project.</p> <p>The latest financial estimates are based on accounting in 2015 figures, meaning the total cost of the project could be far higher when inflation over the last decade is factored in. Hinkley’s ballooning costs have proved controversial with French taxpayers, which are picking up the tab.</p> <p>Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C are expected to herald a new era of nuclear plants touted by the government.</p> <p>Last year the government launched a delivery body, Great British Nuclear, with the aim of accelerating the development of new nuclear projects. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/11/uk-government-sets-out-plans-for-biggest-nuclear-power-expansion-in-70-years\">Earlier this month ministers set out plans</a> for out for the “biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years”.</p> <p>However, the Hinkley Point C delay will add to concerns over project delays and costs, as well as skills in an industry earmarked to deliver a quarter of the national electricity demand by 2050.</p> <p>Crooks wrote: “Dome lift happened 24 months later than we had planned when we began in 2016. Of that delay, 15 months was due to the global pandemic. So, beyond Covid, we’ve lost nine months since we started. That’s not perfect, but for the first nuclear plant to be built in Britain since 1995, it’s not bad.”</p> <p>Crooks said that project was “well past the halfway mark” and “many risks are now behind us”.</p> <p>EDF said in January it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/09/edf-energy-uk-nuclear-power-plants\">delay the shutdown of four of its UK nuclear reactors</a> for at least two years and increase investment in its British nuclear fleet.</p>",

The US oil company is off to court in Texas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/us-oil-company-exxonmobil-investors-climate-follow-this\">to try to block a vote on a resolution tabled by Follow This</a>, a Dutch green activist investor group that would like Exxon to move faster (a lot faster) on reducing emissions.</p> <p>Exxon has an argument of sorts, one might say, in that Follow This tabled similar-sounding resolutions at the last two annual meetings and neither passed. Some 27.1% of shareholders aligned with the rebels in 2022 and 10.5% last year. Why go through the same process again, the company will argue. And, since last year’s meeting at Exxon contained 13 shareholder motions in total, haven’t US regulators allowed agendas to become overcrowded?</p> <p>Yet the company’s legalistic stance looks absurd in at least three ways. First, Follow This is not an obscure two-bob outfit: its resolution to be heard at Shell’s annual meeting this year<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/16/shell-faces-shareholder-rebellion-over-climate-activist-resolution\"> is being supported by 27 mainstream investment houses</a>, including Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. Whether Exxon likes it or not, the group represents a meaningful strand of climate opinion in the investment world. The grownup approach would surely be to make a counter-argument and let shareholders decide, just as Shell et al do. Anything else looks like a grubby attempt to avoid scrutiny.</p> <p>Second, the thrust of the Follow This motion merely calls on Exxon to do what most other members of the big oil club have already done and set some targets to reduce scope 3 emissions, meaning those generated by the consumption of its products. If Exxon’s board is determined to stand out by resisting such commitments, it would surely be in its own interests to seek annual validation from its owners.</p> <p>Third – and most obviously – Exxon could probably expect to win again. Yes, the company was humiliated in 2021 when a small hedge fund called Engine No 1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/26/exxonmobil-and-chevron-braced-for-showdown-over-climate\">managed to get three of its own candidates voted on to the board</a>, but rebellions (sadly) tend to succeed only when share prices are low, which is not the case at Exxon currently.</p> <p>Why is the company taking such a hard-headed approach? One suspects its real motive may be corporate America’s wider resentment of the growing number of shareholder resolutions being tabled these days. Exxon may see itself as striking a blow for a board’s right to manage without outside interference, especially on climate matters.</p> <p>That is the point at which Follow This’s struggle to be heard should concern all shareholders, whether they agree with the proposal at hand or not. Voting rights matter, and ought to be defended as a basic way to hold cocooned boards to account. The occasional real-world confrontation with the members of the awkward squad is a useful corrective. When the activist in this case could command 27% support – a minority, yes, but not a tiny one – as recently as two years ago, it ought to be seen as outrageous that Exxon thinks it can waft away dissent by running off to court.</p> <p>It would be a useful development if big fund managers rallied to Follow This’s defence. The right to table a climate proposal at an oil company is basic stuff.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Royal Mail is braced for the outcome of a five-month review by the communications industry regulator, Ofcom, on Wednesday. The watchdog is poised to lay out options for the future of deliveries, including the universal service obligation (USO) that mandates Royal Mail to deliver nationwide at a fixed price, six days a week.</p> <p>Pre-empting the review, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/22/royal-mail-saturday-letter-service\">a row has already broken out over an expected option to cut Saturday letter deliveries</a>. As recently as last year, Ofcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/uk-government-reject-royal-mail-request-end-saturday-deliveries\">rejected the idea</a>, which Royal Mail has pushed for. Industry sources claim a cut to a five-day service is the first step on a road to a three-day a week, or alternate day service, or potentially relaxing delivery targets.</p> <p>Last week, Martin Seidenberg, the chief executive of Royal Mail’s parent company, said the USO was “unsustainable” and highlighted shifts in postal services across Europe in a letter to MPs.</p> <p>However, some industry experts say comparing different countries’ services is difficult – with widely different populations, geographies, rates of letter volume decline and approaches to how customers are charged for distances of delivery and weight of packages. Here is how different countries are approaching their post.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>A potential government subsidy to run the USO could be included in Ofcom’s review, and Seidenberg cited support in France in his letter. “The French government has granted a subsidy of €2.6bn between 2021-2025 for La Poste,” he wrote. In return, standard letters are delivered within three days against a target of 95% on time. Last year, the <em>timbre rouge</em>, a red stamp guaranteeing next day delivery, was <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/wideangle-whats-happening-to-europes-postal-services/\">replaced by a fiddly digital equivalent</a>. A turquoise “services plus” now offers tracked delivery within two days, and <a href=\"https://www.lapostegroupe.com/en/news/la-poste-is-modernising-its-mail-service-range-to-meet-new-customer-needs-and-reduce-its-carbon-footprint\">compensation for late arrival</a>.</p> <h2>Denmark</h2> <p>The Scandinavian nation has been arguably the most bullish in Europe in paring back its postal service, driven in part by a desire to reduce paper waste. Standard deliveries were first taken down to just one delivery a week in 2016 and, as of this month, the requirement for a single firm to handle a universal service has been ditched. Instead, several operators now offer a set price for letters and parcels nationwide. Exceptions <a href=\"https://www.postnord.com/newsroom/2023/new-postal-law-results-in-changes-at-postnord-denmark\">have been made</a> for visually impaired people, those living on small islands and international mail.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>The Italian government has allowed its service to be reduced significantly, with the introduction of an alternate day delivery with a target of 80% arriving within one, two or three days depending on the region. A four-year, €1.3bn state subsidy for Poste Italiane reaches its final year this year. Meanwhile, Post Italiane’s 15-year remit to deliver to residents throughout Italy ends in 2026.</p> <p>The company, which began serving Italians in 1862, has argued that the “structural decline” in the letters market brought by digital communications continues, although the plunge seen during the pandemic has subsided. A <a href=\"https://www.posteitaliane.it/en/mail-parcel-and-distribution.html\">nascent project</a> to implement “smart letter boxes” – with a screen and a detector to sense if there is mail inside – is ongoing.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>Deutsche Post has the universal service mandate in Germany, meaning it delivers nationwide while its competitors can pick and choose where to deliver, albeit while paying a sales tax. A recent change to legislation, previously last updated in the 1990s, last year recommitted to a six-day-a-week letter service, but reduced the standard letter service from delivery within a day to three days. It also allowed a new next-day premium service to be introduced.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>The state owned Sociedad Estatal de Correos y Telégrafos, which started life in 1716, handles mail in Spain, and shares responsibilities for delivering to Andorra with France. Rates differ by region – for example, those on the Canary Islands pay more. In January 2020, Correos was awarded €1.28bn (£1.1bn) for delivering the universal service over the previous decade.

            "body" : "<p>Primark is holding the price of its clothing steady this spring, after price rises in 2023, as the retailer said consumer spending remains fragile and some of its costs were falling.</p> <p>The cut-price fashion chain said sales at established stores in the UK rose 3.8% in the 16 weeks to 6 January as prices rose by about 3% and more shoppers bought its slightly pricier The Edit and Rita Ora ranges.</p> <p>Globally Primark’s sales rose 7.3% to £3.4bn in the period, helped by store openings in the US and Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/23/squishmallows-uk-toy-sales-games-action-figures\">Squishmallows success fails to cushion impact of £200m drop in UK toy sales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The amount of clothing sold fell back as a warm autumn and tight household budgets put off shoppers – although Primark said sales picked up strongly just before Christmas when cold weather hit.</p> <p>“The pricing power of the consumer is still fragile,” said Eoin Tonge, the finance director of Primark’s parent group, Associated British Foods (ABF). “[The world] is not in a strong consumer place at the moment. [Outside the UK] it is even tougher.”</p> <p>Primark’s pace of growth slowed in the autumn but the store-only seller’s growth was another sign of the high street’s win over online clothing specialists at Christmas.</p> <p>While major retailers that can offer online orders and a vast network of stores – such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Next – did well over the festive period, those more reliant on web traffic or with weaker brands struggled.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the fast fashion website Boohoo said it had traded in line with expectations over Christmas – which were for a sales fall of up to 17% despite inflation – as it battles heavy competition from rapidly growing Chinese sellers such as Shein as well as a return to high street shopping, particularly among young people.</p> <p>Quiz, which makes almost a third of its sales online, also revealed that sales in December were down 11% on the same month a year before, which it said reflected the “negative impact of inflationary pressures on consumer demand which resulted in declines in traffic both in-store and online”.</p> <p>Tonge said Primark had gained its highest value UK market share to date as hard pressed shoppers turned to the cut-price chain. It was helped by a new online stock-checking service, click and collect on some products in 50-plus UK stores and sought-after lines such as the Rita Ora collection.</p> <p>“Our average selling price has been going up for about 12 months. We are out of that now and we don’t expect any more price increases. It is a question of whether we will start to see prices decreasing,” Tonge added.</p> <p>The cost of materials, such as cotton, and of manufacturing goods is coming down but staff costs are increasing. Tonge said wage rises would have greater impact than the additional cost of shipping driven by container ships having to travel around Africa because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/16/what-impact-have-uk-and-us-strikes-had-on-red-sea-shipping-disruption\">attacks on vessels off the coast of Yemen</a>, which are discouraging many from transiting the Red Sea.</p> <p>“This is not like Covid when all ports were having problems. This is one shipping [route] and most have just changed line. It is relatively adaptable,” Tonge said. He said the alternative route added two weeks to transit and would be more expensive. He thought this was “another reason that prices won’t come down soon” but added “we don’t think it is material and we will just have to absorb it”.</p> <p>ABF promised City analysts that Primark could stick to its plan to rebuild profit margins after last year’s drop, despite the freight issue, as analysts at Barclays said: “We doubt the impact would exceed £20m unless the situation in the Red Sea were to significantly worsen.”</p> <p>Tonge said there was still inflation on food but he expected prices to begin to fall by the end of 2024.</p> <p>“Commodities and energy have come down significantly and that was a big driver of inflation,” he added.</p> <p>While labour costs were still rising, he said: “The trend on food inflation will continue to come down and I think we will go into deflation.”</p>",

The airline has more of the affected planes than any other, and it forecasts that it will not be able to fly them again until at least February. In its annual earning report on Tuesday, United reported flat pre-tax profits of $3.4bn for 2023, but said it expected to lose money in the coming quarter.</p>",

Thames Water, which has its headquarters in Reading, said that subsequent pipe bursts then made it impossible to increase water pressure to homes, meaning some people have been without water for days. Emergency bottled water stations have been set up in the affected areas. On Monday, some schools and offices were forced to close as the low water pressure meant it was unsafe to stay open.</p> <p>Hundreds of homes in south London also reported having no water over the weekend after leaks across the network caused shortages.

Analysis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water\">Water</a> UK data from 2021 by the Angling Trust found that on average, water companies replace 0.05% of their water and wastewater pipe networks a year. Most European countries replace their water and wastewater pipes at about 0.5% a year.</p> <p>Alok Sharma, the MP for Reading West, apologised to his constituents and said he was in talks with senior managers of Thames Water. He said: “So sorry that constituents continue to experience problems with water supply. Have just spoken to a senior manager at Thames Water who says they are working hard to restore pressure.”</p> <p>Jason Brock, the leader of Reading borough council and Reading Labour, said the communication with residents had been poor. He told Reading Today: “Their support to, and communication with, residents has been unacceptably poor. Residents understandably feel that Thames Water simply don’t care about them.”</p> <p>Lib Dem environment spokesperson Tim Farron MP said: “This is a complete farce. Thames Water’s new CEO should write to every person affected with compensation and a grovelling apology. It begs the question just how bad a state is the infrastructure they get paid to maintain? It’s time they stopped spending millions of pounds on bonuses and dividends, and instead focused on the basics.”</p> <p>A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We’re really sorry to customers in the Reading, Pangbourne, Tilehurst and nearby areas who continue to experience low water pressure.</p> <p>“We have over nine tankers supplying water in the area to meet demand and improve water pressure. We also have over 50 engineers in the area fixing leaks and removing airlocks from our network. Teams are also repairing over 10 burst water mains, following the cold weather last week.</p> <p>“We expect water pressure to improve in the coming days as we carry out repairs and as reservoir levels increase, following a technical issue at Pangbourne water treatment works, which was resolved on Saturday.”</p> <p><br></p>",

The Farnham project has been delayed because of a series of planning, legal and construction problems.</p> <p>The company took a further charge of £11.3m for internal and external works on older buildings to rectify fire safety defects after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">devastating Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 caused by combustive cladding</a>.

However, we remain mindful of ongoing uncertainties within the broader economy.”</p> <p>He said hurdles in the planning system would leader to slower housebuilding volumes across the sector.</p> <p>Andy Murphy, an analyst at Edison Group, said: “The announcement of CEO Peter Truscott’s retirement and the appointment of Martyn Clark signals a crucial leadership transition.</p> <p>“Clark brings extensive industry experience, and his role becomes crucial in steering the company’s strategic recovery, controlling costs, and sustaining growth. Investors will closely watch how the leadership change contributes to Crest Nicholson’s efforts to overcome the recent operational and financial challenges.”</p> <p>Other housebuilders have also reported sharp declines in home completions. Persimmon built 9,922 homes last year, down by a third from the 14,868 in 2022. However, its fourth quarter was stronger as mortgage lenders cut their rates amid a fierce price war.

            "body" : "<p>Charles Randell had no idea what was about to unfold as he made his way to Downing Street in September 2007. Days earlier, the then chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/01/alistair-darling-lord-darling-obituary\">Alistair Darling</a> had taken drastic measures, guaranteeing deposits at Northern Rock in an effort to halt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/26/northernrock\">Britain’s first bank run in 140 years</a>.</p> <p>The future Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) chair – a partner at “magic circle” law firm Slaughter and May at the time – had followed the news closely, but admits: “I had no idea that this was the beginning of a huge snowball that would lead to a much bigger set of problems – and a very long-running assignment.”</p> <p>After a briefing with Treasury officials, who were familiar with Randell’s work on projects privatising the likes of British Gas, he was led down to No 11 Downing Street to meet his next client: Darling himself. “The whole thing is quite a blur,” Randell recalls.</p> <p>What ensued was a five-year appointment as the government’s chief legal adviser, as ministers spent £1tn to bail out and stabilise a banking system whose bosses were slow to recognise the severity of the crisis. Randell recalls being “stunned” weeks later, as he watched Northern Rock’s board discuss paying dividends just weeks after Darling’s intervention, eventually spurring him to push for government contingency plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/18/northernrock.banking3\">the bank’s eventual nationalisation</a>.</p> <p>A year later, he was in the room as disgraced Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was sacked by ministers, who had launched a bailout to save the lender from collapse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/banking-economy\">that eventually totalled £46bn</a>.</p> <p>“He was very surprised, and I think the [RBS] board was quite surprised,” Randell recalls. “I think this was another example of the fact that many people took a while to adjust the understanding of how bad things actually were.”</p> <p>It was a relentless role that sent Randell’s career in a very different direction tto what he had imagined. Born in 1958, he spent his formative years in postwar Germany, where his father worked as an intelligence officer for MI5. His family’s financial circumstances had been masked by subsidised military living, but the illusion was shattered when he was 12 years old and they returned to the UK during the economic doldrums of the 1970s. With no savings and only enough money to rent a small flat in Merton, south London, “it was quite a bleak comparison”, says Randell.</p> <p>While he eventually secured a place at Oxford University, financial worries pushed him to switch from English to law. His father’s sudden death from lung cancer left his mother with a meagre civil service widow’s pension, and a young Randell prioritising a supportive salary over his own educational&nbsp;passions.</p> <p>But a graduate position in 1980 would lead to “varied and interesting work” as Slaughter and May became the go-to law firm for privatisation projects that took companies such as British Telecom, British Aerospace and British Gas out of public hands. His reputation resulted in his financial-crisis-era role with the UK government, which was swiftly followed by a similar position advising the Portuguese government on its own crisis in&nbsp;2012.</p> <p>Randell eventually returned to the UK and in 2013 was convinced to join long-term efforts to reinforce the now tarnished financial system. He became a founding board member of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – one of two City regulators that replaced the disgraced Financial Services Authority in the wake of the crisis.</p> <p>There, he helped implement the first stress tests, meant to measure the financial strength of the banking sector, helping earn him a CBE for services to financial stability and climate change policy in 2016.</p> <p>By 2018, he was persuaded to chair the second arm of the City’s regulatory system, the FCA, alongside Andrew Bailey, now Bank of England governor.</p> <p>But the numerous issues plaguing the FCA – which was in desperate need of modernisation and was accused of failing to protect investors who had lost hundreds of millions of pounds though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/03/neil-woodford-investors-sue-administrators-of-collapsed-fund\">Neil Woodford</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/19/uk-taxpayers-face-120m-compensation-bill-for-lcf-scandal\">London Capital &amp; Finance</a> scandals – led to a demanding four years.</p> <p>While the FCA and PRA started with comparable workloads, the balance started to tip in 2014, when the former of the two bodies was put in charge of more than 30,000 consumer creditors, including derided payday&nbsp;lenders.</p> <p>“The workload of the FCA was doubled but the staff wasn’t and the budget wasn’t,” Randell says. Next came fears over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/14/funeral-plans-providers-safe-hands\">failed providers of funeral plans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/19/city-watchdog-fca-ex-chair-says-he-faced-political-pressure-to-let-in-crypto-firms\">concerns over the cryptocurrency boom</a>.</p> <p>“I probably look at the FCA as the most challenging job I’ve ever had. Many things were not fun … [but] there were other things that were hugely valuable to me,” Randell says, particularly connecting with real people affected by a financial sector often criticised for operating in its own City bubble.</p> <p>He recalls meeting a man struggling to pay off a loan shark linked to a paramilitary group in Belfast, pensioners in Solihull struggling to access increasingly digital banking services and workers in Blackpool struggling to manage finances on meagre benefits.</p> <p>They left such lasting impressions that Randell, who left the FCA after four years in 2022, was spurred on to join the Financial Inclusion Commission in November: a group of experts that sponsors research and lobbies for accessible financial services for vulnerable consumers.</p> <p>Its work is now set to influence Labour’s financial sector agenda, with Randell among 10 independent City grandees advising the party as it crafts fresh policies before the next general election.</p> <p>While Randell emphasises his lack of political leanings, his wealth of experience leaves him warning Labour to be prepared: “The key thing is to have a plan. Because once you get into power, events take over.”</p> <h2><strong>CV</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 65<br><strong>Family members: </strong>Wife Celia, three adult sons.<br><strong>Education:</strong> Bradfield College in Berkshire, an undergraduate degree in law at Trinity.

Borrowing in the first eight months of 2023-4 has been revised down by £4.2bn.</p> <p>Hunt could use any windfall to cut taxes, increase public spending or pay down debt – or a combination of all three – but the chancellor dropped a broad hint when he attended last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/18/jeremy-hunt-hints-at-voter-friendly-tax-giveaway-in-march-budget\">planning a package of tax cuts in his 6 March budget</a>. With opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives are on course for a landslide defeat, the budget is seen as one of the government’s last hopes of changing the political climate.</p> <p>Another indication of Hunt’s room for manoeuvre will be provided by the January borrowing figures, traditionally a bumper month for income-tax receipts before the self-assessment deadline. For January 2023 the ONS reported a surplus – where tax receipts are higher than spending – of £7.4bn.</p> <p>Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the analysts Capital Economics, said that after nine months of the 2023-24 fiscal year, borrowing was on track to undershoot the OBR’s full-year borrowing forecast of £123.9bn by £5bn.</p> <p>“What’s more, with market interest rate expectations and long-dated gilt yields having fallen since November, we suspect the OBR will revise down its borrowing forecast significantly from 2025-26,” she added.</p> <p>Hunt’s scope to cut taxes is constrained by his rule that debt should be falling as a share of national income in five years’ time, but Gregory said the latest data showed the chancellor would meet this target with about £20bn to spare. The ONS said debt was 97.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in December – an increase of almost two percentage points compared with a year earlier.</p> <p>Gregory said: “That will probably allow him to unveil a freeze in fuel duty in April 2024 (costing about £6bn a year) but perhaps also to announce more crowd-pleasing measures, such as a 1p cut to income tax (costing £6.9bn a year), while still maintaining fiscally prudent appearances.”</p> <p>Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “Protecting millions of lives and livelihoods during Putin’s energy shock and a once in a century pandemic has created economic challenges. However, it is right that we pay back these debts so future generations are not left to pick up the tab.</p> <p>“Because of this government’s decisive action, the economy is now beginning to turn a corner. Inflation has more than halved. Debt is on track to fall as a share of the economy. And we have been able to afford tax cuts for 27 million working people, and an £11bn tax cut to drive business investment.”</p> <p>Cara Pacitti, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Lower-than-expected inflation late last year has reduced debt interest costs and given the chancellor a timely fiscal boost ahead of his budget in March.</p> <p>“However, lower inflation is also likely to mean lower tax receipts. How these factors offset each other will be important in deciding how much fiscal headroom the chancellor has.”</p>",

Bumper sales of the smaller-sized versions, which cost about £9, helped the soft toy category defy the gloom to post growth of 11%.</p> <p>While less money was spent on toys for children, adults spent more on stuff for themselves, with “kidults” (buyers aged 12 and over) behind almost 30% of total UK toy sales in 2023. The kidult market was up 6%, spending £1bn on popular items such as Lego sets, soft toy collections and action figures.</p> <p>“Adults are seeking out escapism activities that tap into their childhood, evoking a more carefree time in their lives,” added Symonds. “This inclination towards toys that fulfil this need not only indulges their nostalgia but also positively contributes to their mental wellbeing.”</p> <p>Despite businesses coming under pressure from inflation, the average selling price of a toy increased by just 25p to £10.79. After several difficult years, Circana said the toy market is expected to stabilise in 2024 as consumer confidence is improving.</p> <p>“With people facing difficult times financially, these figures are not surprising,” said Kerri Atherton, the head of public affairs at the British Toy and Hobby Association, speaking as its annual toy fair got under way in London on Tuesday. The robust demand for plush toys, games and building sets pointed to the resilience of the UK toy market, she added.</p>",

I have been in the business for five years so half of that is gone. There is probably five to seven years that we can look at. We have to face into this inconvenient truth.”</p> <p>Mullen said the Mirror, which now sells about 230,000 copies daily, would be “pushing” 100,000 copy sales in five years at the current rate of decline.</p> <p>However, Mullen said that the cost-cutting drive to move to a digital-first approach to increase online revenues – which last year declined by £21m year on year to £127.8m – would stabilise the profitability of the titles.</p> <p>“At the moment print, the big brother, the big sister, is supporting the digital business,” he said. “At some point in the next five to seven years, which is where we have to think of, digital will get to a point where it will repay that debt and support the print business and keep those titles running. There is a future for our titles but the future is going to be different. The titles you are passionate about at some point get to a point where they will be of minimum use on paper but will [also] exist in other forms.”</p> <p>Mullen said the costs associated with running print plants and distribution remain high even as copy sales fall, exacerbated by print ad revenues falling in line with reduced circulation, and that readership was “under attack every day” from factors including the shift to digital and the life expectancy of its mid to late-50s average readership.</p> <p>“The big one we can’t avoid, that’s nature, we die,” he said. “So, we have tracked the mortality rate and the readers are basically dying over a period of time. Also you get to 75, that’s average mortality in the UK. This may sound really dry but it is important.”</p> <p>He also told staff who expressed concern that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/17/mirror-express-reach-national-local-newspaper-job-cuts\">deep cuts are making it increasingly difficult</a> to adequately cover the news comprehensively that it was a matter of “prioritisation”.</p> <p>“I think we have significant resources, even though we have cut them,” he said. “The question is, the argument is, we are spread too thinly. We need to accept the fact people are going to be asked to do more. We need to talk about prioritisation.”</p> <p>Mullen added that he had “never been involved in the editorial process” and how the cuts and “prioritisation” strategy is handled is up to editorial leadership.</p> <p>While he added that the deep cuts form part of a plan to ensure that this year will be free of redundancies, he could “not guarantee” there would be no more job losses if unexpected market shocks cause a faster than planned commercial deterioration.</p> <p>Mullen said the often-criticised overloading of webpages with ads and pop-ups is a fact of life as the business drives digital advertising to balance the decline in print.</p> <p>“The user experience is really straightforward, we are ad funded,” he said. “I am as disappointed as anyone else that people don’t really want to pay for our content online. Not enough of them, nowhere near enough of them. Some people struggle particularly on the websites but if we did not put those ad blocks in and did not get additional revenue in then those cuts would have to be deeper.”</p> <p>Asked about the strategy of flooding its websites with stories, Mullen indicated that reader engagement and the quality of articles did not drive revenues as much as volume of content.</p> <p>“We are in the real world,” he said. “I need to get the page views, that is the way we sell advertising blocks, and advertising blocks deliver revenue. I know it is not ideal. We don’t talk about engagement and quality. We do, but it is not in the trading report.”</p> <p>Reach declined to comment.</p>",

Exports from the UK’s second- and fourth-largest services-exporting cities – Greater Manchester and Birmingham – also grew, but at much slower rates of 11% and 3% respectively.</p> <p>Britain’s economy is becoming increasingly dominated by services, which account for about 80% of national output and 56% of exports. In the third quarter of 2023, exports of services stood at <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/november2023\">£119.9bn </a>while exports of goods were £94.3bn.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation said the concentration of services exports in London contrasted with France, where growth in Bordeaux and Lille had been faster than in Paris.</p> <p>The report said policymakers needed to understand services exports were far more broad-based than banking for Britain’s big cities to improve their performance. In London exports of information and communications technology were up 15% between 2016 and 2021, while exports of professional services grew by 12%. Banking exports were up by 8%.</p> <p>The thinktank said major cities outside London had the potential to sell more services overseas but they needed “vastly” more public investment in public transport and housing, and a major expansion of city centres to accommodate more firms and high-skilled workers.</p> <p>Emily Fry, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said services exports were one of Britain’s secret economic success stories. “Sadly, major cities outside London have failed to share in this growth, and the capital now accounts for almost half of all Britain’s services exports.</p> <p>“Britain needs to build up, rather than talk down, services as a route to future economic prosperity. Tradable services aren’t just about banking, and should not be something that just happens in the capital.</p> <p>“We have a wide range of strengths in services – from world class universities, to accountants and entertainment industries – and getting more of our major cities to sell this to the world would boost both local living standards and national economic growth.”</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Campaigners have spoken out against proposed changes to the law that would ease restrictions on marketing baby formula, arguing that they would not help cut prices for hard-pressed families but instead give free rein to powerful brands.</p> <p>The boss of Iceland, Richard Walker, has written to MPs proposing an amendment to the competition bill currently going through parliament that would remove the ban on advertising in stores, free samples, discount promotions and “any other promotional activity to induce the sale of an infant formula”.</p> <p>The prohibitions were introduced to avoid discouraging breastfeeding. Walker said that while breast milk “is always the best for babies” the regulations were “making it harder for families to access more affordable formula”.</p> <p>The competition watchdog is expected to make recommendations this summer on how to tackle profiteering in the baby formula market after an initial investigation last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/29/leading-grocery-brands-fuelling-greedflation-uk-regulator-finds\">found prices had risen 25% in two years</a>.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority found parents could save as much as £500 a year by switching brands but were reluctant to do so while competition was hampered because only one own-label alternative existed – from the cut-price chain Aldi.</p> <p>Families could also be buying more formula than required, the CMA said, as manufacturers’ feeding volume guides were “systematically higher” than those recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.</p> <p>Campaigners, including Walker, have called on the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/01/iceland-boss-hits-out-parent-exploitation-baby-milk-market\">to introduce measures such as a price cap </a>that would control profiteering on baby milks.</p> <p>Alison Thewliss MP, the head of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Infant Feeding, said Walker’s proposals would enable formula makers to spend more on marketing than they already did, adding to the costs and price of their products.</p> <p>Brands get around the limits on advertising infant formula by promoting “growing up” milk – a type of formula targeted at toddlers who do not need a special drink to remain healthy. She said Walker’s plan “played into the hands of formula companies and I don’t see how that cuts costs for people at the till. The UK government should be challenging companies directly on how much it is costing for product that for many is an absolute essential”.</p> <p>Dr Vicky Sibson, the director of the First Steps Nutrition Trust (FSNT), a baby health charity, said Walker’s proposals “would not make any difference for struggling families” and could lead to the sale of unnecessary products to those on low incomes.</p> <p>She added: “These laws on marketing formula are there to protect all babies no matter how they are fed. Weakening those laws runs the risk of affecting babies’ health.”</p> <p>Sibson said enabling the use of loyalty scheme points or vouchers for the purchase of formula would not help families on low incomes, who are most affected by high prices, as they would have to spend potentially thousands of pounds in order to get enough points for a tin.</p> <p>The FSNT is calling for a public health campaign to highlight that the content of all infant formula is strictly regulated, no matter the price or brand, so that they are nutritionally equivalent.</p> <p>Prof Amy Brown of Swansea University, who has researched the marketing of baby formula, said the most simple way to cut baby formula prices was for brands to reduce their profits.</p> <p>“They are making huge profits and that is what needs to change,” she said. “The rules [on marketing] are there for a reason and that is because they can’t play nicely. They use [free samples and discounts] to hook people in and persuade them to buy more expensive products.”</p>",

But given the importance of these deliveries, particularly to businesses, it’s not something we would countenance.”</p> <p>Ofcom has previously said cutting Saturdays could save Royal Mail £125m to £225m a year. Its proposals could also include changing first- and second-class delivery targets, higher stamp prices, a state subsidy for Royal Mail to provide the USO and even alternate day deliveries. However, the regulator does not have the authority to order any such changes, which would require an update to the Postal Services Act 2011.</p> <p>Royal Mail has long argued that delivering the six-day service in its current form is unsustainable, but last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/uk-government-reject-royal-mail-request-end-saturday-deliveries\">Ofcom rejected those calls</a> before later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/13/royal-mail-fined-56m-by-uk-regulator-for-missing-delivery-targets\">fining the company £5.6m</a> for missing delivery targets.</p> <p>The Observer revealed this month that the regulator was canvassing views on alternate day and three-day services, and a former employee said that Royal Mail’s push for a five-day service was a “red herring” before a more radical longer-term reduction in delivery days to cut costs.</p> <p>In a letter to MPs, the boss of Royal Mail’s parent company, Martin Seidenberg, said the USO was “simply not sustainable” and cited changes in other countries, including a move to alternate day deliveries in Germany and Italy.</p> <p>The Downing Street comments could cause problems for Labour if the party wins power at a general election this year as polls suggest.</p> <p>The party has yet to firmly assert its position on Saturday deliveries. Asked whether Labour would be content with an alternate day service, the shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, told Sky News: “No, I think it’s very worrying. There is a USO obligation, wherever you live in this country you should get a regular postal service – I think that’s still an important part of the infrastructure of our country and it’s very worrying to hear these proposals.”</p> <p>It is understood that Labour has been in talks with the Communication Workers Union (CWU) for 12 months and conversations are continuing over how to sustain the USO. Labour said last year it would conduct a regulatory review to improve quality of service and labour standards across the postal sector if it gained power, and opposed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/25/prospect-of-royal-mail-break-up-will-not-improve-workers-mood-on-eve-of-strike#:~:text=The%20split%20in%20question%20is,the%20group's%20financial%20update%20issued\">breakup of Royal Mail mooted during industrial action</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, the CWU said: “Ofcom have abandoned their responsibilities on quality of service and are now attempting to do the same on the USO.”</p> <p>The Labour backbencher and former Royal Mail employee Kate Osborne said: “Royal Mail is trying to strip away our much cherished postal service with no regard for the longer-term impact it will have on not only the workers and communities but also on businesses that rely on a six-day service.”</p> <p>Royal Mail reported its best Christmas in four years last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/18/royal-mail-christmas-bonus-festive-deliveries\">despite missing targets that would have triggered a £500 staff bonus</a>.</p>",

            "body" : "<p>Here it is, then, six years after the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/carillion\">Carillion</a>: the UK’s response to the massive governance failure at a major government contractor that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/carillion-fallout-deepens-as-workers-face-pay-being-stopped-in-48-hours\">folded only six months after its first profits warning</a>. From 2026 – so after yet more delay – the boards of quoted companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange will have to declare that their firms’ internal controls are up to scratch.</p> <p>If this rule change sounds like a watery imitation of what was promised in the aftermath of the Carillion fiasco, you’d be right. Back then, there was a zeal to take radical measures to reform the responsibilities of company directors, as well as to shake up the entire audit industry and the audit regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Instead, in terms of what will be required of directors, we’ve ended up with a tweak to the UK corporate governance code.</p> <p>Companies with a premium listing in London – the only ones to which the code formally applies – already have to carry out an annual review of the effectiveness of their financial, operational, reporting and compliance controls. The new obligation will merely make boards explain how they conducted the review and what it concluded.</p> <p>The change isn’t nothing, but the contrast with the US is stark. Over there, they have the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was introduced within a year of their own spectacular corporate blow-up – at the energy company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/30/corporatefraud.enron\">Enron in 2001</a>. US companies have to involve an external auditor in the review of their controls, which is a more intrusive process, and the act carries criminal sanctions. The UK version, even in tightened form, is less onerous by several degrees.</p> <p>The lowering of ambition has really been led by the government. Amid the general panic about the “competitiveness” of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/10/economic-growth-of-sorts-but-uk-plc-is-going-nowhere\">UK plc</a> and the declining status of the London Stock Exchange as a venue for company listings, anything that can be caricatured as bureaucratic red tape has been downgraded. The government’s mantra these days is to encourage risk-taking and growth. The FRC, in keeping rule changes “proportionate”, is merely following the script.</p> <p>That same script has already resulted in years of delays to the creation of the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga) as a muscular and statutory replacement for the FRC with powers to take enforcement action against all directors, not just – as at present – those who happen to be members of the accounting trade body. The failure to legislate for Arga is all part of the timid tone from Westminster. The corporate lobby has won most of the battles.</p> <p>An incidental benefit – let’s hope – is that we may see an end to whingeing from boardrooms about the supposedly impossible burdens placed on them by regulators and box-ticking investors. The plea never made much sense given the existence of Sarbanes-Oxley in the US. And it is even less persuasive now that the FRC has also dropped, more justifiably, earlier proposals to beef up reporting on environmental and social areas and the setting of diversity expectations.</p> <p>For good measure, Richard Moriarty, the chief executive of the FRC, has reminded companies that London’s “comply or explain” principle means what it says: cogent explanations for diverting from the code are allowed, and indeed are better than half-hearted compliance. That bit, at least, sounds like good sense. Company chairs are paid to make decisions and justify them. They should count their blessings: their lives have not been made impossible by regulations.</p>",
