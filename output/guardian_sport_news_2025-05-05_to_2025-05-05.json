No one has ever overturned so deep a deficit, but no one has ever been Mark J Williams – apart from Mark J Williams. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-681889108f088a65239d1f2c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-05-05T11:30:33.929Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There’s a simple reason we’re all here today: love. We love the snook, we love the Cruce, we love the cliches and we love all the little bits and pieces. How is it, say, that on every day of every tournament, the incomparably knowledgeable Crucible audience also comprises the most mirthful people in the world? Does Rob Walker go on like that all the time, even, er, to Mrs Walker? Will Hazel manage to make anyone cry in interview?</p> <p>So when someone threatens all of that – and much as we’d prefer not to – we’re well within our rights to feel a way about them. And that, I’m afraid, is the case with Zhao Xintong, poised to become China’s first world champion but also recently returned from a 20-month ban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/06/liang-wenbo-banned-for-life-after-investigation-into-snooker-match-fixing\">for his involvement in match-fixing</a>.</p> <p>On the face of things, it’s not easy to reconcile. If we consider how much we love snooker, imagine how much Zhao loves it – the love it takes to work hard enough to become one of the best players in the world, winner of a triple crown event at 24; to hone a flowing, thrilling, unique style suffused with joy; to see your life change for the better because of it. How could anyone risk all of that – while risking the essential integrity of our sport – for a few quid?</p> <p>To understand how what happened could happen, we need to take ourselves back to the pandemic. Zhao, like all but one of the accused, was living in Sheffield; he was young, a long way from home; and then lockdown happened. During this period, Liang Wenbo and Li Hang, now banned for life, used their influence as respected elders to prevail upon younger players – who were isolated, homesick and in some cases short of money – to fall in with their plan to make money through betting. They were all caught, and here we are.</p> <p>No one wants to be talking about this today. To watch Zhao play is to celebrate the game itself; he is its present and its future, armed with all the qualities he needs to share it with new people and places, while rejuvenating old ones. If he wins this final, that <em>will</em> happen.</p> <p>We could, of course, say he was old enough to know better and that he’s lucky to be back playing; we’d probably be right. But we could also look back to our own youth, consider all the stupid stuff we did, and through the complex but essential process of forgiving ourselves, grant others the same clemency. We can’t ignore what went on, but we can be sure Zhao will carry the shame and regret for as long as he’s around, decide that’s punishment enough, and be happy that he’s been offered another opportunity to glorify the thing that brought us all here to begin with. Because having considered how much he loved snooker before, can we even imagine how much he loves it now?</p> <p><strong>Start: 1pm BST</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

            "body" : "<p>The Crucible has been home to some of the most significant moments in snooker history. Minds will spring immediately to Dennis Taylor’s dramatic triumph in 1985, or one of Stephen Hendry or Ronnie O’Sullivan’s many victories on the grandest stage this sport has to offer.</p> <p>But 20 years on from the door for Chinese snooker being pushed ajar, Zhao Xintong may well have just changed the way the sport is viewed, played and followed for hundreds of millions of people in Asia and across the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/03/ronnie-osullivan-plans-new-life-in-middle-east-world-snooker-championship-semi-final-exit\">Ronnie O’Sullivan plans new life in Middle East after sorry semi-final exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was 2005 when Ding Junhui’s victory in the UK Championship against Steve Davis gave snooker hope it could be about to usher in a wave of success from China. There are more than 300,000 snooker halls in the country, where it is treated as a national sport. More 150 million were watching this match in China. This is seriously big business.</p> <p>But there was always one thing missing: a Chinese world champion. That wait is over thanks to one of the most exceptional talents the sport has seen beating Mark Williams 18-12 on Monday. It was 227 days ago when Zhao made his return in an empty snooker hall in Sofia on the amateur tour with a 3-0 victory over Lithuania’s Vilius Schulte-Ebbert.</p> <p>Zhao was returning from a 20-month suspension for his part <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/18/ten-suspended-chinese-snooker-players-charged-with-match-fixing-by-wpbsa\">in the match-fixing scandal</a> that threatened to grind Chinese snooker to a halt. It is important to point out that while 10 players were suspended for varying lengths of time, Zhao did not directly throw a match.</p> <p>He did accept charges of being a party to another player fixing two games and betting on matches himself, but showed remorse in admitting guilt in China and the UK, where he now resides. The reception from the Crucible crowd suggests that while doubters will remain, many are willing to give him a second chance.</p> <p>“It’s very good for Chinese snooker,” Zhao said. “I’m very happy I’ve done this for them. It’s unbelievable. This is like a dream. When I shook hands with Mark [Williams] I nearly cried. My first target was just to get through the qualifiers. In the future, many Chinese players can win this.”</p> <p>Williams was gracious enough to admit this moment could supersede what any victory may have meant for him. “Everyone’s got to get behind him and watch him – he could dominate,” he said. “It’s bound to open some doors. It can only be good for our sport.”</p>    <p>Organisers were adamant Zhao, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/05/chinas-zhao-xintong-beats-luca-brecel-to-claim-uk-snooker-championship\">won the UK Championship in 2021</a> before his suspension, had to start at the bottom. He was consigned to the Q Tour for amateurs but he made a mockery of that level, proving near unbeatable.</p> <p>Zhao has won an incredible 42 of his first 44 games since returning, including five to qualify for this world championship. He was quietly fancied by some given his undeniable ability and his sensational temperament, but few could have imagined the manner in how he would handle the biggest occasion.</p> <p>He performed with such effortless swagger throughout large periods of the final, against one of the greatest players of all time. Zhao emphatically won both afternoon sessions to move to within one frame of the title at the start of the final session but Williams was never going to go away quietly.</p> <p>At 50, he is the oldest finalist in Crucible history and after winning four consecutive frames on Monday evening, a 17-8 deficit was reduced to 17-12 in a matter of minutes. But once Zhao was given one half-chance, he would not pass up on the opportunity, such has been his unflappable nature throughout the tournament.</p> <p>That proved to be the case . A break of 87 executed with the fluency that has taken him through the nine matches in qualifying and the main draw proved to be more than enough, with Zhao raising a Chinese flag aloft during the celebrations to perhaps symbolically usher in a new era for the sport.</p> <p>The new champion did not have far to go with his trophy and £500,000 winner’s cheque: he lives just a 10-minute walk from the Crucible. But it is thousands of miles away where this triumph will truly be felt.</p> <p>“He’s bashed me up, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/02/zhao-xintong-ronnie-o-sullivan-judd-trump-mark-williams-world-snooker-championship-semi-finals\">bashed Ronnie [O’Sullivan] up</a> and bashed everyone up,” Williams said. “There’s a new superstar of the game. I’m glad I’ll be too old when he’s dominating.” Perhaps that dominance has already begun.</p>",

First, at Taunton, where James Rew hauled <strong>Somerset</strong> to a victory pulled from the ditch of defeat against <strong>Essex</strong>. </p> <p>Rew’s uncanny calm belies his years and, at 21, he became the youngest player to make 10 first-class centuries since Denis Compton. Out just before the close for 116, the winning runs were thumped by Craig Overton, a straight six off Simon Harmer for a first victory of the season.</p> <p>A six also won the game at Lord’s where, with just one over and two wickets left, Zafar Gohar dropped to one knee and took aim at the Grand Stand. <strong>Middlesex</strong>’s smash and grab had come courtesy of a maiden first-class century from Luke Hollman, a brave innings from Stephen Eskinazi, who retired with a back spasm but hobbled back on again for the greater cause, 59 from Jack Davies, and a ninth-wicket stand between Toby Roland-Jones and Gohar. <strong>Kent</strong>’s Matt Parkinson bowled beautifully for his three wickets.</p> <p>A draw at Sophia Gardens was much more than the sum of its parts, eight <strong>Glamorgan</strong> fielders crowding <strong>Derbyshire</strong>’s Luis Reece for the final over with one wicket needed, after a brave declaration from Sam Northeast. Ben Kellaway pocketed both career-best batting and bowling figures.</p> <p><strong>Gloucestershire</strong> nearly pulled off a great heist after declaring overnight at Old Trafford. They reduced <strong>Lancashire</strong> to 160 for six, only for Luke Wells and Tom Hartley to bat the game to a draw. Only the draw at <strong>Durham</strong> and <strong>Hampshire</strong> bucked the trend, on a pancake pitch at Southampton where only 20 wickets fell in four days. Durham’s head coach, Ryan Campbell, said: “It is one of those games where you look back on and think: ‘What is the point?’ Until we start to get wickets right in this competition it is pretty disappointing.</p> <p>“First away game we had a 30-yard boundary and then we had a snake pit, and then you come here and they have already played two games on a wicket.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6818f9fd8f088a65239d24a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2025-05-05T17:51:38.524Z\">6.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thrill, spills and heartaches. </strong>Thanks for your company, it’s been fun.

Doris sustained the injury during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/03/leinster-northampton-european-rugby-champions-cup-semi-final-match-report\">Leinster’s Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northampton</a> on Saturday and was replaced during the second half. Leinster do not expect Doris to play again this season and said in a statement the ­precise length of any layoff would not be known until after the operation. Nienaber’s “gut” instinct painted a bleak outlook for the No 8, however.</p> <p>“He saw a specialist and I think there’s some further investigation that needs to be done,” Nienaber said. “Fingers crossed that things aren’t as bad as we think it is, but in the last couple of months that I’ve worked with Caelan, he’s not a guy that necessarily comes off the pitch with injury.</p> <p>“So when I subjectively saw him coming off the pitch on Saturday, I thought in my mind: ‘That must be quite serious’. We’ll probably know more in the back end of the week, but my gut, and it’s only gut, says that I think it might be serious. But fingers crossed it might not be.</p>    <p>“It’ll definitely be a race. Shoulder injuries, depending on the amount of structural damage there is, can be anything from a two-month thing to a four-to-six month thing. We know there is damage, we’re just not 100% sure how much damage.”</p> <p>Farrell is due to announce his captain and unveil his squad in front of a live audience at the O2 on Thursday and it is expected that Doris will have undergone the operation before then.</p> <p>The potential to lose Doris so soon before his squad announcement is a major concern for Farrell. Even if he was already leaning towards Itoje – who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/15/unflappable-maro-itoje-proves-he-now-deserves-lions-captaincy\">excelled as England’s leader in the Six Nations</a> – Doris is his Ireland skipper and was almost certainly nailed on to start the Test series against the Wallabies at No 8.</p> <p>Farrell will now anxiously await the result of Doris’s operation, all the while exploring contingency options. Last month the head coach insisted there were at least a handful of options for the captaincy – Sione Tuipulotu, Jamie George and even Owen Farrell could fit the bill – but Itoje has excelled since assuming the role for club and country this season. And while the back-row positions in the squad will be hotly contested, there are fewer standout candidates at No8.</p>    <p>If Doris is ruled out, it could open the door for Taulupe Faletau to go on a fourth Lions tour, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/03/northampton-hope-shock-win-over-leinster-is-platform-for-more-success\">it could also help Henry Pollock’s cause</a>. Scotland’s Matt Fagerson and Jack Dempsey are other options, having both appeared at No 8 during the Six Nations, as well as England’s Ben Earl and Tom Willis. Jack Conan deputises for Doris for Leinster and Ireland.</p> <p>The Lions play their first match – a warmup fixture against Argentina – in Dublin on 20 June before beginning their tour of Australia against Western Force in Perth eight days later. The first Test against the Wallabies is on 19 July, raising the possibility that Doris could end up joining the squad after the tour has started. Four years ago, Alun Wyn Jones suffered a dislocated shoulder in the warmup match against Japan and was initially ruled out of the tour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/14/alun-wyn-jones-to-rejoin-lions-squad-for-tests-after-recovering-from-injury-rugby#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20delighted%20to%20welcome,he%20left%20us%20in%20Edinburgh.\">only to join the squad in South Africa 18 days later</a>.</p> <p>In 2017, Warren Gatland named Sam Warburton as captain for the second consecutive tour shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/11/sam-warburton-lions-doubt-knee-injury-six-weeks-rugby-union\">the Wales flanker had sustained a knee injury</a>. He battled back to fitness to appear in the Lions’ first tour match against the New Zealand Provincial Barbarians but sustained an ankle injury in that fixture.

            "body" : "<p>The German racing driver Jochen Mass, who has died aged 78, won only one of the 104 grands prix in which he competed between 1974 and 1982, but he was known as a talented and reliable competitor, a useful number two to such champions as Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt, as well as being a winner of many endurance races in sports cars, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p> <p>His sole victory in a world championship Formula 1 race came in tragic circumstances. In 1975, after joining the McLaren team for his second season in the top tier, he had taken the lead of the Spanish Grand Prix on the fast and spectacular Montjuïc Park circuit in Barcelona when the race was halted after an accident. </p> <p>Before the race, the drivers, led by Fittipaldi, the reigning champion and Mass’s teammate, had pointed out to the organisers that the steel safety barriers surrounding the track had been poorly assembled. Their protest meetings held up the practice sessions, and it was only after hasty remedial work that the meeting could continue. The race itself took place without Fittipaldi, who had flown home in disgust. </p> <p>There had already been several accidents when another German driver, Rolf Stommelen, found himself in an unexpected lead at the wheel of a brand-new car built and entered by the team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/dec/02/from-the-vault-graham-hill-formula-one\">Graham Hill</a>. As he started the 26th lap, a rear-wing stay broke as the car approached the brow of a hill at 150mph, sending it smashing into the barriers and then flying over them. Stommelen survived but two photographers, a track marshal and a spectator were killed.</p>    <p>It took three more laps for the race to be stopped, by which time Mass had taken the lead from Jacky Ickx’s Lotus, and he was declared the winner. But since only 29 of the scheduled 75 laps had been completed, he was awarded only half the customary nine points for a victory. Added to other minor placings during the season, those points helped him to seventh place in the final drivers’ championship table, the highest he would ever achieve.</p> <p> “I took no pleasure in my first F1 victory, believing I’d win many more later,” he remembered. Although that was not to happen, he went on to a distinguished career and after his retirement became a much-loved figure in the paddock and on the track at historic meetings, particularly the Goodwood Revival, to which he travelled from his home in the south of France.</p> <p>Mass was born in the aftermath of the second world war in Dorfen, near Munich, and remembered driving his pedal car through streets still strewn with rubble. After his father died when he was nine, he followed the example of his grandfather, who had been a sailor, and joined the merchant navy, where he spent several years. It was a passion that would stay with him throughout his life; during breaks from the grand prix season he would sail his old schooner across the Atlantic.</p>    <p>His first experience of motor sport came in hill-climbs, where he performed so impressively in an Alfa Romeo saloon in 1970 that Ford Cologne offered him a contract. Soon he was racing the powerful works-prepared Capris, winning the important European touring car series in 1972. </p> <p>The move into single-seaters came that year with his first races in Formula 3 and then his first Formula 2 victory in a works March at the Nürburgring, a circuit of 14 miles and 174 corners whose challenge he loved. For 1973 he raced for the works Surtees team in Formula 2 before graduating to Formula 1 with the same team for 1974, enduring a debut season in the top flight blighted by many retirements.</p> <p>But he had shown enough of his talent to be signed by McLaren for 1974, and there he stayed for three seasons, alongside Hunt during the dramatic 1976 season as the Englishman seized the world title from Lauda. He was leading the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring when the race was halted following Niki Lauda’s near-fatal crash, finishing third after the restart. A second place in Sweden in 1977 was the closest he came to another victory.</p> <p>A move to the ATS team followed in 1978, but the car was poor and his season ended prematurely when he broke a leg in a testing accident. Signing with Arrows in 1979 proved little more satisfactory, although there was a fourth place at Monaco in his second season with the Milton Keynes-based team, having avoided a four-car pile-up at the first corner. </p> <p>His final year in F1, with the ailing March team, was an unhappy one. Travelling slowly during practice at Zolder, he was trying to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/mar/21/joann-villeneuve-gilles-was-ruthless-but-very-conscious-of-the-dangers\">Gilles Villeneuve</a> room to pass when the French-Canadian’s Ferrari hit his March and somersaulted. Villeneuve’s death in the disintegrating wreckage came as a profound shock to the F1 world, although Mass was absolved of blame. </p> <p>And then, at the Paul Ricard circuit in Provence, he collided with Mauro Baldi’s Arrows and flew into a public area, leaving several spectators injured. As the car caught fire, few observers – including Mass’s wife, watching on TV – believed he could survive, never mind walk away unharmed, as he did. </p> <p>That was when he decided to retire from grand prix racing and concentrate on sports cars – first with Porsche, with whom he and Vern Schuppan finished second at Le Mans in 1982, and then with Sauber-Mercedes, winning the race with Stanley Dickens and Manuel Reuter in 1989 and being deprived of a second victory in 1991 after leading comfortably for 17 hours before a minor component failed. </p> <p>That period also saw him acting as a mentor to Mercedes’ junior team of three talented young drivers serving their apprenticeship in sports cars: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-schumacher\">Michael Schumacher</a>, with whom Mass shared the winning car in Mexico City, Karl Wendlinger, with whom he won at Spa, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen. All three followed him into F1.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Bettina, whom he married in 1994, and their two daughters, and by his two sons from a first marriage, to Esti (nee Mellet), which ended in divorce.</p> <p><em> </em><em> • </em>Jochen Richard Mass, racing driver, born 30 September 1946; died 4 May 2025</p>",

For me, what’s missing is the complete feedback of where my level is. That’s going to come slowly with time playing. After the first-round match I’m going to have a good ­picture of myself, where I am at.</p> <p>“Talking about the other stuff, with&nbsp;players, I just arrived 45 ­minutes ago. I haven’t seen so many. I was down talking with some players. It’s all fine at the moment [but] I haven’t seen most of them.

After taking some time off at the beginning of his ban, for Sinner this meant that he was limited in what he was capable of doing. “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/30/jannik-sinner-considered-quitting-tennis-during-fallout-doping-case-tennis\">For me, last year was very difficult</a>,” said Sinner. “I had a lot of personal pressure, ­holding everything [in] and couldn’t talk with many people about what happened. I was in a tough situation, and in the beginning of the ­Australian Open, I struggled a lot. So it was nice also to take a small break. Three months is a little bit [too much], it is what it is.</p> <p>“But a small break was good, but I could feel that I’m not playing for quite a long time. </p>    <p>“The body still has to adjust at times. The blisters and hands, they come again because you know you’re not used to it any more. I’m just very happy and very curious to see where I am at. And now we’ll see.”</p> <p>In addition to being banned from his own sport, the anti-doping rules also bar suspended athletes from entering sanctioned sporting ­arenas. According to Sinner, who is an ambassador for Formula One and an avid sports fan, the hardest aspect of the ban was ­actually not being able to attend any other ­professional sporting events.</p> <p>“To be honest, for me, the toughest part was that, in the beginning, I couldn’t watch any other sport, really, in real life,” he said. “I don’t know how many [people] know this, but, for example, watching a simple football match in a stadium, I couldn’t go there to watch it. I wanted to support my friends in cycling or motor sport, I couldn’t go there. That, for me, was the toughest part. But all things considered, I tried to make the best out of it, being ready mentally from the point when I started again to play ­tennis and that’s it. No, it’s all fine. And I was very glad to also spend some time with my family.”</p> <p>Sinner has become one of the most prominent and successful Italian ­athletes of his era, meaning his return to competition in his home country has naturally generated significant news and attention. His press ­conference was completely filled with journalists and a number of attendees applauded when the tennis player entered the room. Sinner’s romantic relationships have also been the subject of discussion in recent weeks, which prompted him to humorously address those rumours in his opening statement. </p> <p>“There’s a whole a lot of attention, also kind of off the court. And I was also very surprised to see some pictures, which are nothing serious. So yeah, I’m not in a relationship. So whoever is asking, it’s all good,” he said, smiling.</p> <p>A few hours later, Sinner entered Campo Centrale to thunderous applause for his first practice session at an official tournament in three months. His practice points with Jiri Lehecka, the 23-year-old Czech, was soundtracked by a constant stream of cheers from his home crowd. Sinner remains the ATP No 1 and as with all seeded players at the Italian Open, he has received a first-round bye. He will mark his return to professional tennis in round two against either Mariano Navone or Federico Cina. </p>",

Up to 10 six-race fixtures will be staged annually at some of the sport’s most famous tracks around the world.</p> \n<p>According to various reports, the “revolutionary” new competition will, its organisers claim, have “a franchise-based league structure” designed to turn riders into “global icons” and engage a “fresh audience” for racing. The jockeys involved will own equity in their team, act as the “team principal” for their franchise and, if all goes to plan, will be competing for a share of a $15m prize fund within two years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/may/04/horse-racing-updates-1000-guineas-and-more-live\">Desert Flower wins 1,000 Guineas to seal Classic weekend double for Appleby – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Beyond the names of the riders involved – which also include James McDonald, Flavien Prat, Irad Ortiz Jr, Vincent Ho, Mickaël Barzalona and Christophe Lemaire – there is not much clarity on important information such as dates, venues or how the competition will be structured given that the riders are not racing’s primary athletes. For now, the aim seems to be to secure commercial backing and sponsorship for the project and the individual riders’ teams.</p> \n<p>Innovation, new money and, hopefully, a fresh generation of enthusiasts for a sport with an ageing fanbase is, on the face of it, an enticing prospect. The project’s co-founders, John Ferguson and Lachlan Fitt, have a wide range of experience in the industry. Ferguson is a former chief executive of the Godolphin operation and current board member of the British Horseracing Authority, while Fitt recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/20/third-executive-quits-gambling-giant-as-company-battles-ongoing-money-laundering-case-ntwnfb\">resigned from his role</a> as deputy CEO of gambling group Entain’s Australian arm.</p> \n<p>While there are undoubtedly some very talented names on the cast-list of riders, the sport is called horse racing for a reason. This has been a source of frustration for the promoters for decades – how do you persuade people to engage with athletes when the athletes can’t talk? – and trying to persuade them to engage with the jockeys instead is not exactly new.</p> \n<p>The Shergar Cup, a jockey-based team event at Ascot in August, has been around for a quarter of a century, while the International Jockeys’ Championship has long been a popular feature of Hong Kong’s annual International event in December.</p> \n<p>But these events are, essentially, just a bit of fun before the serious stuff with the best horses gets under way. To be anything more than that, or provide a meaningful comparison between the abilities of the riders involved, the new league would need to account for the varying chances of the horses taking part without making it all too complex for its audience to understand.</p> \n<p>A jockey’s role, after all, is to maximise a horse’s chance by getting it from start to finish as swiftly and efficiently as possible. If an odds-on shot scrambles home from a 25-1 outsider, the rider of the runner-up may well have done their job much better than the one on the winner, but no jockey will ever be able to make a horse run any faster than its genes, physique and preparation will allow.</p> \n<p>This is not to suggest that there is anything wrong with a bit of fun and while the flag-waving at the Shergar Cup may not be to everyone’s taste it was Ascot’s second-biggest draw outside the Royal meeting last year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9fa4e3d2-a7f4-447a-aba2-952ec2882bac\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Fakenham </b>2.15 Collingham 2.45 Miss Fedora 3.15 Back In The Bay 3.45 Lenjoleur De Palma 4.15 Glynn 4.50 Fever Dream</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Ffos Las </b>2.30 Herja 3.00 Tropical Speed 3.30 Baseline 4.00 Getuptheyard 4.30 Princess Keri 5.00 Gavin</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Worcester </b>5.48 Tropical Talent 6.18 Pottlerath 6.48 Ebony Warrior 7.18 Campaign Trail 7.48 Plus Point 8.18 Indemnity</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Wolverhampton </b>6.30 Lednikov 7.00 Callisto Dream 7.30 Yellow Card (nb) 8.00 Take The Boat (nap) 8.30 Miss Dandylion 9.00 Cooramook</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With its talk of a $15m prize fund, though, and a claim by Fitt that “the concept we’ve developed with our foundation jockeys can help revolutionise global horseracing in the coming years”, the global jockeys’ league seems to be aiming to be rather more than a sideshow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"57c5f7d2-b905-49b3-9279-918948ee3d36\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Chester:&nbsp;</b>1.30 Ali Shuffle 2.05 Kinetic Force 2.35 That’s Amore 3.05 Lambourn 3.40 Bob Mali (nap) 4.10 Sea Suite 4.45 Farasi Lane.</p>\n    <p><b>Newton Abbot:&nbsp;</b>1.45 Light N Strike 2.15 Roxanne 2.45 Gwennie May Jem 3.15 Clear Storm 3.50 A Definite Getaway 4.20 Supreme Yeats.</p>\n    <p><b>Kelso:&nbsp;</b>2.25 Wee Alki 2.55 Just Oot 3.25 Cage Rattler 4.00 Magic Wave 4.35 Milajess 5.05 Luckie Devil.</p>\n    <p><b>Fontwell:&nbsp;</b>5.35 Summer In Milan 6.10 Easy Love 6.40 Jack Sparrow Grey 7.10 Bobalot 7.40 Sir Rock 8.10 Newmill Getaway.</p>\n    <p><b>Kempton:&nbsp;</b>5.28 Port Road 6.00 Lalique 6.30 Bee My Honey 7.00 Miss Chester 7.30 Study Up (nb) 8.00 Abbey Heights 8.30 Cheeky Stanley 9.00 Nobleman.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is precious little detail available as yet and there may be a cunning plan to make the league a meaningful contest between jockeys from very different racing backgrounds.

The 25-year-old came back strongly passing Verstappen, with the McLaren clearly having an enormous pace advantage over the Red Bull, to claim second place behind his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who took a dominant win from fourth on the grid. Both McLarens ultimately finished more than 30 seconds in front of the third-placed Mercedes of George Russell, with Verstappen in fourth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/05/lewis-hamilton-ferrari-team-radio-miami-grand-prix-formula-one\">Lewis Hamilton unapologetic for terse exchange with Ferrari at Miami Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, admitted with hindsight that Norris might have backed off and bided his time to ease past Verstappen but it was far from clear in the opening corner of the first lap that the McLaren would end up with such an advantage. </p> <p>“I quite like to see Lando aggressive, going for taking the lead of the race and sometimes it’s just the matter of a fraction of a second,” Stella said. “In this case Lando could have been a little bit more patient. With the benefit of hindsight it could have been better for Lando to just lift and make sure that he could keep the second position because the car was very fast and he would certainly have passed Max.”</p> <p>The incident with Verstappen was adjudged fair, although Norris felt he had been pushed off by the Dutchman and noted pointedly he felt that Verstappen’s elbows-out approach had been expected and ultimately detrimental.</p> <p>“He’s fighting hard, but it’s up to him to do that,” Norris said. “He’s ruining his own race, he’s not racing very smart. He’s fighting, that is always expected, but that’s what it is.”</p> <p>Piastri now has four wins from six races this season to one for Norris and he leads his teammate by 16 points and Verstappen by 32. On the form of the McLaren in Miami, the championship battle is increasingly looking like it will develop into a straight fight between the two McLaren drivers.</p> <p>A crucial element of the race was Piastri’s overtake of Verstappen for the lead but when Norris followed suit, it took him four laps including one pass at turn 11 where he had to give the place back because he had gone off track to complete the manoeuvre. During that period Piastri opened up an eight-second lead that Norris was unable to recover.</p> <p>With the two drivers likely going head to head for the title, Stella believed there were still only tiny margins that ultimately separated them. “Had Lando not gone off by a few centimetres in corner 11, he would have completed the overtaking in what was a similar time,” he said. “So we should not read too much into situations, it’s a matter sometimes of a fraction of a second or a fraction of a metre.</p> <p>“The big time loss came because of having to give back the position. So in terms of overtaking, manoeuvring, precision and determination, I don’t see that there’s any difference between the two drivers.”</p>",

Not only did they know things like everyone’s education level, marital status and income but, crucially, whether they exercised and how happy they felt, and how all this changed over time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/09/olympic-programme-additions-la-2028-olympic-games\">LA 2028 Olympics adds swimming sprints and mixed-gender gymnastics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For their latest paper, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953625002503#b35\">Passing on the flame: Do mega sports events promote health behaviours?</a> they focused on whether the Olympics encouraged London residents to exercise more. And, if so, did it stick? </p> <p>The answers? A little. And a chastening no.</p> <p>There was, the academics found, an increase in physical activity by six percentage points among the most inactive people in London – the 34% of residents who didn’t usually exercise at all. Perhaps more surprisingly, there was also less alcohol and tobacco consumed by Londoners during the Games.</p> <p>However, there was a kicker: within 100 days of the Olympic flame being put out, all that good stuff had disappeared. “We always hear these grand claims from politicians about how the Olympics has a lasting impact on healthy behaviours, but this does not hold up to reality,” Dr Christian Krekel of the London School of Economics said. “Our research shows that London 2012 nudged some previously inactive people to engage in physical activity. But once the event ends, it fades quite quickly.”</p> <p>Krekel, who also advises governments on how to use wellbeing data for policy analysis, wasn’t surprised. “Even with financial incentives, it is hard to get people to become physically active,” he said. “Even when you pay people to go to the gym, it works for a while, but then the numbers return to the baseline.”</p> <p>So what else have we learned from this treasure trove of data? First, that the Olympics <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272719300957]\">really does improve people’s perceptions of their life satisfaction</a> – and not just in the host city. </p> <p>Intriguingly, people’s wellbeing during the 2012 Games all went up in London, Berlin and Paris compared to the previous year. However, in London it climbed by an entire point on the Likert scale – which is used to measure attitudes or beliefs – from 6.3 to 7.3 after the opening ceremony. While in Berlin it rose by 0.3 and Paris 0.1 points.</p>    <p>The increase in satisfaction was broadly similar regardless of sex or age, but tended to be higher among higher-income households. However once again the effects wore off fast.</p> <p>“In terms of potential ‘legacy’ effects, we find that the intangible impact of the Olympics appears to be short-lived,” the researchers noted. “While the effects are especially strong around the opening and closing ceremonies, we do not find strong evidence of lasting changes in subjective wellbeing in the host city one year after the event.”</p> <p>What about the idea that winning medals can lift a nation’s mood? Alas, that doesn’t seem to be the case with researchers finding “little evidence” that people in the three European capitals were happier the day after Team GB, France and Germany achieved glory.</p> <p>“The ‘happiness dividend’ appears to be a function of hosting per se and not a function of sporting success measured by gold medals won,” they add.</p> <p>There is, of course, an entirely reasonable counter-argument. Would the government have pumped so much investment into the regeneration of East London without Britain hosting the Games? Probably not. A couple of years ago, Sir Craig Reedie, a member of the London organising committee, also told me that 135,000 new jobs had been created in the area in a decade.</p> <p>For those of us who love sport, the summer of 2012 was also a fantastic joyride. The fact that people’s happiness went up across London, Paris, Berlin during those Games also suggests that the Olympics is a global public good that has positive spillover effects beyond whatever country is hosting it.</p> <p>However, whenever politicians dangle the possibility of a fresh Olympic bid they should also be honest. The Games won’t lead to huge economic benefits. The bill for London 2012, for instance, came in at £9bn – three times more than envisaged. And, as this new research shows, the “intangible” benefits of legacy, such as making us feel better for longer, don’t really stand up to scrutiny either.</p> <p>Meanwhile whatever Khan says about backing a bid for London 2040, it is almost certainly not going to happen. Most insiders I spoke to last week expect India to get the 2036 Games, while Saudi Arabia are strong favourites for 2040. Quietly, they concede, 2044 or even 2048 is more realistic.</p> <p>Incidentally, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi is already promising that if his country wins the 2036 Games it will lead to a surge in tourism, provide long-term economic benefits, and India harnessing the power of sport to create a healthier nation. It is an alluring and familiar tune. But history tells us it might sound rather more discordant in the future.</p>",

I’ve still got my fire in my belly,” he said. “I’m not going to apologise for being a fighter. I’m not going to apologise for still wanting it. I know everyone in the team does too.”</p> <p>Hamilton finished eighth in the race which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/may/04/miami-grand-prix-2025-formula-one-live\">won in dominant style by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri</a>. During the race Hamilton asked Ferrari to have his teammate Charles Leclerc, who was in front, switch places with him as the British driver was clearly quicker.</p> <p>He was exasperated at the time the team took took to make the call, dismissively stating, “have a tea break while you’re at it”. He also referred to it as “not good teamwork” and later, after the team switched the two drivers places back, asked with no little sarcasm whether he should also give up a place to the chasing Williams of Carlos Sainz.</p>    <p>However he played down the significance of the exchanges and revealed he and team principal Fred Vasseur had spoken almost immediately after the race, with Hamilton making sure the air was clear between them.</p> <p>“Fred came to my room, I just put my hand on his shoulder and was like, ‘dude, calm down, don’t be so sensitive’,” he said. “I could have said way worse things on the radio. You hear some of the things others have said in the past, some of it was sarcasm. Look, you’ve got to understand we’re under a huge amount of pressure within the car.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/04/miami-grand-prix-gardens-neighborhood-black-residents\">The other side of the track: Miami Gardens’ Black residents grapple with F1’s effects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“You’re never going to get the most peaceful messages coming through in the heat of the battle. It wasn’t even anger. It wasn’t effing and blinding and anything like that. It’s like, make a decision. You’re sitting there on the chair, you’ve got the stuff in front of you, make the decision, quick. That’s how I was, I was me. We’re in a panic, we’re trying to keep the car on the track. We’re computing things fast.”</p> <p>Vasseur maintained he was happy with the way the team had called their decisions and that he understood his driver’s position.</p> <p>“I had a discussion with Lewis and I can perfectly understand the frustration,” he said “They are champions, they want to win races. It’s not easy. It’s never easy. And I didn’t see another team to do it today. That’s why we took the responsibility to do it. We are racing for Ferrari first and honestly I think as a team we did a good job.”</p> <p>Vasseur also confirmed that the team’s policy if they switch driver positions to allow one to attack a car ahead, and if no advantage is gained and a position is not made, they will revert to the original order as they did in Miami.</p>",
